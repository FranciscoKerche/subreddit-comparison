    "selftext": "So my mum has been pushing me and my dad to get our hair cut recently. Neither of our hair is as long as we usually have it by the time we get it cut. My dad decided he didn't want to pay for a hairdresser to do it and got me to do it instead.\n\nToday was going pretty normally until my dad asked me to cut his hair, which was fine, I have done it once or twice before, particularly once in the pandemic. He was being pretty pushy about getting it done early today but it's whatever, that's kinda what he's like. \n\nSo I ended up doing it in our back garden, got the back and the ears done, really just needed to trim down the top of his hair a bit and he would have been done probably. \n\nNow my dad is in his 60's and he's gone grey, but his hair growth has not slowed down significantly, he still grows it at a decent rate. That's important for this next bit.\n\nAlso probably worth noting I'm probably a little autistic, and care a lot less than most people about what random people on the street think, butttt I was thinking he's retired, he's not got to go to anything too important, anytime soon... Fuck it sounds like a good time to play a bit of a practical joke on him... \n\n*So I put the shaver at the top of his head, and shaved straight forwards*\n\nIt was funny in the moment, it really was, buuuuut after a couple of seconds he realised the significance of it and reminded me that he is going on holiday for a week in a few weeks, which I had forgotten about...\n\nSo he told me to get my mum to try and fix it, so I sent her down and tbh I think she laughed for longer than I did, I don't think I've ever heard her laugh so hard. But after she stopped laughing and I came downstairs to try and help it was immediately clear that he was pretty upset by the whole thing, even crying which is maybe the 3rd time I've ever seen him cry, which really pissed my mum off for obvious reasons.\n\nAfter I left them to it again, she talked with a few friends who have relatives who are hairdressers and unsurprisingly, he probably has to go bald really. He might have not minded being bald, had he had a choice in the matter, but he definitely did not like the idea of it when i suggested it not long after. \n\nMy mum told me to get out and get my hair done at a hairdressers before they do the same to me, which he might not be willing to do but she definitely would. \n\nSo that's where I'm going right now. Thinking of having mine cut particularly short as a bit of an apology. \n\nHe should be fine, apparently average hair growth is half a inch per month, so give it a month and it'll just look short, by Christmas it should look neat.\n\nMistakes were made.\n\nTldr: dad asked me to cut hair, but he didn't like the haircut I gave him, so he's opting to probably go bald instead.",

As it turns out we are best friends and get along great.  \n\nYesterday after work he came by to take care of me because I wasn\u2019t feeling well.  He made me dinner and we laid in bed watching tv.  I finally started to feel better and asked if he wanted a back rub as a reward for doting on me the last few days.  He enthusiastically agreed.  \n\nI just treated myself to new lotion from bath and body works so I grabbed the bottles and had him smell them to pick his favorite.  It was dark, the only light was from the tv.  I slathered him with the lotion thick because it smelled so good. Gave him an amazing back rub and we both fell asleep.  \n\nThis morning at 6 am he woke up realizing he fell asleep at my place, and was late for work.  Not wanting to wake me he got up and threw on clothes in the dark and left.  \n\nA side note is he is a foreman for a large tree company.  He works with a bunch of dudes and they are all manly and will tease each other endlessly.  \n\nWhen I finally woke up, I was confused because it looked like my hands were covered in gold sparkly paint.  I finally figured it out that for some reason the lotion had thick gold glitter in it.  \n\nI text him to alert him that he was covered in very noticeable glitter but I was too late, the boys have already noticed.  It\u2019s two hours into his work day and the teasing as only just began.  He messaged me back that this probably makes us official as the crew will never let him live this down and I\u2019ve officially marked my territory.  \n\nTLDR- gave my situationship a back rub in the dark not realizing the new lotion I used has lots of glitter in it, he woke up late, threw on clothes, and went to work covered in very noticeable gold glitter.  \n\nEdit: apparently glowtion = glitter lotion.

    "selftext": "So, for context, we had known eachother for only a short time before this, but the relationship between us had developed very quickly and you could possibly even have called it \u201dlove at first sight\u201d. \n\nThen some complications appeared, because she had been planning to move to a different country in under a year\u2019s time, which shook me a lot. I felt very depressed about the fact that me and her could never last, but I still wanted to experience knowing her even if it was only for a few months. The feeling was not mutual.\n\nSo today, after our relationship had started falling apart a couple of days ago, I decided to go wait outside her apartment for her to come home. My thoughts prior to this were just to talk to her, straighten everything out between us, decide what we\u2019re gonna do going forward and then maybe say our goodbyes and never speak again. \n\nMy mistake, however, was that I had not thought at all about how it\u2019s gonna feel like to her to see me standing outside of her house unannounced if our feelings about talking aren\u2019t mutual. I was so blinded by my feelings for her that I hadn\u2019t thought about the possibility that she doesn\u2019t want to see me again.\n\nSo she walked to her street and we met. Our conversation was very short and didn\u2019t really have any meaning. The whole time she looked so uncomfortable and scared, and at that point it started to sink in what I really had done. She just finished the conversation quickly and walked inside.\n\nI instantly felt sick to my stomach thinking about what had just happened. I had really just stood outside someones house imagining that my romantic feelings we\u2019re going to be mutual with that person. I feel so terrible about the fact that I probably made her fear for her life or for her wellbeing by just wanting to talk to her. This goes against everything and anything I have ever thought or expected of myself and I feel absolutely disgusting right now. I can\u2019t believe I have actually done something like this.\n\nEven though my meaning really was only to talk to her and have a discussion about how we\u2019re gonna end things between us, I can\u2019t help but to feel like an absolute creep and harasser. I\u2019m a very emotional and caring person, so it\u2019s really hard for me to believe I have just done something that probably terrified the person I really cared about and had feelings for. I just walked away quickly, removed her number, blocked her on every social media and swore I would never be in contact with her again or do anything like this ever again. \n\nI\u2019m so fucking disappointed in myself. I can not believe I could make someone feel that way and not even think about it as a possibility beforehand. I feel like a creep, a stalker, and a harasser, and I don\u2019t know if I will ever forgive myself for doing something so stupid like this.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nI wanted to talk to my situationship but ended up looking like a creepy stalker because of my own stupidity and ignorance.",

Then when he asked if I had any questions, I told him that it probably worked if he gave me the assignment to see if I\u2019m a \u2018good fit\u2019.

Since I was off work, I mostly relaxed and used my laptop treating it as a nice evening/night to unwind as there was not much going on the week for me. Closer to the boarding time, I arrived at the gate and took a seat to wait to board for my flight.

Now, had this been an international flight, I probably would have been panicking but luckily it wasn't. I wasn't exactly going to go through the hassle of trying to get a flight rebooked with a gate agent for something that was my own fault so I had simply booked a last minute flight that was 8 hours later in the morning which was not that expensive and it was even with the same airline. I ended up continuing to sleep at the airport as a result internally facepalming myself over the extreme stupidity of what I had done and then woke up a bit earlier to prepare to board for my new flight this time and finally made it on my way.  Surprisingly, my return flight was not cancelled for being a no-show for the original outbound flight and I was even able to board and go on my way back home on the original return flight (and funnily enough, I ended up just sleeping for most of the flight and woke up just in time for descent).

    "selftext": "Today I fucked up. \n\nObligatory not today, but recently (for the past 2 months) I've been dealing with a host of random health issues. Being in my mid-twenties and always having had an easy time with my health it was honestly super strange. I had the distinct thought, \"Damn, this is what 24 is like huh?\" \n\nThe symptoms included diarrhea, difficulty breath, headaches, difficultly sleeping, difficulty thinking, and worst of all was an awful rash that started on every joint and would constantly be flaring up painfully everyday. I genuinely struggled with work in a way I hadn't in months, and these symptoms lasted 2 months.\n\nThe main symptom that really grabbed me was the rash, and as such I got first lotion on it since it sort of looked like dry skin. After 2 weeks of no progress, I moved on to an over the counter cream for anti-fungal and hydrocortisone. While the cortisone did help with the itch, it did nothing to stop the painful spread of the infection. After that I went to my pharmacist, and got some more creams that would help. They did not. \n\nIt wasn't until another week after trying those creams (almost 2 months from onset of symptoms) that I figured out what was going on from the most unlikely place. \n\nI don't watch Dr. House, but occasionally on YouTube Shorts I will be recommended clips from the show. During the clip that engrossed me on the toilet, Dr. House was chastising another doctor for not realizing the difference between Brazil and Bolivia, and that their patient was suffering from Selenium Poisoning from Brazil Nuts. \n\nTurns out that the maximum amount of Selenium that an adult should take in before having signs of toxicity is only 400 micrograms a day. Each nut has roughly 100 micrograms of Selenium. I was eating 12 a day because I'd heard they were good for testosterone production, and the Trader Joe's bag I'd bought had a serving size of a quarter cup (which is over the healthy limit). \n\nNow a few days after of no longer putting nuts in my mouth, I feel loads better and most of my symptoms have largely disappeared. \n\nI'm honestly making this post to hopefully save others from the same mistake, and to bring attention to the issue. I have a hard time that Trader Joe's suppliers who grow these for a living don't know the present and real danger the food possesses if eaten more than 2-3 nuts a day. I tried to give them feedback on the product to help them improve, but they've ignore my request for a week now and I thought others should know. \n\nTL;DR: I got a huge host of medical issues randomly, and turns out it was because I was eating my \"healthy snacks\". Brazil nuts can quickly poison you if consumed more than a 1-3 nuts daily, and Trader Joe's recommends eating 30+ on their packaging. \n\nEdited to add: I had originally said 30 nuts is a quarter cup, but was only doing that based on some incorrect nutrition site. People pointed out the error in the comments and broke down the math. It's still unhealthy with the amount recommended in the serving size. ",

    "selftext": "This was preceded by a long line of various other fuckups. He (23M), I'll call him M, and I (28F), friends for four years, both have depression and social anxiety. The first fuckup was I developed a crush on him... after getting over a rebound crush on his best friend three months earlier which ended because *that* guy ostracized me from my friend group because his girlfriend hated me. I confessed to M five months ago. He didn't feel the same way. He said he didn't want to make things awkward and that we were still friends. He moved on from it. I still have feelings. For four months it wasn't an issue, we hung out like normal online and there was no awkwardness.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago. M and I and two other married friends all went on a camping trip together. They have a one bedroom apartment and one vehicle, and we all mutually decided to make that work. This was my first time seeing M in person in three years. From the minute we picked him up at the airport, he made a concerted effort to not look me in the eye as much as he possibly could. Often when I spoke to him, he'd look over my head or to the side of me. I felt pretty insulted by it, but I said nothing. Other than that and not particularly wanting to be near me, he talked normally, except whenever we were alone together when it was dead silence. In two words, very awkward.\n\nApparently my second fuck up was my trying to sit next to him in the car for the drive to the state park, which I admit, yeah, a not insignificant part was me wanting to sit next to him. But also because a large part of it was because there were four of us trying to cram four people's and one small dog's worth of camping shit into a goddamn compact crossover with a trunk the size of a postage stamp. I'm a small person, and if you put me in the middle seat, there'd have been *sooo* much more space in the empty seat next to me for stuff, but M insisted I didn't need to. Instead I spent the four hour roundtrip squashed up against the car door, unable to move an inch, because his shit and other random shit was falling into me from the middle seat, in addition to various heavy articles sitting on top of my feet and cutting off their circulation.\n\nFast forward to when we're all back home. M doesn't talk to me for a week. He doesn't get on voice chat when I'm online in voice chat. I start panicking because anxiety and I'm terrified I offended him. I message him and ask him if I make him uncomfortable. No response for two days. I talk to my other friend (28M), I'll call him G, who went on the camping trip with us and asked him if he knew what I did to make M uncomfortable. I was already starting to spiral, and I forgot that G has a tendency to blab while also grossly exaggerating or twisting around things other people said/did. G told me M was annoyed with me constantly putting myself down and talking about sad/depressing things in my life during the whole trip.\n\nI had no idea I was even doing it. I thought I was just being myself, and I thought everybody had a good time because everybody said afterward they had a good time, including M. I struggle with body-focused anxiety, body dysmorphia, and PTSD from being bullied/abused in school. Every day is a fight not to let the bad thoughts win. I'm trying my hardest. G also said I made M uncomfortable by trying to sit next to him in the car, that he took it as an advance toward him. I had no idea any of this was going on because M said nothing to me about it the whole trip.\n\nThen the huge fuckup... I had a mental breakdown and went off on M. I sent him several angry messages asking why he didn't just tell me I made him uncomfortable, sarcastically apologizing for not handling my depression as well as he does, and accusing him of being a hypocrite for being annoyed by my depression, because he constantly, *constantly*, makes jokes about offing himself and I say nothing, even though it makes me and G's spouse very uncomfortable, because that's his \"coping mechanism\". Worst of all, I told M never to talk to me again and unfriended him on everything. I instantly regretted it next morning because M doesn't like confrontation and basically shuts off whenever there's conflict, so I knew he wouldn't even try to respond. I talked to G's spouse, and they were angry at G for sticking his nose into everyone's business and reminded me that G has problems with that and twisting information and that I need to have a conversation with M about it.\n\nAfter spending the day alternately sobbing, panicking and hating myself, I messaged him apologizing for yelling at him and said I jumped to too many conclusions based on what G said. I was so sure that M would never talk to me, so I got all my (false?) information from G, when instead I should've just waited and talked to M. Or waited and did nothing instead of going ballistic. M hasn't been online at all in two days. I just hope he's okay.\n\nTL;DR: I made my friend uncomfortable during a group camping trip, and instead of waiting and talking to him about it, I went and got a bunch of misinformation about it, yelled at him for being a hypocrite, and now he probably won't talk to me ever again.",

I thought I was just being myself, and I thought everybody had a good time because everybody said afterward they had a good time, including M. I struggle with body-focused anxiety, body dysmorphia, and PTSD from being bullied/abused in school. Every day is a fight not to let the bad thoughts win. I&amp;#39;m trying my hardest. G also said I made M uncomfortable by trying to sit next to him in the car, that he took it as an advance toward him. I had no idea any of this was going on because M said nothing to me about it the whole trip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the huge fuckup... I had a mental breakdown and went off on M. I sent him several angry messages asking why he didn&amp;#39;t just tell me I made him uncomfortable, sarcastically apologizing for not handling my depression as well as he does, and accusing him of being a hypocrite for being annoyed by my depression, because he constantly, &lt;em&gt;constantly&lt;/em&gt;, makes jokes about offing himself and I say nothing, even though it makes me and G&amp;#39;s spouse very uncomfortable, because that&amp;#39;s his &amp;quot;coping mechanism&amp;quot;. Worst of all, I told M never to talk to me again and unfriended him on everything. I instantly regretted it next morning because M doesn&amp;#39;t like confrontation and basically shuts off whenever there&amp;#39;s conflict, so I knew he wouldn&amp;#39;t even try to respond. I talked to G&amp;#39;s spouse, and they were angry at G for sticking his nose into everyone&amp;#39;s business and reminded me that G has problems with that and twisting information and that I need to have a conversation with M about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After spending the day alternately sobbing, panicking and hating myself, I messaged him apologizing for yelling at him and said I jumped to too many conclusions based on what G said. I was so sure that M would never talk to me, so I got all my (false?) information from G, when instead I should&amp;#39;ve just waited and talked to M. Or waited and did nothing instead of going ballistic. M hasn&amp;#39;t been online at all in two days. I just hope he&amp;#39;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I made my friend uncomfortable during a group camping trip, and instead of waiting and talking to him about it, I went and got a bunch of misinformation about it, yelled at him for being a hypocrite, and now he probably won&amp;#39;t talk to me ever again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My first thought was that he was going to ask if I could make something for him, which is something I'm used to, but instead he comes back and starts explaining that his daughter is currently going to school for graphic design. I said that's awesome and he asked if I could do him a favor and wait a moment while he called her, I said yes. \n\nThis is where things got messy.

We both had no idea what was happening, I don't know what her Father thought we were going to discuss but the exchange that followed was a series of awkward hellos and mumbled confusion as I tried to ask what he wanted me to say to her. He just kept gesturing and saying \"Talk with her\", but I wasn't prepared or comfortable talking about a job I'm new to myself, and it was obvious from her voice that she was also uncomfortable, so I just said I'm sorry and gave the phone back. \n\nHer Father seemed to finally realize he had created a very uncomfortable situation, thanked me, and then left.

Meaning I don't really have much of a support system here and have to leave the country if I don't work. I immediately texted my bf about it but couldn't take any of his calls afterward because I still was required to end my shift.

He came in every 10 Minutes or so to look after me but didn't say anything, so I also didn't say anything and I just felt ignored and became more irritated the longer he stayed without doing anything. \n\nAt some point he realised I was awake and tried talking to me. I was still feeling many negative things, yet nothing at all and couldn't deal with anything anymore, so I shut everything down and just kept telling him that I've got nothing to say, nothing makes sense and he should leave, to the point I actually offered him money just to leave me alone. He finally concluded that I must be suicidal (he knows I used to be a while before we got together) and got scared I would do something horrible if I left (which admittedly I did and sometimes still do consider - but I'm a coward and would never actually act on it). There was a lot of back and forth that ended in me luring him out of my flat and stealing my keys back so he couldn't get back in. He obviously was very worried and I heard trough my window that he called friend before he went home. I fell asleep shortly after. \n\nIt's now the evening of the next day and I still haven't taken any of his calls. I have also received several texts and calls from mutual friends and his mom. I can't pick up or answer, I'm not sure why, guess I'm still paralyzed and in denial, haven't been able to really process anything. And now a bunch of people now about something I haven't even fully realised myself and think I'm dead or something. Also I'm incredibly confused that my bf is so worried that he tells everyone about it, except actual authorities who could do something about someone actually being suicidal???

I think there is no coming back and I ruined our relationship forever. There's no way he could or should trust me again after this.

    "selftext": "So, I (22M) matched with this beautiful girl (22F) on Hinge last week. She was the one who commented on my profile first, and I matched with her back because she\u2019s gorgeous. For context, we\u2019re both in Southern California. She\u2019s currently pursuing her master\u2019s degree, while I\u2019ve recently graduated with my bachelor\u2019s and now have a full-time job.\n\nHere\u2019s how everything played out. We met in person for the first time during a weeknight at an outdoor mall restaurant. We hugged when we saw each other, had a good meal, and got to know each other a bit. Afterward, we saw Smile 2, a horror movie, and ended up cuddling in the theater. The first date went really well\u2014we broke the touch barrier, and she seemed to enjoy my company, laughing at my jokes and staying close to me.\n\nOur second date was two days later, on Friday night, and it was even better. I won\u2019t go into too much detail, but we ate out, went to the beach, and spent the whole evening together. By this point, we were really comfortable with each other, and I could tell she was attracted to me. After dinner, we got some food to-go near her place (I was the one driving since she lives with a roommate, and I live with my parents). She suggested eating at her apartment, and I agreed.\n\nAt her place, we ate, made out, cuddled, and then she fell asleep in my arms\u2014her head resting on my chest and her leg draped over me. It felt amazing. I ended up spending the entire weekend with her.\n\nSaturday and Sexual Anxiety\nOn Saturday, we had an incredible time. We took pictures, went to a pumpkin patch, visited the zoo, ate good food, and caught another movie. At this point, we\u2019d spent almost every waking moment together. I also slept over at her apartment again, but there was still no sex. I have to admit, I\u2019ve only had sex once before, and I get anxious when it comes to initiating. She seemed to really want it, but I kept holding back, partly because of my lack of experience and partly due to sexual anxiety.\n\nI think what makes things more complicated is that I\u2019m into some kinky stuff\u2014CBT, facesitting, feet, domination\u2014and I wasn\u2019t sure how to bring that up. She strikes me as more submissive and gentle, and I didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d be open to it. I kept stalling, telling myself I\u2019d make a move eventually. But when she kissed me the next morning and teased, \u201cI\u2019ll take all my clothes off right now, what do you wanna do?\u201d I still couldn\u2019t do it. I told her, \u201cLet\u2019s eat first and go out\u2014we\u2019ll do it tonight.\u201d She seemed a little disappointed but didn\u2019t push me.\n\nWe spent the day at the Pike Outlets in Long Beach, enjoying ourselves again, but I knew I was running out of excuses.\n\nThe Night It Fell Apart\nThat night, we went back to her apartment. Things escalated\u2014we kissed, made out, and started taking each other\u2019s clothes off. We were in her room, the lights dimmed, and the moment felt right. But when it came time for things to get physical, I couldn\u2019t stay hard. She tried giving me a handjob, but it didn\u2019t help. I suggested she sit on my lap to get things going\u2014sometimes that works for me\u2014but even then, I kept losing my erection.\n\nAt this point, I felt humiliated. I hated myself. I was trying so hard to make it work, suggesting different positions, but they were all pretty vanilla since I didn\u2019t know how to introduce the kinks I\u2019m into. Normal sex doesn\u2019t turn me on the same way kink does, and I felt trapped. I wanted to ask her to be more dominant or to grab me in a certain way, but I was too scared to bring it up.\n\nAfter an hour of trying, I asked her to grab my balls while she gave me a handjob\u2014it\u2019s something that worked with an ex who was also into kink. But this time, it didn\u2019t have the same effect. Eventually, she just collapsed face-down on the bed in silence. I felt awful.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, she started crying.\n\nThe Aftermath\nAt first, I thought she was crying because I was terrible in bed. But she told me that wasn\u2019t it\u2014she thought I wasn\u2019t attracted to her. She kept saying she felt ugly, and it broke my heart. I tried to comfort her, telling her she was beautiful and that I was absolutely attracted to her. She really is stunning\u2014she\u2019s a dancer with an amazing body and the sweetest personality\u2014but I didn\u2019t know how to explain that my struggles were more about me and my sexual preferences.\n\nI spent the next hour holding her, reassuring her, and telling her how gorgeous she is. But she kept crying, convinced that she wasn\u2019t enough for me. It was devastating. Honestly, I would have preferred if she had been angry at me\u2014it felt so much worse knowing she thought she wasn\u2019t attractive.\n\nEventually, I left that night. I told her I had to go home for work, but she was worried I\u2019d ghost her. I reassured her that wasn\u2019t the case, but I felt like I\u2019d already hurt her deeply.\n\nWhere We Are Now\nShe\u2019s still texting me and even calling me \u201cbabe\u201d\u2014it\u2019s like she really wants me in her life. She told me I\u2019m the best guy she\u2019s ever been with (though obviously not sexually), and I feel the same way about her. I really care about her, and we have an amazing bond. But I\u2019m still terrified about the sexual side of things.\n\nI want her to know what I\u2019m into, but I\u2019m scared she won\u2019t understand or that it\u2019ll push her away. She seems more submissive, and I don\u2019t know if she\u2019d be comfortable taking on a more dominant role. I think she\u2019d be willing to try for me, but I don\u2019t want to overwhelm her or make her uncomfortable.\n\nTL;DR:\nI couldn\u2019t get it up for my girlfriend because I\u2019m into kink, and she seems more vanilla. She ended up thinking I wasn\u2019t attracted to her and cried, even though I am attracted to her. She still wants to be with me, and we have a really close bond, but I\u2019m scared to tell her about my kinks and not sure how to move forward.\n\nAny advice is welcome, and no I don\u2019t watch porn ",

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I (22M) matched with this beautiful girl (22F) on Hinge last week. She was the one who commented on my profile first, and I matched with her back because she\u2019s gorgeous. For context, we\u2019re both in Southern California. She\u2019s currently pursuing her master\u2019s degree, while I\u2019ve recently graduated with my bachelor\u2019s and now have a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s how everything played out. We met in person for the first time during a weeknight at an outdoor mall restaurant. We hugged when we saw each other, had a good meal, and got to know each other a bit. Afterward, we saw Smile 2, a horror movie, and ended up cuddling in the theater. The first date went really well\u2014we broke the touch barrier, and she seemed to enjoy my company, laughing at my jokes and staying close to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our second date was two days later, on Friday night, and it was even better. I won\u2019t go into too much detail, but we ate out, went to the beach, and spent the whole evening together. By this point, we were really comfortable with each other, and I could tell she was attracted to me. After dinner, we got some food to-go near her place (I was the one driving since she lives with a roommate, and I live with my parents). She suggested eating at her apartment, and I agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At her place, we ate, made out, cuddled, and then she fell asleep in my arms\u2014her head resting on my chest and her leg draped over me. It felt amazing. I ended up spending the entire weekend with her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saturday and Sexual Anxiety\nOn Saturday, we had an incredible time. We took pictures, went to a pumpkin patch, visited the zoo, ate good food, and caught another movie. At this point, we\u2019d spent almost every waking moment together. I also slept over at her apartment again, but there was still no sex. I have to admit, I\u2019ve only had sex once before, and I get anxious when it comes to initiating. She seemed to really want it, but I kept holding back, partly because of my lack of experience and partly due to sexual anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think what makes things more complicated is that I\u2019m into some kinky stuff\u2014CBT, facesitting, feet, domination\u2014and I wasn\u2019t sure how to bring that up. She strikes me as more submissive and gentle, and I didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d be open to it. I kept stalling, telling myself I\u2019d make a move eventually. But when she kissed me the next morning and teased, \u201cI\u2019ll take all my clothes off right now, what do you wanna do?\u201d I still couldn\u2019t do it. I told her, \u201cLet\u2019s eat first and go out\u2014we\u2019ll do it tonight.\u201d She seemed a little disappointed but didn\u2019t push me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We spent the day at the Pike Outlets in Long Beach, enjoying ourselves again, but I knew I was running out of excuses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Night It Fell Apart\nThat night, we went back to her apartment. Things escalated\u2014we kissed, made out, and started taking each other\u2019s clothes off. We were in her room, the lights dimmed, and the moment felt right. But when it came time for things to get physical, I couldn\u2019t stay hard. She tried giving me a handjob, but it didn\u2019t help. I suggested she sit on my lap to get things going\u2014sometimes that works for me\u2014but even then, I kept losing my erection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I felt humiliated. I hated myself. I was trying so hard to make it work, suggesting different positions, but they were all pretty vanilla since I didn\u2019t know how to introduce the kinks I\u2019m into. Normal sex doesn\u2019t turn me on the same way kink does, and I felt trapped.

    "selftext": "About three or four months ago, I did something truly terrible that changed how I see myself. It\u2019s one of those moments that will stick with me forever\u2014kind of funny and yet profoundly embarrassing.\n\nSo, there I was at a family party, which was a big deal because my family is enormous. I\u2019m talking about all my dad\u2019s sisters, their kids, and everyone was having a blast. The venue had a pool divided into sections for kids and adults, and things were going great until a weird incident changed everything.\n\nI was in a room with some cousins. We were singing, dancing, and just being silly, with music blasting. Then, as it often does at parties, there was that awkward silence between songs. Suddenly, we heard someone banging on the door. It was one of the adults, and she yelled, \u201cWho can swim? Your brother is drowning!\u201d\n\nEveryone in the room sprang into action, rushing out to help. But for some reason, I stayed behind, calmly talking to the woman and asking what was going on. She looked at me in disbelief, insisting I should help my brother. I kept insisting he was fine, just splashing around in the pool. Meanwhile, my mind was completely frozen.\n\nFinally, I decided to join everyone outside, only to find that my brother had been wearing a floating device that helped him swim, and he was heading toward the adult section where he really shouldn\u2019t have been. He was the only one swimming there when suddenly, the floating device popped, and all the air inside it went out. My mom jumped in to help him, and she was grabbing onto the edge of the pool, then she walked toward my brother. When she realized that she couldn\u2019t reach him because she was small and the pool was too deep, she went back to the edge of the pool and kept trying to get to him multiple times, despite how difficult it was. She later told my dad that in those moments, she felt like she wanted to die(That\u2019s why she kept trying to save my brother, knowing that she couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d rather die trying to help her son than watch him drown in front of her). My grandma jumped in too, but when she noticed she couldn\u2019t reach the bottom, she stopped. By the time I came back, everything was already happening. They were trying to get my brother out of the pool, and I felt so late to the whole situation\n\nAs I watched my family struggle, my thoughts turned dark and selfish. All I could think was how this would ruin the party. I remember thinking, \u201cGreat, we\u2019ll leave early now. My mom\u2019s going to hate pools.\u201d I felt like a terrible person, especially knowing that my younger sister were being more helpful than I was.\n\nEventually, my brother was rescued by someone who actually knew how to swim. I stood awkwardly smiling while everyone else rushed to help. When it was over, I was left feeling ashamed. I had brought towels and napkins, but in my mind, I was still processing the absurdity of the situation.\n\nLater that day, we wrapped up the night with my brother going back to swim, and I joined him too. But it didn\u2019t stop there. When everything happened, I went back to my cousins,\u2014the ones I was dancing with\u2014who were all yelling at me, cussing me out. \u201cWhat the heck were you doing? Why were you so silent?\u201d they asked. I tried to lighten the mood by saying, \u201cOh my God, let me tell you what was going through my mind!\u201d But they were so judgmental about what I did. I felt awful, but I just kept joking around to cope.\n\nAt one point, they yelled at me to bring water, so I did. But as I was going to get it, I couldn\u2019t help but think, \u201cWhy would I bring water if my grandma or my mom was, like, drowning with water?\u201d I was trying to make light of the situation, but deep down, I felt like the worst person ever.\n\nThat car ride home was silent, filled with my thoughts about the whole ordeal. I couldn\u2019t shake the embarrassment and regret. That moment haunts me, reminding me of how unprepared I was when my family needed me the most.\n\nTL;DR: Thought my brother was just goofing off in the pool at a family party until his floatie popped and he started drowning. Stood around uselessly while everyone else jumped in to save him(he ended up not dying). Still feel like the worst person ever for it",

    "selftext": "A couple of days ago, my girlfriend and I were hanging out at my place. We\u2019re watching our favorite YouTube series when things got intimate. In the middle of our intimate moment, I had remembered the last time we did it I had tried out a new position that she enjoyed, and I had wanted to try it again. At first, everything was fine. We were both enjoying ourselves thoroughly until I had slipped out and in the hear the moment I had quickly try to put it back in, however, with the speed at which I was putting it back in the dim lights of the room in the slippery lube that was applied I had accidentally penetrated her backdoor . Right as I entered the tip, she started screaming and I had pulled out immediately. She started shaking and crying on the floor, telling me to stay away from her and stood there in shock and horror at what I had just done. After a few moments, she had calmed down enough for us to sit down and talk about it. It took roughly half an hour before she started feeling \u201cnormal\u201d again although the pain was still there. She decided to take a nap for about an hour and as we were laying together, I could hear softly her saying \u201cno\u201d and \u201cit hurts\u201d.

We\u2019re watching our favorite YouTube series when things got intimate. In the middle of our intimate moment, I had remembered the last time we did it I had tried out a new position that she enjoyed, and I had wanted to try it again. At first, everything was fine. We were both enjoying ourselves thoroughly until I had slipped out and in the hear the moment I had quickly try to put it back in, however, with the speed at which I was putting it back in the dim lights of the room in the slippery lube that was applied I had accidentally penetrated her backdoor . Right as I entered the tip, she started screaming and I had pulled out immediately. She started shaking and crying on the floor, telling me to stay away from her and stood there in shock and horror at what I had just done. After a few moments, she had calmed down enough for us to sit down and talk about it. It took roughly half an hour before she started feeling \u201cnormal\u201d again although the pain was still there. She decided to take a nap for about an hour and as we were laying together, I could hear softly her saying \u201cno\u201d and \u201cit hurts\u201d. At the time I had thought I had misheard her or that I was simply hearing things as I had a history of hearing things when no one said anything or completely misinterpreting what someone said.

I thought \"What the hell, if she wants it this one time... why not let her?\". \n\nFast forward to 2AM and my GF is plastered, stumbling and slurring her words. When I saw her falling asleep in her chair and almost slipping to the floor, I decided it was time to put her in bed. \n\nI took her back to our hotel room, undressed her, and laid her in bed; then, she said she was going to be sick. So I got her up again, walked her to the toilet, and fulfilled my gentleman\u2019s duty holding her hair while she threw up.\n\nAnd that's when the weird boner happened: I got rock-hard down there and kind of aroused while she gagged and spewed wedding cake.

We wanted to start the weekend with sex, so we got right into it shortly after checking into the resort. The luggage we used had previously been used on a family trip with the kids, and we had some poured some liquid children\u2019s Advil into a small Tupperware shot glass container with a lid. We used the same type of container on this trip and filled it with coconut oil, which is our go to. They apparently have similar viscosities. In the heat of the moment I grabbed the wrong one and used it without hesitation. Everything seemed fine until I switched up the pace by going down on her. I noticed that she tasted\u2026.. fruity. Like a strange chemical cherry flavour. I took me a couple minutes to realize what was going on and it was at the moment I knew I\u2019d fucked up. I stopped, the wife asked what was up and I had to tell her that I\u2019d just fucked her with Advil. Oddly, it was very difficult to find information on Google about the safety of Advil that\u2019s been liberally applied to the inside of a vagina. However my wife is a trooper and after a few minutes when everything seemed to be fine, we grabbed the correct product and finished the deed. No harmful after effects. \n\nTL/DR - accidentally used Advil as lube and there were no harmful consequences. ",

We wanted to start the weekend with sex, so we got right into it shortly after checking into the resort. The luggage we used had previously been used on a family trip with the kids, and we had some poured some liquid children\u2019s Advil into a small Tupperware shot glass container with a lid. We used the same type of container on this trip and filled it with coconut oil, which is our go to. They apparently have similar viscosities. In the heat of the moment I grabbed the wrong one and used it without hesitation. Everything seemed fine until I switched up the pace by going down on her. I noticed that she tasted\u2026.. fruity. Like a strange chemical cherry flavour. I took me a couple minutes to realize what was going on and it was at the moment I knew I\u2019d fucked up. I stopped, the wife asked what was up and I had to tell her that I\u2019d just fucked her with Advil. Oddly, it was very difficult to find information on Google about the safety of Advil that\u2019s been liberally applied to the inside of a vagina. However my wife is a trooper and after a few minutes when everything seemed to be fine, we grabbed the correct product and finished the deed. No harmful after effects. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL/DR - accidentally used Advil as lube and there were no harmful consequences. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "This post is intended to accompany my other post, as a potential explanation.\n\nA bit of backstory, my family has been neighbours with another family since I was 4. Let\u2019s call them the Smith family. The Smiths have 2 kids, Michael (26m) and Nicky (21m). Nicky is a year older than me and hung out with my younger brother (16m) and me (20m) during our childhood.\n\nGrowing up, Nicky was always stronger than us. He probably wasn\u2019t as bad as others, but he would often resort to violence whenever we didn\u2019t please him. One memory I have was during a sleepover, where my allergies caused me to make sounds. He would get up, come to me, and punch me several times. It was done repeatedly for each noise I made, getting harder each time.\u00a0\n\nMichael was kinder to us, never assaulting us. The issue was\u2026Michael would be violent towards Nicky instead. One memory I have is Michael kicking Nicky\u2019s back. I recall seeing Nicky cry from the bullying. Another more important memory, is a time where the Smith brothers and I were Kayaking. Michael tossed Nicky into the water, told him there were rocks, and kayaked away with me in it. He called Nicky a pussy, and said even I was braver than him. There might\u2019ve been a chain of violence. I\u2019m not innocent in terms of violence either. I made my younger brother cry and also got into a lot of fights at school, probably the most out of the 4 of us. Maybe it\u2019s just boys being boys.\n\nThis summer, I flew back home from college. Nicky was still abroad but Michael was home. In August, I went to visit him, he currently has his own place. We sat down and caught up with life.\n\nI decided to tell him about the [house fire](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nijmegen/comments/18uu2z1/i_feel_so_lost_update_to_the_electrician_scammer/) I had back in December. How unfairly I felt like I was treated, being blamed by my landlord for the fire just because of how it [looked](https://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/191rakq/can_a_kitchen_hood_catch_on_fire_on_its_own/), yet he isn't a professional and didn't request an investigation during the night of the incident, when the firefighters were there. After hearing the story, he said something along the lines of \u201cThe landlord could\u2019ve charged you more, so just be glad\". By now, I am 95% sure I didn\u2019t cause the fire, and I told Michael that. I also told him how frustrated I was that my parents paid the landlord 400 euros, to show that it was in the past. In the same conversation, I asked Michael if he got into fights at school. He said he didn\u2019t, because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t like causing trouble\u201d.\n\nAfter leaving the house, I kept thinking of the conversation we just had. The same person who abused his brother growing up, yet never fought anyone his own size, is telling me to let things go, to take the easy route, the pussy route. I often threw myself at bigger kids at school and even punched Nicky back a few times, so while I caused more trouble for my parents, I felt that I was more honourable.\n\nFast forward a few days, we were having a celebration for my younger brother\u2019s birthday. It wasn\u2019t his actual birthday, but we had an early celebration as his birthday fell on a school day (my university and my brother\u2019s high school have different academic calendars, being in different countries and all). My brother was going to have another, bigger celebration after I left. Little bro was hanging out with his friends in a different room, while I was sitting at a table with my dad and Michael. Michael asked what I\u2019d been up to.\u00a0\n\nMe: Oh, I\u2019ve been rehearsing\n\nMichael: Oh, for what?\n\nMe: Well, you see\n\nI brought up my observations about his behaviour growing up.\n\nSuddenly, my brother and his friends entered the room to ask my dad for something. I tried to quickly tell them to leave the room, looking back I could\u2019ve simply waited, but I panicked and just continued.\n\nMe: You\u2019re a pussy Michael.\n\nI don\u2019t quite remember the rest of the conversation, everyone was shocked. My mom entered the room, hearing the commotion. My dad recommends I leave to buy more pizzas with my mom, to which I comply, though not without saying \u201cGo fuck yourself\u201d while leaving the room, much to my dad\u2019s annoyance.\n\nOn the way to the store, I explained what happened to Mom. My mom says that it\u2019s just Michael\u2019s opinion. I told her how I felt like I was being victim-blamed, and combined with the bullying growing up, made things really frustrating. I also described my theory of the violent chain, how Michael hitting Nicky caused Nicky to take the anger out on us, making Michael potentially guilty of my childhood bullying.\n\nNonetheless, I understood that it was all in the past and that my behaviour was irrational. Once we got home, I went to apologize to Michael and explained why I was mad. He accepted my apology. He then explained that he wasn't blaming me or telling me to be grateful, more of looking at the positives, how my landlord could've made things more complicated by charging me the full amount, potentially leading to a lawsuit and hours of investigation. Later on, after leaving the country, I texted him, telling him that I was also a coward, making no effort to stand up to the [electrician ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nijmegen/comments/18a5525/was_i_scammed_am_i_entitled_to_a_refund/)because they might have social power over me.\n\nIn the end, I got mad at the wrong people, and let the incident cause me further trouble over 8 months later.\n\nTL;DR: Called a family friend a pussy in front of my brother during the latter\u2019s birthday over an opinion on an incident that happened 8 months prior.",

Fever spiked, breathing labored\u2014he has a history of asthma that we thought he was outgrowing. But the cough turned wheezy and I panicked.\n\nMy entire brain turned off and I went into helicopter parenting mode. Steam showers, inhaler, all the home remedies. He was still sick and I decided we had to go in for a breathing treatment. Turns out he didn\u2019t really need one, it\u2019s just the nature of this virus that he\u2019s going to sound wheezy and bad, especially at night, and he probably would have been fine to wait it out at home while I watched my friend\u2019s livestream.

I was so excited and proud and eager to show up for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two hours before it started, my sick kiddo took a turn for the worse. Fever spiked, breathing labored\u2014he has a history of asthma that we thought he was outgrowing. But the cough turned wheezy and I panicked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My entire brain turned off and I went into helicopter parenting mode. Steam showers, inhaler, all the home remedies. He was still sick and I decided we had to go in for a breathing treatment. Turns out he didn\u2019t really need one, it\u2019s just the nature of this virus that he\u2019s going to sound wheezy and bad, especially at night, and he probably would have been fine to wait it out at home while I watched my friend\u2019s livestream. I overreacted and skipped my friend\u2019s big moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m crushed by guilt and shame. It matters to show up for these kinds of accomplishments and I didn\u2019t, and it turns out my reason wasn\u2019t really a good reason afterall. I was just being an overly anxious parent. I wish I could turn back the clock and make another decision. I don\u2019t know how my friend feels that I missed it. He sent well wishes for my son\u2019s recovery, but I can\u2019t imagine he doesn\u2019t feel let down and disappointed. \u2639\ufe0f &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr I skipped an important moment in my friend\u2019s life bc I overreacted to my kid\u2019s virus and thought it was an emergency when it wasn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

When I joined college i had a boyfriend however we broke up because he sucked. In my new class (we are all stuck together for 2 years) I notice the most attractive man ever. I like older men usually like 25-26 the issues are so real. However this has been normal to me as my mom and step dad are 15 years apart. I meet this man let\u2019s call him James. James is 6\u20196 has 3 kids and is 40. I became extremely close with james, helping eachother with homework and just being best friends as we are stuck together 5 sometimes 6 days a week for 12+ hours per day. James has always looked out for me and everyone in class calls him the dad. Well fast forward half way through the program i started really thinking james is super hot and funny. So we start playful flirting etc \u2026 LAST WEEK i send him a nude during class or 2 and then he asks to get some drinks after class and just chat etc.. So we did and then it just got real talking abt deep stuff and sexual stuff. I had to go to work so I let him know i\u2019ll see him soon. I texted him saying i wanted to play in reference to sex and he said when he is off work to come over. Of course I do of course im nervous and of course i end up getting drunk bc i was nervous as did he. It was fire. I spent the night woke up and did it again then left and went to work. We text every day throughout the day. He has kids i am 20 what do i do if i think i have feelings for james? is this something i need to let go of or do i see it through? He is super busy a lot of the time but we got dinner yesterday with classmates and idk it just feels right but i am aware it might not be.  \n\nTL;DR : i\u2019m 20 and slept w my 40 yr old classmate.

It\u2019s a vague memory but my family tried to gay test me as a kid.

I act more \u201cfeminine\u201d and watching \u201cgirly\u201d shows like miraculous or Steven universe and my mom saw that. A few years of this down the road my mom starts acting weird around me, during this time my mom was mad at my sister for dating but never inviting anybody over, the issue was her not knowing who my sister was dating. \n\nJust to avoid future issues so I don\u2019t have to sneak around I ask my mom if I can start trying to date women, the second the word women left my mouth my mom looked like she seen a ghost. Then she started laughing at me. She told me how she assumed I was gay and how from her perspective I 1.randomly stopped talking about women, 2. Act feminine because I don\u2019t know what is considered straight or gay actions because I only grew up around women, 3. I talk way more about my guy friends. The thing is she say my search history before I knew what incognito was, TWICE! So I don\u2019t know how she didn\u2019t know I was 100% straight. We shared a laugh but she told me how she would support me however i turned out. To this day she still slightly suspects me.\n\nSmaller examples my mom used  \n\nWearing towels up to my nipples\n\nCrossing my legs when I sit\n\nWatched My little pony for a year because I\u2019ll want any show with a good opening theme beck then. Im not a Brony \n\nPreferred my stuffed animals over action figures because I liked how soft they were\n\nPlayed with my hair, my hair grows fast thanks to my genetics.\n\nOnly liking soft things which was later found to my related to sensory issues I had \n\nListening more to girly songs\n\nEvery time me getting a girlfriend was brought up I said \u201cI didn\u2019t want a girlfriend\u201d without clarifying i didnt want a boyfriend no excuse for that one, just didn\u2019t want a relationship at the time\n\nUsing slang like \u201cperiod \ud83d\udc85 \u201c for a while because my mom/sister said it a lot\n\nBeing obsessed with Kirby and animal crossing \n\nMinor stuff but that\u2019s what let to her conclusion but I see where she\u2019s coming from \n\nTLDR Mom thought I was gay because I only talked about guys around her and never about women after my first crush flopped",

A few years of this down the road my mom starts acting weird around me, during this time my mom was mad at my sister for dating but never inviting anybody over, the issue was her not knowing who my sister was dating. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just to avoid future issues so I don\u2019t have to sneak around I ask my mom if I can start trying to date women, the second the word women left my mouth my mom looked like she seen a ghost. Then she started laughing at me. She told me how she assumed I was gay and how from her perspective I 1.randomly stopped talking about women, 2. Act feminine because I don\u2019t know what is considered straight or gay actions because I only grew up around women, 3. I talk way more about my guy friends. The thing is she say my search history before I knew what incognito was, TWICE! So I don\u2019t know how she didn\u2019t know I was 100% straight. We shared a laugh but she told me how she would support me however i turned out. To this day she still slightly suspects me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smaller examples my mom used  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wearing towels up to my nipples&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crossing my legs when I sit&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watched My little pony for a year because I\u2019ll want any show with a good opening theme beck then. Im not a Brony &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Preferred my stuffed animals over action figures because I liked how soft they were&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Played with my hair, my hair grows fast thanks to my genetics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only liking soft things which was later found to my related to sensory issues I had &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Listening more to girly songs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time me getting a girlfriend was brought up I said \u201cI didn\u2019t want a girlfriend\u201d without clarifying i didnt want a boyfriend no excuse for that one, just didn\u2019t want a relationship at the time&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using slang like \u201cperiod \ud83d\udc85 \u201c for a while because my mom/sister said it a lot&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being obsessed with Kirby and animal crossing &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minor stuff but that\u2019s what let to her conclusion but I see where she\u2019s coming from &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR Mom thought I was gay because I only talked about guys around her and never about women after my first crush flopped&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

There is also a really big big big big big big problem. I don't know what they look like, sound like, gender. Literally nothing. Now I bet you are asking. \"Hey dumb dumb head how did you even get a crush on this person\". I don't even know man. We kind of talk every day. We text a lot. Play video games together, but for the whole time I have known them for like 2 years. Everyday just seems better when I am texting with them. Now is this probably coming from a place of loneliness. 100%. Do I care. NO. I love being around this person. They are great funny and awesome. Now time for the part where I probably fucked up. We were talking the other day. They sent me a screenshot of a conversation they were having with their other friend. They seemed more energetic then when talking to me. They usually only talk in 3-4 word sentences, or they will send me a wall of text. I love it either way. Back to the story. I kind of felt hurt in a way. I don't know why. So I said something like \"Whoa you text differently their.\" I was met with a response of just \"Yea that just happens when I'm around my friends\". I was like damn. Im not a friend? I then said something about being jealous of those people then. I was then sent a sticker and we sent stickers till She stopped. So yea I'm kind of fucked man. I don't know what to do. Anyone have any advice on what I should do? (Sorry if this was really bad its my first time posting here)\n\nTL;DR: I got a crush on my online friend. They are great. I was sent a screenshot of them talking to their other friends. I made a comment about how she seemed different and that I was a little jealous. Conversation then ended. I'm scared and don't know what to do anymore.",

Literally nothing. Now I bet you are asking. &amp;quot;Hey dumb dumb head how did you even get a crush on this person&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t even know man. We kind of talk every day. We text a lot. Play video games together, but for the whole time I have known them for like 2 years. Everyday just seems better when I am texting with them. Now is this probably coming from a place of loneliness. 100%. Do I care. NO. I love being around this person. They are great funny and awesome. Now time for the part where I probably fucked up. We were talking the other day. They sent me a screenshot of a conversation they were having with their other friend. They seemed more energetic then when talking to me. They usually only talk in 3-4 word sentences, or they will send me a wall of text. I love it either way. Back to the story. I kind of felt hurt in a way. I don&amp;#39;t know why. So I said something like &amp;quot;Whoa you text differently their.&amp;quot; I was met with a response of just &amp;quot;Yea that just happens when I&amp;#39;m around my friends&amp;quot;. I was like damn. Im not a friend? I then said something about being jealous of those people then. I was then sent a sticker and we sent stickers till She stopped. So yea I&amp;#39;m kind of fucked man. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. Anyone have any advice on what I should do? (Sorry if this was really bad its my first time posting here)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I got a crush on my online friend. They are great. I was sent a screenshot of them talking to their other friends. I made a comment about how she seemed different and that I was a little jealous. Conversation then ended. I&amp;#39;m scared and don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "TIFU: Didn't realize how sick my parents dog really was\n\nTrigger warning: the dog dies\n\nSo, this happened last weekend. My parents always have me take care of their 2 horses and 2 dogs when they go on vacation or do a long day trips. I live ~17 minute car ride away (US). It is a burden, but they give me free childcare 3 days a week, so I just accept I'm their go to for all tasks. \n\nA bit of background, my mom was a vet tech before I was born (~34 years ago). We were always raised that pets are family and they deserve the best. This is something I adhere to today as well. My mom doesn't ask my older brother to do help because he follows his wife (no vet/vaccines, no check ups, no spay/neuter). \n\nMy parents brought their dogs to my house Saturday night since they were leaving Sunday morning. I have their 2 dogs (Old= old dog, 15ish + Young= younger dog, 4ish). My two don't really factor into this story. So, Old needs a lot of extra help, she lost a leg to bone cancer last year, she is deaf, needs help going up and down stairs. Young is healthy and has fun playing with my 2 ragamuffin pups.\n\nSunday morning is normal. All 4 dogs eat/play. Sunday afternoon around 2 pm, Young starts acting off. She seems stiff, is off-standish, not with the other dogs. Around 4pm, I start to get concerned and offer Young a dog treat. She doesn't eat it. I call my parents while they are driving to their cabin to tell them she's acting off and describe her symptoms. \n\nMy mom and I agree she has probably eaten one of my 3 year olds toys. I don't know which one. My mom said she's bad about that, I have no idea which toy she could've eaten, but I go about monitoring. \n\nShe gets more off-standish, but is still mobile, drinking water, and pees/poops outside. I continue to update my mom.\n\nNow, this is when it all goes to hell. My younger brother is special needs and is scared to stay the night alone. So I'm at my home with my son and 4 dogs. My husband goes to my parents house to look after my brother and take care of the horses (my brother doesn't want to stay at our house). \n\nI put my 3 year old down around 9pm, Young follows me into his room, so she was mobile at 9pm. Young and I hang on the couch until I'm ready for bed around 10:15pm. Young can no longer stand without assistance. \n\nI call my husband and tell him to get home asap. I call my mom and tell her Young is not doing well. She is understandably upset. I am doing online check in at Emergency vet clinic (closest one is 23 min away) while my husband is coming home to stay with toddler. \n\nMy mom is convinced Young ate a toddler toy  This is incredibly likely. But I always put up toys because one of my dogs will destroy toddler toys too. So it is standard protocol to put away toddler toys every evening and before we leave the house. My mom thinks it happened Saturday night because Young shouldn't have reached that point so quickly.\n\nBefore my husband gets here, Young throws up, starts choking. \n\nI'm on speaker with my parents. I'm following their instructions, doing chest compressions, rescue breaths, checking her mouth. She stopped breathing twice. I was able to get her breathing again once. \n\nShitty story summed up, Young didn't make it. Lots of tears. My parents leave the cabin immediately to come back. I wrap up Young in a towel and blanket and placed her on the guest bed. \n\nIt's been a bit over a week now. My mom 100% blames me. She is still giving us childcare for now, but isn't acknowledging me. We used to be so close. I don't know what to do. I can't fix this. In hindsight, I obviously would've taken her to the vet sooner. I figured I'd just take her to the vet first thing Monday morning if she was still off.\n\nYoung had cancer previously. My grandfather is terrible for dropping his heart/BP pills. I know it was likely me, but maybe it wasn't. Regardless, the dog died on my watch.\n\nI don't know how to open this conversation or how to apologize. I'm just stuck in this crappy loop where I made a poor decision to save a few bucks to avoid the emergency vet. \n\nI'm so frustrated. I moved to this stupid city to be closer to my parents for childcare. I hate the house and town. But it is too expensive to move and now if my parents decide to cut me off because I didn't take their dog to the vet sooner, I don't know how to afford childcare. And I am so screwed.\n\nTL;DR: My parents dog was acting sick (likely ate a toddler toy and was impacted) and died. Now my mom hates me. ",

    "selftext": "******This is my first post, so I apologize for the formatting. I have redone it and split it into paragraphs. I hope this helps.\n\n\nSo this actually happened in May. I had recently left a long term relationship and decided it was time to get back out there. I (31F) downloaded Hinge and matched with a guy (33M) that was very good looking and we hit it off. After a few weeks, I agreed to go on a date with him. We agreed to meet up for a casual coffee date and a walk in the park. \nSo it is time for the date and I show up on time but he is 15 minutes late, I let it go. Of course it\u2019s awkward meeting someone and I had been out of the game for seven years so I wasn\u2019t really sure what I was expecting. \n\nAnyways, he gets out of the car, comes up to me and opens his arm for a hug, and I reciprocate. He then immediately goes in for a kiss with an EXCESSIVE amount of tongue. It caught me off guard, but he was really good looking so I let it go. I figured I was just lame and this is what the cool kids do these days. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \nSo, we get inside this little mom and Pop shop, place our order and it is time to pay, but he just walks away with the drinks. I said out loud \u201cI guess I will pay for them\u201d, he responded with \u201coh if you don\u2019t mind\u201d. I would like to note, I have absolutely no problem paying it just again threw me off because it was never discussed just assumed. Again,I let it go. \n\nWe sit down and start having pretty decent conversation, but he is making very intense eye contact and making audible grunts, which made me a little uncomfortable but not enough to throw any major flags. \n\nSo it is wrapping up and it is time to go to the park. Like a dumbass, I agree to get into the car with a stranger an allow him to drive us there instead of following behind. So we are driving along and he is going the wrong direction to the park. I asked where we were going and he tells me he wanted to take me a mountain lookout. But the specific location he mentioned is known as a place nothing good happens. I veto that. He then tells me he wants me to meet his mother. I say no to that as well. This man pulls up to his mom\u2019s house. I told him in not comfortable with this. He tries to reassure me by mentioning that it\u2019s really his house, his mom just lives with him. \ud83d\ude44 \n\nAt this point, the red flags finally start to make an appearance. I told him that we had agreed to a walk in the park. He reluctantly agreed and headed to the park. He was also swerving all over the road andI swear he fell asleep at least once if not twice. I wanted to just dip out, but I didn\u2019t have my car so I had to ride it out. I convinced him to let me swing by to get my car so it wouldn\u2019t be a hassle later. I should have bailed right then. But nooooo, me being a dumbass, I still follow him to the park. \n\nSo we start walking and this man pulls his shirt off and leaves it off for the remainder of the date. Keep in mind, it\u2019s a public park with a bunch of kids and old people. He wants us to sit on a bench to talk. We sit down. \nY\u2019all, this man starts to pray, LOUD af. \nAbout how grateful he was that I was put into his life and how much he LOVES me and he is in love with me and that I\u2019m his girlfriend. People are walking past us just making eye contact with me as I mouth the words, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d. It was so awkward. \n\nI should probably mention this guy is like 6\u20194\u201d at like 250+lbs. very athletic obviously works out. big enough that I knew I couldn\u2019t take him if I ran. At this point, I was just trying to hurry it along so I could go home. \n\nWe start walking again and he tries to lead me to the edges of the park. The crowd is no longer granny\u2019s and little kids. I\u2019m stepping over needles and around homeless people. There are a bunch of abandoned buildings nearby. He said, \u201cI\u2019ve never been in these buildings at night, wanna check em out with me?\u201d I said,  \u201cNO, I think my mom is calling I need to go home. Thankfully he didn\u2019t push it too far. \nSo he walks me back to my car and as I try to slide in, as I\u2019m swinging my feet under the dash he grabs my left foot (wearing flip flops) and proceeds to put his MOUTH on my toes. \nYall, the gasp I gasped! \nHe notices, let\u2019s go and says, \u201chang on\u201d. He is parallel parked in front of me so I can\u2019t just leave. He digs in his truck for a while and comes back with a jacket. He throws it through my driver window all the way to the back of my SUV. Looks me dead in the eyes, serious af, and says, \u201cjust so you know, I\u2019m very possessive of my belongings, and you are not girlfriend now\u201d. I just looked back and said ok cool. I took tf off. I looked like Lightning McQueen pulling out. \n\nSomething didn\u2019t feel right, so I pull over a few blocks over and grab the jacket. I look in the pocket and there is an Apple Air Tag inside. I threw it in the dumpster at in the parking lot and took the longest way home I could. \n\nDates over, I\u2019m alive! I call my bff and tell her wtf just happened. She was like, \u201cBITCH, did you forget how to google\u201d. I get home, put my FBI cap on and start looking. Tell me why THREE mugshots pop up, drugs, assault, and domestic violence. I also find him in one of those, \u201care we dating the same guy\u201d groups. Yall, his exwife and other past partners had all the receipts. This man is crazy af. He is also in school to be an anesthesiologist! The last person I would want around while I\u2019m unconscious! \n\nI forgot to mention the funniest part! While we headed to the park he pulls out a gift card for Bonefish Grill and says, \u201cthere\u2019s a little over $14 left, do you want to go share an appetizer?\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nTL;DR I went on a date with a psychopath that tried to take me to a secluded mountain top, an abandoned building, and to meet his mom (that he lives with) on a FIRST DATE! It ended with a tracker being placed in my car! ",

She works from home so it\u2019s not like I can just masturbate either.\n\nRecently, she had gone back home to see her family for a few days. I have always been curious on getting one of those 5 lb+ ass with vagina silicon toys as they seemed quite intriguing.\n\nSo, I ordered one of Amazon which said it had discrete packing to use it while she\u2019s away. I used it 3-4 times and then decided it\u2019s too much work to maintain one / also felt some guilt around it so I threw it in the trash before she returned home.\n\nNow this was more than a month ago. The package as promised was indeed in discrete packing and it was discarded successfully.\n\nHowever, today I received a letter in the mail from the Amazon seller soliciting a $25 gift card if I were to leave a review for this 5 lb ass and vagina combo I had ordered (with a photo of it). I know that\u2019s against Amazon seller policies and I could report to seller but the damage is done. My wife checks the mail and she found the letter.\n\nShe shouted calling for me, and confronted me on wtf did I order showing me the paper. I quickly accepted what I had done, and told the full truth along with the fact that I had discarded it.\n\nShe was hurt by it and very angry at me. She asked me to leave the home but I didn\u2019t want to as I said I\u2019m already leaving for a work trip the day after.  I live in a 2 story 4 bedroom home. She packed a bag of my toiletries, towel and sheets and put them outside the room on the floor and commanded me to stay in another room downstairs. I apologized multiple times but she said she doesn\u2019t want to be near me and that she\u2019s disgusted by me.\n\nIn my view I bought myself a sex toy to use at my own private alone time. I\u2019d never think of cheating on her or anything of that sort despite my sexual frustration.\n\nAnyways, now I\u2019m in another room of the home with an angry wife and no idea on how long (if) it might take for her to come around.\n\nTL;DR: Bought a 5lb ass and vagina combo and threw it. Amazon seller sent a letter in mail asking for 5star review a month later that wife found.\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\n** Update 1 (10/28) **: Wow, thanks for everyone\u2019s input I didn\u2019t expect this post to get so many replies but appreciate everyone! So, the times she came out of the room today, she did not look or even speak with me, she was very clear saying \u201cget away from me\u201d whenever I tried to speak or apologize. \n\nBased on the responses here, I did text her because I couldn\u2019t speak to her. The summary of the text is, \u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating this. You were in Vegas, and I bought myself a toy in my private time alone at home, which I even threw away. I\u2019ve never had any sex toys, so I was curious to try one. Why would I tell you something so private about getting myself a toy while you weren\u2019t here? I\u2019m sorry if I upset you, but I shouldn\u2019t be able to masturbate, especially when I\u2019m home alone?\u201d This text was 3 hours ago, still no reply. It seems it\u2019s going to be another night of me and my dog sleeping in another bedroom.\n\n** Update 2 (10/30) **: I returned back from my work trip and she was sitting in the living room watching TV. She didn\u2019t look away the entire time and her back was facing me for the most part.\n\nShe brought some more stuff of mine from the master bathroom to the other that I\u2019ve been using and organized it in the bathroom.\n\nMy dog was excited I was back so I put a collar on her and took her for a walk. When I returned, wife had left the living room. She spoke from a distance only 1 line for the night \u201cthere\u2019s packages for you out front\u201d. And then later she closed the master bedroom door. I checked the packages later, and one was some sweets she had ordered for me before this whole incident. \n\nI sent her a text to simply thank for the sweets that she didn\u2019t reply to. She leaves to visit her family in Vegas again this weekend for ~2 weeks. Hoping we can at least talk like adults over the whole incident prior.",

So in the end, we decided to call the bus company's customer service line in the morning, since if somebody wanted to take the bag, they would've done so already by the time we got back. This morning we checked the ticket and lost and found office in person, since no one picked up the customer service line (because of course), but nevertheless the bag wasn't found.\n\nAnd now the dread just sets in, since I realized that in that bag were most of my clothes, my papers in preparation to graduate, a personal unreplacable gift and basically everything that wasn't my wallet or bus ticket for this month and personal cards (and obviously lost the not so cheap bag itself too which I used for school every day for just a year at this point) which suck of course, but the weed was also there, and a random envelope of gift cards with my father's name and phone number that I forgot about sometime ago.\n\nSo now I'm scared shitless that my father will get in trouble because of my f*ck-up, and my only hope is that whoever the h*ll either doesn't go through the trouble of reporting it, but I doubt it  since I don't know how \"well officer, here's some weed and an envelope with a name in some random school bag I found\" would work... \n\n\nTL;DR\nWent to my friends' place to smoke weed, but on the way back lost the bag with all my stuff in it including the weed, and a gift card envelope with my father's name and number. And I'm scared because using weed is really punishing here if it's reported and traced back ",

Sorry in advance if my English is a bit subpar and hard to interpret.    \nI'm attending trade school and have two classmates who I spend the days with the most. Today, each of us needed things from the store and as I was the one of two of us who had a relatively decent car, it was decided that I was the one to drive us there.    \nGetting to the store went smoothly and so did the ride back, everything good so far, despite me being an inexperienced driver and getting a bit nervous and overly analytical of my driving.    \nThen came the part of arriving at the school parking lot. As I had to reverse back in to the slot I left from, I began positioning the car in what I thought was a good approach. They did not agree.    \nI hadn't even begun to slow down, let alone put the gear in reverse, before they began commenting on and critiquing my positioning. This led to me suddenly being fully aware of my actions and stop driving autonomously, which of course led to me stalling. As if I wasn't getting agitated enough already, the stall got them loudly laughing at my poor attempt at driving.    \nNow I'm starting to fume a bit inside and the anxiousness shot up to the roof. I tried my best to shake it off and keep reverse parking but alas, my attempt was futile. This led me to lose my focus and my attention was redirected towards them and suddenly BAM, I had reversed into the car behind me.    \nLuckily this car belonged to my classmate that was in the car with me; his car is junkier than mine and the damage was just a chip off the clearcoat and he wasn't mad at all about it. But it's an event I won't forget anytime soon and something I now won't hear the end of, as they'll tease me about it until school's over and we part our ways.\n\nTL;DR    \nI stalled my car when reverse parking, then lost focus and reversed into a classmates car.",

Sorry in advance if my English is a bit subpar and hard to interpret.&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;m attending trade school and have two classmates who I spend the days with the most. Today, each of us needed things from the store and as I was the one of two of us who had a relatively decent car, it was decided that I was the one to drive us there.&lt;br/&gt;\nGetting to the store went smoothly and so did the ride back, everything good so far, despite me being an inexperienced driver and getting a bit nervous and overly analytical of my driving.&lt;br/&gt;\nThen came the part of arriving at the school parking lot. As I had to reverse back in to the slot I left from, I began positioning the car in what I thought was a good approach. They did not agree.&lt;br/&gt;\nI hadn&amp;#39;t even begun to slow down, let alone put the gear in reverse, before they began commenting on and critiquing my positioning. This led to me suddenly being fully aware of my actions and stop driving autonomously, which of course led to me stalling. As if I wasn&amp;#39;t getting agitated enough already, the stall got them loudly laughing at my poor attempt at driving.&lt;br/&gt;\nNow I&amp;#39;m starting to fume a bit inside and the anxiousness shot up to the roof. I tried my best to shake it off and keep reverse parking but alas, my attempt was futile. This led me to lose my focus and my attention was redirected towards them and suddenly BAM, I had reversed into the car behind me.&lt;br/&gt;\nLuckily this car belonged to my classmate that was in the car with me; his car is junkier than mine and the damage was just a chip off the clearcoat and he wasn&amp;#39;t mad at all about it. But it&amp;#39;s an event I won&amp;#39;t forget anytime soon and something I now won&amp;#39;t hear the end of, as they&amp;#39;ll tease me about it until school&amp;#39;s over and we part our ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR&lt;br/&gt;\nI stalled my car when reverse parking, then lost focus and reversed into a classmates car.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It was a school day but I was at home for some reason, I cant actually remember why, and the rest of my family had gone to work/school so I had the house to myself, but my dad did tell me at about midday a couple of plumbers were coming over to try and fix our water pressure and that they knew what to do so I could just ignore them which was fine by me. Come midday im lying on the couch scrolling on my phone when the plumbers arrive. And theyre actually mostly tinkering with the hot water box thingy outside, only occasionally coming in to test a tap or something, so its like they arent even there.\n\nNow me, being a hormonal teen, all of a sudden get the urge to, yk, choke the chicken. And I enjoy doing it in big open spaces like my lounge room, it feels kinda freeing in a weird way. Plus I could hear the plumbers outside and the only way they would be able to see me is by looking through the front window, which they have no reason to do because they're out the back, or if they looked through the big glass back doors, which have very loud wooden steps leading up to them, giving me ample warning if one of them decided to come inside. So instead of retreating into the safety of my room I pick my poison and whip my shit out right then and there. Im about a minute deep when I hear footsteps, not from the wooden steps or the front window, but from inside the house. Ive never whipped my head up faster. I feel my heart sink to my stomach as I make direct eye contact with the plumber exiting my laundry room. I somehow didnt hear him at all for the  5 odd minutes he'd been in there and thought he was out tinkering with the box like the other guy. So I lock eyes with this poor plumber for like a full second, meat in hand, video blasting, and then all at once I turn off my phone and try subtly hiding my meat behind the pillows and he just turns and walks out the backdoor, which is right next to the laundry so he was gone quick. \n\nI obviously stopped after that but I was to ashamed to even get up and go to my room so I sat in the exact same position until they left about 20 minutes later. After they left I went and stood where he had been standing to try and gauge how much he saw, and luckily because he was looking at me from over the back of the couch, I think the pillows mostly covered up my weiner, but he definitely heard the video, and he definitely saw the position my arm was in. I still lie awake at night and ponder why I did that dumb shit\n\nTL;DR I masturbated in front of the plumber by accident because I thought he was outside",

I\u2019ve done it when talking about my interests and my brain just cuts me off mid sentence. Any advice? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Instead of saying that a food tasted bad and like children\u2019s saliva after they eat something I said it taste like children on accident and now I feel like garbage. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Then she hits the wrong point and since she was beside me, my knee jumped up and hit her under her right eye.\nThe moment the reflex was triggered I was just merely a bystander, watching me in slow motion knee striking my girlfriends head, while already imagining the court hearing and my sentence for domestic abuse. \nLuckily she has good reflexes and so I \"just\" slightly hit her cheek. After seconds, which felt like an eternity, I controlled myself and checked on her. We applied some frozen bami goreng (we neither had frozen peas nor cool packs) and all was well afterwards.

    "selftext": "I (18F) just wanted to say that I don't regret most of my actions, but it was definitely a fuck up. My sister(16F) got grounded by our mom (50F) because of her grades. Personally, I think it's bullshit because my sister has mostly As and Bs (she used to have worst grades last year, BUT SHE'S LEARNED HER LESSON AFTER GETTING GROUNDED FOR GETTING A D/C). But since my mom expects \"perfection\" VIA all As, my sister got grounded. I don't think it's fair at all - official semester report cards haven't even come out and she's basing my sister's achievements based off of constantly updating grades. I know some of her teachers like to give everyone in their classes 0s on certain assignments to encourage/remind students to do their schoolwork as well (BECAUSE I TOOK THEIR CLASSES!!). It sucks ass, and I think my mom was being to harsh on that.\n\nBack to the story! So, my sister, and her friend (16F), asked me to take them to the library. Since I didn't have anything better to do, I decided to agree to drive them to the library. I got my laptop and then we drove to the library. It was pretty productive. I saw them take notes (well, mostly. I could tell they were messing around a few times) and I was in the corner writing for a personal project. Another friend dropped by, and then they all wanted to go to another friend's place. I mean, I just shrugged and rolled with it. We've been to this friend's place before, so what's the worst that could happen, right?\n\nLong story short, we lost track of time. Our mom noticed and knew that the library was probably closed (closed at 5, we were still out by 6:30) By the time we got home, she was pretty pissed. We both got grounded for the rest of the month and I'm now not allowed to drive anywhere besides school and/or to drop off my sister.\n\nDo I regret it? Not really - I think my mom's reasoning for grounding my sister was unfair. (...Might be because of my own anger at being treated poorly because of the high standards of consistently getting As. I know how much grades are starting to affect my sister because of our mom and typical school pressures. She has a good social life and I don't want her to end up like me.) The most I'm sad about is that since I'm grounded, I can't go out and do club activities and go to social events. Sucks since I'm in college and a commuter, which means I can't really connect with my college as much as I used to, plus all extracurricular activities are at night.\n\nBut sucks to be me, I guess. Even though I don't regret it, I wish I was at least a little more conscious about it.\n\n(Btw there's only one thing I agree with my mom about this whole situation - It was pretty late. My sister does have school tomorrow - I do too, but I have afternoon classes. But other than that, the reason for grounding is something I didn't agree with AND I was there to supervise. Ugh, maybe it's just that late teenage rebellion my mom thinks I have :/)\n\nTLDR: I drove my sister to her friend's place, we lost track of time. Mom got mad and grounded us both. I don't regret it, but it was a fuck up on my part.\n\nEdit: Forgot to put my age in the post...whoops.",

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (18F) just wanted to say that I don&amp;#39;t regret most of my actions, but it was definitely a fuck up. My sister(16F) got grounded by our mom (50F) because of her grades. Personally, I think it&amp;#39;s bullshit because my sister has mostly As and Bs (she used to have worst grades last year, BUT SHE&amp;#39;S LEARNED HER LESSON AFTER GETTING GROUNDED FOR GETTING A D/C). But since my mom expects &amp;quot;perfection&amp;quot; VIA all As, my sister got grounded. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s fair at all - official semester report cards haven&amp;#39;t even come out and she&amp;#39;s basing my sister&amp;#39;s achievements based off of constantly updating grades. I know some of her teachers like to give everyone in their classes 0s on certain assignments to encourage/remind students to do their schoolwork as well (BECAUSE I TOOK THEIR CLASSES!!). It sucks ass, and I think my mom was being to harsh on that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to the story! So, my sister, and her friend (16F), asked me to take them to the library. Since I didn&amp;#39;t have anything better to do, I decided to agree to drive them to the library. I got my laptop and then we drove to the library. It was pretty productive. I saw them take notes (well, mostly. I could tell they were messing around a few times) and I was in the corner writing for a personal project. Another friend dropped by, and then they all wanted to go to another friend&amp;#39;s place. I mean, I just shrugged and rolled with it. We&amp;#39;ve been to this friend&amp;#39;s place before, so what&amp;#39;s the worst that could happen, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, we lost track of time. Our mom noticed and knew that the library was probably closed (closed at 5, we were still out by 6:30) By the time we got home, she was pretty pissed. We both got grounded for the rest of the month and I&amp;#39;m now not allowed to drive anywhere besides school and/or to drop off my sister.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I regret it? Not really - I think my mom&amp;#39;s reasoning for grounding my sister was unfair. (...Might be because of my own anger at being treated poorly because of the high standards of consistently getting As. I know how much grades are starting to affect my sister because of our mom and typical school pressures. She has a good social life and I don&amp;#39;t want her to end up like me.) The most I&amp;#39;m sad about is that since I&amp;#39;m grounded, I can&amp;#39;t go out and do club activities and go to social events. Sucks since I&amp;#39;m in college and a commuter, which means I can&amp;#39;t really connect with my college as much as I used to, plus all extracurricular activities are at night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But sucks to be me, I guess. Even though I don&amp;#39;t regret it, I wish I was at least a little more conscious about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Btw there&amp;#39;s only one thing I agree with my mom about this whole situation - It was pretty late. My sister does have school tomorrow - I do too, but I have afternoon classes. But other than that, the reason for grounding is something I didn&amp;#39;t agree with AND I was there to supervise. Ugh, maybe it&amp;#39;s just that late teenage rebellion my mom thinks I have :/)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I drove my sister to her friend&amp;#39;s place, we lost track of time. Mom got mad and grounded us both. I don&amp;#39;t regret it, but it was a fuck up on my part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Forgot to put my age in the post...whoops.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "Obligatory \"Didn't happen today.\"\n\nWhen I was 19 and attending my hometown's junior (2-year) college, I became good friends with two non-traditional students, Ann and Hillary, in a class we shared. They were in their early-mid 30s. We stayed friends after our shared class ended, occasionally catching up at the same restaurant where we'd eat after class.\n\nAnn was a bit eccentric but a sweetheart. She'd invite me on trips with her daughters, who were roughly ages 11 and 13. Wanting me to \"see more of the country,\" she invited me to her sister's out-of-state wedding, when her husband couldn't go and wouldn't take their girls out of school in January (important later).\n\nI moved on to attend university, but a couple years after college graduation, I moved back to my hometown to work at the newspaper. Hillary had moved, but Ann and I caught up at our old regular restaurant. I took some senior portraits for her oldest daughter who was now graduating high school, and after that, we kinda drifted.\n\nWorking at the local newspaper means seeing **all** the courthouse records published in the paper. And when Ann's youngest daughter was **just 18** , I saw her in the list of new marriage licenses! Ann's daughter Lucy had pretty standard first and middle names. But back when the girls were little on one of those daytrips, they talked about how, after giving birth, Ann was so out of it, her husband misspelled Lucy's middle name accidentally or otherwise on the birth certificate. \n\nSo seeing Lucy's name in the recent marriage licenses was solid, could-not-be-mistaken for someone else with that name proof ... And to be honest, Ann was known to fib to make some stories sound cooler, so it was also kinda proof that Lucy's name story was not one of those fibs.\n\nWell what do you do when an old friend whose kids you knew as littles has a kid GETTING MARRIED? You message her, \"Looks like congrats are in order, Mother of the bride!\" With a bunch of smiley faces.\n\nA confused? Ann responded that both her girls were single! She said she'd pass along my congrats to her brother, who was married that week. Back when I was Ann's plus-one at her sister's wedding, I'd met her parents and all her siblings, so she thought (or hoped) I just meant him.\n\nMeanwhile MY brain immediately started saying, \"fuck, fuck, fuck fuck fuuuuuuck.\" It's so crystal clear with 20/20 hindsight that this was a land mine ... Lucy was **barely 18.** At the time, yeah girl was young, but I had classmates who got married at 18. It never occured to me LUCY GOT MARRIED BEHIND HER PARENTS' BACKS. IN SECRET. And it apparently didn't occur to Romeo and Juliet that modern marriages are published in the local paper. \n\nI couldn't lie and say I had the wrong Lucy, again with the middle name thing. So I just told Ann how odd it was a Lucy Middlename Lastname, of the same age, was in this week's marriage licenses. Ann responded, \"wishful thinking on the boy's part. Lucy told him no.\"\n\nI let Ann have it and just said, \"Ahh.\" Knowing, There. Is. No. Way. a boy, man, woman or anyone can file for and receive a whole ass marriage license with the other party in absentia. That's not how it works. But poor Ann now had bigger worries and I wasn't about to call her out even more. \n\nLater Lucy herself messaged the newspaper social media accounts asking if we could unpublish the marriage license, as there'd been a mistake and it was no longer relevant. She didn't try and say she'd *rejected* it altogether like her mom did. Nor did she argue the accuracy or anything ... So I knew Ann trying to save face was just that, and Lucy did, in fact, sign a marriage license at some point. The newspaper did not, ever, remove public records, including this time. \n\nI never heard what happened to Lucy and Romeo, whether they'd already broken up by the time the record was published or made to by their parents, or something else? I sure as shit wasn't going to ask. I do know they did not stay married.\n\nAnn sent me some copy/paste \"pass this on\" thing at some point, and I gave her a salon suggestion in response to a post, but we never had a full conversation again. Some time later I noticed a blue, \"Add Friend\" button by her name. It would have been cool to keep in touch on social media but knowing we'd all but drifted, and coupled with that mortifying (for us both) exchange, the friendship was probably meant to fade. \n\nTL;DR: I knew the young daughters of an old college friend who was a little older than me. Years later I moved back to town and when I saw the youngest daughter's name in the newspaper's marriage licenses, I congratulated my friend on being a \"mother of the bride,\" only to find she had no idea her 18-year-old daughter applied for a marriage license ... and her daughter didn't realize public records were published in the newspape",

We\u2019re present at all practices and games so the online chat which is mostly score updates and highlights doesn\u2019t really interest us as we\u2019re there for it. Last season some\nof the parents were as cliquey as players can be so nothing was specifically directed our way regardless. I don\u2019t mess with WhatsApp at all myself and this is the only group I\u2019m in. I\u2019m the more extroverted of the two of us so I\u2019ll comment once in a while or update on my daughter\u2019s availability for this session or that. \n\nThe first game of the season was last night so again being there I didn\u2019t need to check the goal video. I recorded it myself from a superior angle as the rest of the parents were at field level and I was viewing from a balcony. \n\nTldr: The new soccer season for my 15 year old daughter started officially this week and my wife was added to the group after me in view of dozens of other parents. How her name appears in my phone contacts got shared automatically. \n\n\u201cSo-and-so added Abigail Tittz to the group.\u201d\n\nI checked with the coach and he was dying because it is visible for all apparently.

We have so much in common: we like the same music, have read the same books, and share similar tastes in shows and movies. We even agree on most opinions about them. We clicked very quickly and started chatting on Instagram about a week after meeting. A month later, we exchanged numbers.\n\nI started feeling more infatuated with Josh when he began giving me little gifts, like chocolate bars and truffles. Once, when we were discussing our favorite superheroes, he mentioned his was Superman, and I said I loved Spiderman. For his birthday in May, I gifted him a Superman keychain\u2014a small gesture, just so he wouldn\u2019t feel unnoticed. Then, on my birthday in June, he surprised me with Spiderman socks (which were adorable). By then, I was completely smitten.\n\nJosh is charming, with curly, long hair, a cute goatee, and a fit physique from working out. He\u2019s also respectful, kind, hardworking, has a smooth voice, and a genuinely pretty smile. Not surprisingly, almost everyone at work has fallen for him at some point. Some people still are, though he doesn\u2019t pay it much attention.\n\nAs we got closer, he confided in me that he\u2019s bi\u2014something nobody else knows. He also opened up about his best friend, \"Ben\" (25M), whom he once was in love with. I suspect he still has feelings for Ben, though he denies it. Ben doesn\u2019t seem like the best friend, though; he doesn\u2019t work (he gets an allowance from his parents), lives with his grandma, and spends his money on partying and video games. He\u2019s often disrespectful, frequently making inappropriate comments about women\u2019s bodies and how he gets \"horny\" for them. When Ben is struggling mentally (he has anxiety), he either demands Josh\u2019s attention or ghosts him for months. But when Josh is going through something, Ben just says he \"can\u2019t stop his life to take care of him.\"\n\nJosh clearly holds some resentment toward Ben, especially since, after rejecting Josh\u2019s confession of love four years ago, Ben began using him as an ego boost, constantly reminding Josh that if he (Ben) wanted something more, Josh would \u201ccrawl back to him\u201d.\n\nLast month, I got tired of holding onto this little crush and decided to tell Josh how I felt. I figured that if he felt the same way, great; if not, I could finally move on. I told him over text since we rarely have privacy at work. I admitted that I liked him and wanted to tell him before my feelings grew out of control. His response was honest\u2014he said he\u2019s very confused and is almost certain he\u2019s gay. If he is, he said he wouldn\u2019t want to hurt me while figuring that out. So, I decided to move on, and we agreed to stay friends.\n\nThe challenge is that Josh is my only friend in a very hostile work environment, so we\u2019re always together. I worry that my feelings are evolving from a simple crush into something deeper.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, I\u2019m starting to feel some resentment toward him. Recently, he started talking about a girl from his gym he\u2019s interested in, even wanting to buy her an expensive box of chocolates for her birthday. Ironically, this girl is currently seeing his best friend, Ben, and now he likes and resent both of them.\n\nNow, people at work are starting to think that Josh and I are seeing each other; they gossip among themselves and give us suggestive looks when we\u2019re together. These looks put us both in a very awkward position.\n\nSo, Reddit, what should I do? Should I work on getting over it? Should I distance myself and try to move on?\n\nI don\u2019t blame him for being confused about his sexuality\u2014I am too, sometimes\u2014but this situation is starting to affect my self-esteem. Thank you all for reading.\n\nTL;DR: I have feelings for my confused friend, but now I\u2019m starting to resent him for liking other girls instead of me.\n\n",

For decades, at this point, I have been telling myself (silently most times) that \"I'm going to unalive you\" to thoughts that won't leave my brain. \n\nIt's always directed at things I'm privately embarrassed about and never a person that's not myself. For example random time when I got pranked in middle school to make it look like i peed myself that just won't go away? \"I'm going to unalive you.\"  That time I sneezed so hard I sharted in the middle of talking to a girl I was crushing on and her friend who witnessed the whole thing told everybody about i? \"I'm going to unalive you.\" \n\nWell today my lovely concoction of horribly put together thought meat decided to allow my partner (35 F), whom I've been with for 8 years to finally stumble upon my weird habit, that I've been keeping locked up tighter than Fort fucking Knox, in the worst possible timing. \n\nEarlier, we got into an argument (it was my fault). Hours later, after the argument was resolved and going to a friend's housewarming party, we get home sometime after midnight and we talked about things. It was a GOOD conversation and I genuinely can't stress that enough. Another important detail is that I have long hair and regularly keep it in a bun more on that soon. We wrap up our convo, I take the dogs out for the night, and I fell asleep on the couch scrolling through my phone, an often occurrence. I decided to head to bed. I was struggling with getting my hair tie out in the darkness of a room at 6 am, when the thought of my friend asking me to demonstrate a kick I learned in taekwondo and everybody in visible range laughed at me. But instead of staying in a thought bubble, like it normally does, it comes out of my mouth... with her... in bed... 5 feet away from me... next to our dresser where we keep a \ud83d\udd2b for home defense. She snaps awake, obviously uncomfortable and asks me what I said. I explained to her why I do that but something that weird is just plain unbelievable so I'm sitting here flipping between freaking out and looking like I'm something I'm not whilst trying to figure out how to un-fuck this situation.\n\n\nTL;DR My partner just found out that I tell my brain that I'm going to inflict harm on embarrassing memories at 6 AM and thinks I was threatening her",

For example random time when I got pranked in middle school to make it look like i peed myself that just won&amp;#39;t go away? &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to unalive you.&amp;quot;  That time I sneezed so hard I sharted in the middle of talking to a girl I was crushing on and her friend who witnessed the whole thing told everybody about i? &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to unalive you.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well today my lovely concoction of horribly put together thought meat decided to allow my partner (35 F), whom I&amp;#39;ve been with for 8 years to finally stumble upon my weird habit, that I&amp;#39;ve been keeping locked up tighter than Fort fucking Knox, in the worst possible timing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier, we got into an argument (it was my fault). Hours later, after the argument was resolved and going to a friend&amp;#39;s housewarming party, we get home sometime after midnight and we talked about things. It was a GOOD conversation and I genuinely can&amp;#39;t stress that enough. Another important detail is that I have long hair and regularly keep it in a bun more on that soon. We wrap up our convo, I take the dogs out for the night, and I fell asleep on the couch scrolling through my phone, an often occurrence. I decided to head to bed. I was struggling with getting my hair tie out in the darkness of a room at 6 am, when the thought of my friend asking me to demonstrate a kick I learned in taekwondo and everybody in visible range laughed at me. But instead of staying in a thought bubble, like it normally does, it comes out of my mouth... with her... in bed... 5 feet away from me... next to our dresser where we keep a \ud83d\udd2b for home defense. She snaps awake, obviously uncomfortable and asks me what I said. I explained to her why I do that but something that weird is just plain unbelievable so I&amp;#39;m sitting here flipping between freaking out and looking like I&amp;#39;m something I&amp;#39;m not whilst trying to figure out how to un-fuck this situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR My partner just found out that I tell my brain that I&amp;#39;m going to inflict harm on embarrassing memories at 6 AM and thinks I was threatening her&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It's, like, 30 steps round trip.\n\nWell, I overthink everything. I set it on their porch in front of the gate that goes across their steps, and went to walk away. Then, I was like, \"oh, but I'm not sure if they're actually home right now, so what if they go to leave the house and knock it down the stairs with the gate? That wouldn't be very fun and I'd feel awful if whatever's in the box is broken...\"\n\nSo I picked it up and moved it to the other side of the gate. But then I realized it was getting dark, and I didn't want them to open the gate and trip over it, so I picked it back up. I want to avoid bothering them, so coming back later when I see (or hear, because she's a borky girl) the dog let out is absolutely out of the question. At this point, I'm just holding the package and walking up to the porch and stepping back to try and gauge where the streetlight would hit their porch when it kicks on, and I eventually settle on a good spot and half run home bc thank goodness nobody's ever going to see this! \n\nWell, after asking what the neighbor meant by that, she explained that it was really funny to see me just basically walking in circles, especially if you speed the footage up a bit. She showed me the footage. I do, in fact, look like an idiot, but it is, in fact, kind of hilarious. At one point, it even kind of looks like I'm waltzing with the box.\n\ntl;dr I tried to do something nice by returning a misdelivered package, ended up looking like an idiot, and may or may not end up in a TikTok with the Benny Hill theme song playing while I goofily stumble around trying to figure out where to put a box on a porch.\n\nediting to add a couple things: First of all, I don't have the footage. My neighbor showed it to me on her phone. I didn't tell her not to post it anywhere, but my face also doesn't hide what I'm feeling so I'm pretty sure she could see that i wasn't comfortable with the whole thing. Second (due to pressure from random people in the comments), I've written her a note to see if she does plan on uploading it anywhere. If she does end up posting it, I'll add the link to this post, but as for right now I'm keeping my physical self off of Reddit as I do enjoy the fact that nobody here knows what I look like.\n\nJust another edit bc someone dmed me that this is \"definitely going to end up in a Smosh video\": Hello, Shayne/Dad!

We got into a minigame called \"Crank to Rank\", where the goal of each player was to \"turn the crank\" by shaking the wii remote at a rapid pace.\n\nWe both started the game, it was just us as the other 2 players were CPUs, and when it comes to shaking a wii remote, I really have to say that my gf went on, in her own words, a rampage. She shook her controller up and down like a lightning blur, and ended up winning easily.\n\nI was a little... precarious at the time. Especially after not seeing her for so long at that point. After she won from shaking her controller so hard, I saw this as prowess from a side of her that I've never seen. The thought rushed to my head, and I acted on impulse. I immediately turned to her and said, \"You wanna pause the game real quick?\". She looked back at me, and seemed somewhat confused. I don't think she really got the idea at this point.\n\nI decided to just take the assumption that she didn't get the idea and just say it bluntly. I mentioned to her how impressed I was that she shook her controller to turn the crank as quickly as she did. I then asked her if she could do the same thing to, well, my crank.\n\nAfter this, she stared at me awkwardly, I could tell she ended up being very offended by that, as if I bluntly insulted her or something. A few seconds into that moment is when I realized \"Oh, shoot--\". She got up from her seat, and looked at me distressed. All she said at that moment was \"What is wrong with you?\" and left to go back home, without talking to me. I was too anxious at that time to say anything in response.\n\nI messaged her later that night, hoping to resolve this incident, but she never did end up reading any of my messages. I hope I can end up apologizing for what I said.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Got horny from a motion controls mario party game that my gf won and scared her off.",

It's been bothering me for a while so I was okay with that, since I have been wanting to fix the issue. She asked me to put on a gown like a robe so I can cover up and not be exposed.\nAt this clinic they use a chaperone (someone else to be in the room with the doctor)\nThe doctor walked out so I could undress and put on the gown. Also, to go get a chaperone.\nThe doctor comes back in and asks me to use the gown as a \"curtain\" to shield my area from the chaperone. \nThe chaperone was a young female in her 20s. She stood right next to the doctor but at an angle where I wouldn't be exposed but she could still see that everything is okay.\nAs I was showing the doctor, the doctor asked exactly where I felt the irritation.\nI completely let go of the gown and started tossing my junk around showing her the irritation at the base of my penis on the right side. Then I face where the chaperone is standing and show her the left side too. \nI got so caught up in the moment I forgot there was a chaperone in the room. I don't think she was meant to be a part of all that. I don't know what she saw but I felt so embarassed after because she came in later to give me my prescription and looked red faced.\n\n\nTL;DR\nI was getting my groin area checked out for irritated skin. The doctor brought in a young female chaperone that was not supposed to see anything. I got so carried away showing the problem areas I forgot to cover up. I am almost certain the chaperone saw me tossing my junk around everywhere.",

It&amp;#39;s been bothering me for a while so I was okay with that, since I have been wanting to fix the issue. She asked me to put on a gown like a robe so I can cover up and not be exposed.\nAt this clinic they use a chaperone (someone else to be in the room with the doctor)\nThe doctor walked out so I could undress and put on the gown. Also, to go get a chaperone.\nThe doctor comes back in and asks me to use the gown as a &amp;quot;curtain&amp;quot; to shield my area from the chaperone. \nThe chaperone was a young female in her 20s. She stood right next to the doctor but at an angle where I wouldn&amp;#39;t be exposed but she could still see that everything is okay.\nAs I was showing the doctor, the doctor asked exactly where I felt the irritation.\nI completely let go of the gown and started tossing my junk around showing her the irritation at the base of my penis on the right side. Then I face where the chaperone is standing and show her the left side too. \nI got so caught up in the moment I forgot there was a chaperone in the room. I don&amp;#39;t think she was meant to be a part of all that. I don&amp;#39;t know what she saw but I felt so embarassed after because she came in later to give me my prescription and looked red faced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR\nI was getting my groin area checked out for irritated skin. The doctor brought in a young female chaperone that was not supposed to see anything. I got so carried away showing the problem areas I forgot to cover up. I am almost certain the chaperone saw me tossing my junk around everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I reached out and he ended up apologising about what happened, said he should have said something when I puked but he had a bit of a knee-jerk reaction. He was a bit afraid to reach out because he thought he pushed me into doing something I was uncomfortable with and that\u2018s why I ran off. I explained I was mostly embarrassed although what he did was a bit too aggressive for my first time. He was sorry for that too, said he had a bit too much to drink as well and wasn\u2019t being considerate. He offered to make it up to me by taking me out to dinner and having a proper date.\n\nStory:\n\nI met a guy last night at the grocery store while I was buying a bottle of wine for a party. My costume had no pockets so I forgot to bring ID with me. The cashier was being difficult and wouldn\u2019t let me buy it so I just left.\n\nThe guy behind me in line bought the wine and chased after me to handed it off to me. He complimented my choice and chatted with me while I headed over to my friend\u2018s place. He was hitting on me pretty hard - asking me if I had a boyfriend, etc., I was using my boy voice the whole time but since I was fully made up and dressed like Velma from Scooby-Doo, I told him I was trans to be sure but he could already tell. I found him very fun and charming, so I let him have my number when we parted ways and he asked for it.\n\nI meet up with my friends, and we have a few drinks before heading to the party. I had been really excited about this because it was a genderbent party. I\u2019m in the closet and boymode most of the time to avoid my parents finding out via social media, so having a chance to be fem presenting without anyone finding out was pretty awesome for me.\n\nThe party was a big university event and we had to queue to get inside. Unfortunately we arrived too late and couldn\u2019t get in. We queued for a bit on the off chance there was extra capacity, but eventually gave up and headed to another club. There were three of us, and one friend ended up running off with a girl he met. When my other friend left for the washroom a guy started grinding up on me while I was dancing. I was a bit tipsy and my favourite song was on so I leaned into it. Unfortunately he got a bit handsy and clocked that I had boy parts. He backed off immediately and shouted \u201cWTF\u201d - and I just ran out of the club without looking back.\n\nThis was quickly turning into the worst night of my life. The guy from the grocery store had been texting me, and we had a bit of a back and forth all night, especially when I was queuing. He bragged a lot about his wine collection and invited me over. At this point I was ready to head home, but I lived on the other side of town and really needed to pee. I didn\u2019t really want to head into a public men\u2019s bathroom dressed as sexy Velma, so I figured I would stop for one drink, use his toilet, and head home.\n\nI stopped by his place, fully transparent I am only doing this for a bio break. We had one drink, but we started talking about ourselves and I felt myself really opening up to him. So I stayed for another. He was really sweet, understanding, and mature. I also clued in that I had met him before because I came to his cafe several months ago. He was flirty back then too.\n\nI told him some really personal stuff and cried a little bit. He hugged me and we cuddled on the couch for a bit before he finally kissed me. Things got pretty heated, and I got a bit testy when he touched my boy parts - I explained to him it was connected to a traumatic experience I told him about and it really triggers me. He backed off, but I could still see that he had a raging hard on.\n\nI really liked him and I didn\u2019t want to leave him unsatisfied or make it seem like I didn\u2019t want him so I got down on my knees to give him head. It was actually the first time I ever did something like this so I was terrible. My teeth kept getting in the way and I could hear him get frustrated.\n\nI told him I was sorry and this was my first time but I really wanted him to feel good, so he sighed and told me to stick out my tongue. He then grabbed me by the head and started throat fucking me. I was gagging a lot but I could tell he enjoyed it so I let him keep going.\n\nBut when he came it was too much, there was a huge wave of nausea and I projectile vomited all over his lap. We\u2019d been eating snacks the whole time so it was a lot, it got all over his junk, his clothes, and sofa. He ran off to the bathroom to wash himself off immediately, and I felt so embarrassed I just left home while he was in there without saying a word.\n\nI really liked him, but I feel like I ruined everything. I don\u2019t know what I should even do at this point. Should I text him sorry for leaving him with a giant pile of puke? Should I just forget this whole sorry episode and move on? It was cathartic to write this out at least. I feel a bit less humiliated, thanks for listening.\n\nTLDR; I gave head for the first time to a guy I really like and ended up throwing up all over him then running away.",

It's really fancy and has a kitchenette area with cheap laminate countertops. Last night, I was trying to super glue the headpiece I had for the costume to something that would make it stick better on my head. I left it on the countertop and ended up getting some super glue on the countertop. I thought, \"oh no that's not good\" and looked up how to get super glue off of countertops after scrubbing it with soap and water did nothing. One website said to scrape at it with a non-serated knife under a layer of paper towels so as to not ruin the countertop. I don't have any real knives in my dorm so I used a pair of scissors instead which definitely was a horrible idea because I couldn't get them exactly flat against the countertop, and the very tip of the scissors would have more pressure than the rest of them. I began scraping and heard some scraping noises and thought that that was the super glue coming off. I was so wrong. While I did get some of the super glue off, I wasn't able to get a sizable amount removed and worse I had scratched the hell out of these countertops. I started panicking and then tried looking up how to get scratches out of countertops. I saw somewhere that baking soda paste can be used to help scratches on countertops, and that was also one of the solutions to the super glue problem. Perfect, I'll just go to the store and buy baking soda and kill two birds with one stone. Except when I used the baking soda, nothing happened. Or at least any changes were so minimal that I couldn't tell a difference. Currently the countertop still has a bunch of little white scratches in one compact area that the other 3 girls I live with all said they couldn't notice. I pointed out the spot to my suitemate and she said \"well that's definitely not ideal\" so it's definitely not unnoticeable once it's been brought to attention. I tried to look at more options, but whenever I see someone ask a similar question of how to get scratches out of laminate countertops the responses are basically \"you're fucked lol.\" \nI don't know how to fix this on a budget, I don't even think I can anymore. I don't know if I should try to get someone to come and fix it or just take the L and whatever fine they give me at the end of the year for ruining the counter. How much money can I be fined for this? Are they gonna try to charge me for a whole new counter top? Any advice of what to do or who to talk to would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTldr: I got super glue and scratches on the countertop in my dorm and don't know what to do.",

I have a GSD dog and they have a small dog and a large dog, breed I am unsure of maybe some kind of pit bull or terrier or something I'm not sure. The entire family sucks with dogs, and the little one has shot out and circled around me and my dog multiple times before, but nothing has happened.\n\n Fast forward to last Thursday morning (2 days ago) I was 10 feet from my door against the wall that lines all the apartments. As I pass their door, I see their large dog shoot out (they were unloading groceries) and come at my dog, they growl and tussle, and then he darts back inside when two woman yelled at him. They apologized and i checked my dog and didn't see anything, so I continued with my life. A little later i see blood pooling on her chest. I clean the wound and it visibly looks like a dog bite. I tried to contact them about their dogs rabies/vaccine status, and  they weren't home. \n\nUnfortunately, my ring camera unpaired from my wifi since it went down after the recent hurricane in  florida and we haven't re paired it, and none of my neighbors cameras got the incident. So im stuck with no proof and I'm pretty upset at this point because of this whole ordeal.\n\nThis is where I fuck up big time, I'm throwing some trash out and see one of the women that was there and a boy who i know live in the apartment in question, and my emotions got the absolute best of me. I called her out and told her that her dog bit mine, and that this is unacceptable and I expect her to cover vet costs. she starts denying it and I (VERY STUPIDLY) tell her that I do have proof, she requests to see the proof, I deny it. She starts saying her dog just wanted to play, and that set me off completely, i started name calling, calling her the R word, saying she must be stupid and that her dog hurt mine and i don't play around about that. \n\nWe went back into our apartments all upset, and the regret and realization has just kicked in that i made this situation a billion times worse for everyone involved and I am just such a moron. I really want to apologize but I am afraid of going over there because i don't want them to think i am going to continue arguing, I just want both of out dogs to be ok and healthy I don't care about anything else.\n\nI wanted to post this just to calm down and to also ask for advice, and before you comment, yes I know I am a complete idiot and an asshole for blowing up like that without even having evidence that it happened.\n\nTLDR: My neighbor's dog bit mine, I tried contacting them and no one was home, so when I saw them today, I went totally bonkers (verbally) and crashed out when we could have handled it calmly.

So I was very very tired, and honestly, I think I was kinda out of my mind.\n\nI was walking down the hall to get home, and the view outside the window was so beautiful. The sun was setting. But I couldn't fully see the view because of the iron railing on the window. \n\nI looked around and there was no one there, so I tuck my head into the railing and enjoyed the sunset for a moment.

This literally happened a few hours ago. I was masturbating in my room when my gf walked in. We have an open policy when it comes to masturbating. If sex with each other is not an option for whatever reason, then getting off on your own is totally acceptable, regardless if the other person is present. My gf approached me while I was masturbating, which I thought was gonna lead to her helping me out in some way, but she just wanted to see what kind of porn I was watching on my phone.\n\nI was on the cusp of climaxing when my gf casually mentioned that the young porn star I was watching was no longer alive and apparently her death was directly related to her experience in the porn industry. My orgasm instantly fizzled out when I was about to cum, which caused my dick to fucking spasm like I was ejaculating, even though I was not. It looked and felt like I was shooting blanks because technically I was. All I could do was accept defeat and hopelessly stare at my dick twitching repeatedly until it gradually deflated. I thanked my gf for totally killing my orgasm. She shrugged and said at least my orgasm was the only thing that died, unlike the poor girl I almost got off to. \n\nLesson learned: stop masturbating in front of my gf unless I am 100% sure no dead people are involved. \n\nTL:DR Masturbated in front of my gf, which I thought was gonna lead to her helping me out, but instead she commented on the porn I was watching and made me aware that one of the actors in the video had died, which instantly killed my orgasm and left me feeling disappointed in my life choices, specifically my decision to masturbate in front of my gf.\n",

This literally happened a few hours ago. I was masturbating in my room when my gf walked in. We have an open policy when it comes to masturbating. If sex with each other is not an option for whatever reason, then getting off on your own is totally acceptable, regardless if the other person is present. My gf approached me while I was masturbating, which I thought was gonna lead to her helping me out in some way, but she just wanted to see what kind of porn I was watching on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was on the cusp of climaxing when my gf casually mentioned that the young porn star I was watching was no longer alive and apparently her death was directly related to her experience in the porn industry. My orgasm instantly fizzled out when I was about to cum, which caused my dick to fucking spasm like I was ejaculating, even though I was not. It looked and felt like I was shooting blanks because technically I was. All I could do was accept defeat and hopelessly stare at my dick twitching repeatedly until it gradually deflated. I thanked my gf for totally killing my orgasm. She shrugged and said at least my orgasm was the only thing that died, unlike the poor girl I almost got off to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lesson learned: stop masturbating in front of my gf unless I am 100% sure no dead people are involved. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR Masturbated in front of my gf, which I thought was gonna lead to her helping me out, but instead she commented on the porn I was watching and made me aware that one of the actors in the video had died, which instantly killed my orgasm and left me feeling disappointed in my life choices, specifically my decision to masturbate in front of my gf.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "EDIT: Well alright\u2026 not the way I thought this post was going to go. Some people were apparently very mad about this post? Which, sorry if you feel that way. I thought it was a funny story which people would enjoy. But those that did enjoy it like I intended are being downvoted into oblivion. So yikes. Moving the TLDR to the top, because I stated everything in that for this story to be avoided for those who so badly did not want to read. Might delete this post if the negativity keeps up\u2026 was really not the goal. Guess my real fuckup was posting this story to reddit thinking it would make people laugh. \n\nFor anyone who cares: my ultimate goal was I thought this was a funny story that people would enjoy as much as we did. The fact that it didn\u2019t turn out that way sucks a little, then again I knew reddit could be harsh. I thought this could\u2019ve been a nice breather from the unending negative ones. \n\n\u2026..\n\nTLDR; don\u2019t skinny dip kids. Husband &amp; I locked ourselves out of a cabin &amp; I was stark naked. Thankfully we managed to find one unlocked door.\n\n\nMaybe NSFW? Involves nudity but nothing really explicit is described.\n\nAnyway\u2026 Basically\u2026 the title\u2026 but let me explain. \n\nSo my husband (34M) and myself (27F) got married earlier this year and went on our honeymoon shortly after. We have quite a few financially taxing plans coming up in the next few months so we decided to take a short honeymoon to a cabin on a lake.\n\nIt was absolutely beautiful and we would love to have another stay here again. Our favorite parts about this trip are the fact that it was on a lake, had a barbeque and firepit as well as a hot tub on an outside deck with an overview of the lake. Little did I know this trip would\u2019ve been memorable for a completely other reason\u2026\n\nSo, it\u2019s our honeymoon. There\u2019s a hottub. Yes, I wanted to relax without the restrictions of a bathing suit and it was very freeing and exhilarating. I loved it.\n\nOn our last day I went ahead and popped in the tub. My husband was grabbing some spare towels and followed me out afterwards shutting the door behind him. The house was old so it shifted a little weird after it was closed so my husband just tugged gently and tried to make sure it was fully closed. All of a sudden\u2026 this is what he says:\n\nHubs: \u201cBabe??? Did you lock the door?\u201d\nMe: \u201cNo?\u201d\n\nHusband continued jiggling the doorknob and looked at me like a deer in headlights. The door appeared to be locked. \n\nAt first, I thought he was joking. Now my husband is rather silly, he is the funniest person I know in my life and he is the kind that likes to prank me, of course it\u2019s all in good fun. But this made me skeptical of being gullible. I thought this was one of those moments.\n\nI told him that\u2019s hilarious and to open the door and come get naked in the tub with me (he had his swim trunks on where I left my swimwear inside). He didn\u2019t let up. He told me he wasn\u2019t joking and that the door was really locked and he had no clue how. For a solid 2 minutes I didn\u2019t believe him until he was maniacally pulling and pushing and twisting on the door knob in exaggerated motions demanding he was not joking.\n\nMy stomach sank and I felt my eyes get the same deer in headlights look. Here we were, in an AirBNB cabin in the middle of nowhere, with our cellphones locked inside and me wearing my birthday suit. I felt like a little child where my parents just spanked me and started inwardly panicking. I kept picturing scenarios in my head where the only option we had would be to pad barefooted wearing nothing but a damn towel to the next door neighbors cabin half a mile down and hope that someone was there to be able to call for help. \n\nI jumped out of the tub and wrapped myself in a towel when I remembered: we left the cabin earlier to grab some food and came back and my husband forgot his phone in the car. His ankle was injured at the time and the walk to the car while not too far was still enough that I offered to get it for him so he wouldn\u2019t be hobbling on his hurt foot much longer. I have a habit of locking doors once we get inside (how we managed to get into this predicament)\u2026 but I didn\u2019t remember locking the front door after grabbing his phone because I went to hand it to him immediately. \n\nI prayed that door was open, prayed that I hadn\u2019t locked the front door and wouldn\u2019t have to be naked except a towel in the middle of nowhere to walk to a strangers house. Of course, I still had to check to make sure he wasn\u2019t messing with me and turns out the door really was locked. (Yes, I still doubted him, he is a big trickster sometimes.) He stared at me with a bewildered look on his face before shouting sarcastically \u201cYES. IT\u2019S REALLY LOCKED!\u201d (In a humorous way, he never really gets mad, the only feelings we felt at that moment was a mix of hilarious hysteria and panic in this situation)\n\nI went around the deck to the front door (it wrapped around the house) and held my breath as I turned the knob. The door\u2026 opened. \n\nI could breathe again. I waddled my naked butt inside and shut the front door, locking it behind me, and walked to the back door leading to the hottub to unlock it.

Some people were apparently very mad about this post? Which, sorry if you feel that way. I thought it was a funny story which people would enjoy. But those that did enjoy it like I intended are being downvoted into oblivion. So yikes. Moving the TLDR to the top, because I stated everything in that for this story to be avoided for those who so badly did not want to read. Might delete this post if the negativity keeps up\u2026 was really not the goal. Guess my real fuckup was posting this story to reddit thinking it would make people laugh. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For anyone who cares: my ultimate goal was I thought this was a funny story that people would enjoy as much as we did. The fact that it didn\u2019t turn out that way sucks a little, then again I knew reddit could be harsh. I thought this could\u2019ve been a nice breather from the unending negative ones. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2026..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR; don\u2019t skinny dip kids. Husband &amp;amp; I locked ourselves out of a cabin &amp;amp; I was stark naked. Thankfully we managed to find one unlocked door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe NSFW? Involves nudity but nothing really explicit is described.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway\u2026 Basically\u2026 the title\u2026 but let me explain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my husband (34M) and myself (27F) got married earlier this year and went on our honeymoon shortly after. We have quite a few financially taxing plans coming up in the next few months so we decided to take a short honeymoon to a cabin on a lake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was absolutely beautiful and we would love to have another stay here again. Our favorite parts about this trip are the fact that it was on a lake, had a barbeque and firepit as well as a hot tub on an outside deck with an overview of the lake. Little did I know this trip would\u2019ve been memorable for a completely other reason\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, it\u2019s our honeymoon. There\u2019s a hottub. Yes, I wanted to relax without the restrictions of a bathing suit and it was very freeing and exhilarating. I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On our last day I went ahead and popped in the tub. My husband was grabbing some spare towels and followed me out afterwards shutting the door behind him. The house was old so it shifted a little weird after it was closed so my husband just tugged gently and tried to make sure it was fully closed. All of a sudden\u2026 this is what he says:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hubs: \u201cBabe??? Did you lock the door?\u201d\nMe: \u201cNo?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Husband continued jiggling the doorknob and looked at me like a deer in headlights. The door appeared to be locked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought he was joking. Now my husband is rather silly, he is the funniest person I know in my life and he is the kind that likes to prank me, of course it\u2019s all in good fun. But this made me skeptical of being gullible. I thought this was one of those moments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told him that\u2019s hilarious and to open the door and come get naked in the tub with me (he had his swim trunks on where I left my swimwear inside). He didn\u2019t let up. He told me he wasn\u2019t joking and that the door was really locked and he had no clue how. For a solid 2 minutes I didn\u2019t believe him until he was maniacally pulling and pushing and twisting on the door knob in exaggerated motions demanding he was not joking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My stomach sank and I felt my eyes get the same deer in headlights look. Here we were, in an AirBNB cabin in the middle of nowhere, with our cellphones locked inside and me wearing my birthday suit. I felt like a little child where my parents just spanked me and started inwardly panicking. I kept picturing scenarios in my head where the only option we had would be to pad barefooted wearing nothing but a damn towel to the next door neighbors cabin half a mile down and hope that someone was there to be able to call for help. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I jumped out of the tub and wrapped myself in a towel when I remembered: we left the cabin earlier to grab some food and came back and my husband forgot his phone in the car. His ankle was injured at the time and the walk to the car while not too far was still enough that I offered to get it for him so he wouldn\u2019t be hobbling on his hurt foot much longer. I have a habit of locking doors once we get inside (how we managed to get into this predicament)\u2026 but I didn\u2019t remember locking the front door after grabbing his phone because I went to hand it to him immediately. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I prayed that door was open, prayed that I hadn\u2019t locked the front door and wouldn\u2019t have to be naked except a towel in the middle of nowhere to walk to a strangers house. Of course, I still had to check to make sure he wasn\u2019t messing with me and turns out the door really was locked. (Yes, I still doubted him, he is a big trickster sometimes.) He stared at me with a bewildered look on his face before shouting sarcastically \u201cYES. IT\u2019S REALLY LOCKED!\u201d (In a humorous way, he never really gets mad, the only feelings we felt at that moment was a mix of hilarious hysteria and panic in this situation)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went around the deck to the front door (it wrapped around the house) and held my breath as I turned the knob. The door\u2026 opened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could breathe again. I waddled my naked butt inside and shut the front door, locking it behind me, and walked to the back door leading to the hottub to unlock it. My husband was watching me and simultaneously having a panic attack as he watched me lock the door behind me and was probably also praying I wouldn\u2019t be dumb enough to lock us out again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lucky for him he married a woman that had some brains. They just come late to the party sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All self-deprecating jokes aside, we felt dead relieved that I didn\u2019t have to show up to a strangers house naked.

    "selftext": "So, this happened a couple of days ago, and my wife still isn\u2019t letting me live it down.\n\nI\u2019ve always been the type to mess with my wife for a laugh (don\u2019t worry, she messes with me right back). Recently, I discovered this very specific \u201chack\u201d to get snacks without triggering her supersonic snack radar. Somehow, whenever I tried to sneak a snack from the pantry, she'd hear the slightest crinkle of the bag from another room. Like, I could sneeze right next to her, and she wouldn\u2019t bat an eye, but crinkle a chip bag and she\u2019s there in seconds, giving me *the look.* That\u2019s when \u201ccrinkle karma\u201d was born.\n\nI decided to *invent* something I called \u201ccrinkle karma.\u201d I told her that every time you crinkle a snack bag and *don\u2019t share*, crinkle karma will come for you. Basically, crinkle karma would curse you to spill something, get a stain, or just embarrass yourself snack-wise. She gave me a look like, \u201cYou\u2019re full of it,\u201d but seemed slightly intrigued. So, crinkle karma became our household joke, and I started tossing it around whenever she gave me that look.\n\nFast forward to a few nights later. I\u2019m in the kitchen, barely moving, trying to *avoid the wrath of crinkle karma* by opening a bag of chips *as silently as possible*. My wife walks in and gives me this sneaky smile before whispering, \u201cShhh, crinkle karma.\u201d She actually believed it enough to come get a handful of my chips, guilt-free. At that point, I\u2019m convinced that maybe crinkle karma has some real power over her\u2014*and maybe me too.*\n\nCut to another day or so later. I\u2019m sitting at my computer with a secret stash of Oeros, operating in complete stealth mode to avoid crnkle karma's curse. I\u2019m taking each cookie out slowly, trying to be crinkle-silent. Then, out of nowhere, I hear this random crinkle noise from somewhere in the house. *Cue immediate panic.* I swear my heart skipped a beat, convinced that my nonsense about crinkle karma had somehow come to life and was haunting me.\n\nMy wife finds me mid-panic, holding an Oreo with this wide-eyed look. She puts her hands on her hips and says, \u201cThe ol' Stinky Crinky finally got you, huh?\u201d She has never been more delighted to see me fall victim to my own made-up superstition. And now, she\u2019s constantly warning me about \u201ccrinkle karma\u201d every time I even think about sneaking a snack without sharing.\n\nLesson learned: don\u2019t invent random snack superstitions like crinkle karma unless you\u2019re fully prepared for your wife to turn them against you. Because now, crinkle karma is haunting me on the daily.\n\n  \n**TL;DR:** Tried to mess with my wife by making up \u201ccrinkle karma\u201d as a fake snack-stealing superstition. Now she\u2019s using it to guilt me into sharing snacks constantly, and crinkle karma has officially backfired on me.",

My wife walks in and gives me this sneaky smile before whispering, \u201cShhh, crinkle karma.\u201d She actually believed it enough to come get a handful of my chips, guilt-free. At that point, I\u2019m convinced that maybe crinkle karma has some real power over her\u2014&lt;em&gt;and maybe me too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cut to another day or so later. I\u2019m sitting at my computer with a secret stash of Oeros, operating in complete stealth mode to avoid crnkle karma&amp;#39;s curse. I\u2019m taking each cookie out slowly, trying to be crinkle-silent. Then, out of nowhere, I hear this random crinkle noise from somewhere in the house. &lt;em&gt;Cue immediate panic.&lt;/em&gt; I swear my heart skipped a beat, convinced that my nonsense about crinkle karma had somehow come to life and was haunting me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife finds me mid-panic, holding an Oreo with this wide-eyed look. She puts her hands on her hips and says, \u201cThe ol&amp;#39; Stinky Crinky finally got you, huh?\u201d She has never been more delighted to see me fall victim to my own made-up superstition. And now, she\u2019s constantly warning me about \u201ccrinkle karma\u201d every time I even think about sneaking a snack without sharing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lesson learned: don\u2019t invent random snack superstitions like crinkle karma unless you\u2019re fully prepared for your wife to turn them against you. Because now, crinkle karma is haunting me on the daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Tried to mess with my wife by making up \u201ccrinkle karma\u201d as a fake snack-stealing superstition. Now she\u2019s using it to guilt me into sharing snacks constantly, and crinkle karma has officially backfired on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "I'm a fairly decent cook. I worked in the restaurant industry for 20 years in every role from dishwasher to line cook to restaurant manager, in anywhere from dives to award winning restaurants. And my reward for this earlier this week was a visit from Aunt Rona that progressed into losing my sense of smell in the middle of cooking dinner. I can't smell a thing, believe me, I've tried. This also means I can't taste a thing.\n\nI decided to test this more thoroughly throughout the day. I can't smell my cologne directly out of the bottle, so I tried experimenting with different foods. I now know that I can *detect* foods rather than taste them. I know when something is salty, I can tell if it is bitter, I am aware of umami, I can still get a dull response from sour, and spicy works just fine. I have no idea if something is sweet. But these are senses, not true flavors.\n\nI started this morning with some leftover salmon patties that had been fried in lard, with a side of Dijon mustard. Nothing. Less than the night before, as a matter of fact. It may has well have been prison loaf. Later I had a small, cold, cheddar cheese sandwich on white bread. I knew what I was eating and could feel the sharpness of the cheese, but still no flavor. So I decided to ramp it up a notch.\n\nTotino's pizza rolls with Yellow Bird habanero sauce and limeade. It had less flavor than cardboard despite that being a probable ingredient in 2024. It felt a little like being a three year old at the poker table eating the chips. Mere rectangles of foodlike substance in a spicy nothing with tart, cold neutrality. This is what I would liken to the peak of a bad shroom trip; it seemed to be the height of danger from which I would step down.\n\nLater, I wanted a snack and didn't want to chance spending half of tomorrow on the toilet at work after telling my boss to fuck off while drunk as hell and then calling in with COVID at 2:00 AM and taking the next four days off, so I decided the lava pouches would be a bad idea.\n\nI microwaved a couple of papadums and filled a little bowl with aloo Bukhari, a type of sticky, sour, orange plum grown in Afghanistan. It was equal parts resigning myself to textural eating to at least appreciate mouthfeel, and continuing the experiment with food just littering my pantry. The plums are really sour and usually smell a little like feet. Well, I couldn't smell them, and they were still sour.\n\nI did not consider that papadums are often made with some sort of basic preservative like baking soda or slaked lime when I did this. Nor did I consider the impact lentil flour and dried plums would have on my digestive system. I had just eaten four ibuprofen, as well. The bilge pump was a-churning long before I realized it.\n\nLet's go over the foods one more time:\n\n* Mushy fish patties fried in pork fat\n\n* Cheese sandwich for a lactose intolerant man\n\n* Doubleplus unfood with 2500 Scoville Units\n\n* Enteric coated Fever-B-Gon with science fair volcano fuel\n\nI am not a smart man.\n\nFirst there was a rumble, killers in the jungle. I know that sound, well. Then I got a bit of a seasick feeling that was like half illness, half drugs. And then I threw the blanket across the room and desperately grabbed at my Nintendo Switch, running 10 feet to the toilet, where I spent the next hour and a half cleansing my filthy temple of a body of every burnt sacrifice it had ever been offered. The entire week of Sukkot rioted against this unholy porcelain in protest to pork. A simple British butty came out of my batty sideways. Every jalape\u00f1o within a 20 mile radius instinctively recoiled in horror at the expressions uttered as a legion of habaneros marched to war on the backs of not-pizza, not-solid. And in the end, it was all the same damned color as those fucking prunes.\n\nTL;dr: I ate like a raccoon with a tapeworm despite not being able to taste any of it, and I paid the iron price.",

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a fairly decent cook. I worked in the restaurant industry for 20 years in every role from dishwasher to line cook to restaurant manager, in anywhere from dives to award winning restaurants. And my reward for this earlier this week was a visit from Aunt Rona that progressed into losing my sense of smell in the middle of cooking dinner. I can&amp;#39;t smell a thing, believe me, I&amp;#39;ve tried. This also means I can&amp;#39;t taste a thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to test this more thoroughly throughout the day. I can&amp;#39;t smell my cologne directly out of the bottle, so I tried experimenting with different foods. I now know that I can &lt;em&gt;detect&lt;/em&gt; foods rather than taste them. I know when something is salty, I can tell if it is bitter, I am aware of umami, I can still get a dull response from sour, and spicy works just fine. I have no idea if something is sweet. But these are senses, not true flavors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started this morning with some leftover salmon patties that had been fried in lard, with a side of Dijon mustard. Nothing. Less than the night before, as a matter of fact. It may has well have been prison loaf. Later I had a small, cold, cheddar cheese sandwich on white bread. I knew what I was eating and could feel the sharpness of the cheese, but still no flavor. So I decided to ramp it up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Totino&amp;#39;s pizza rolls with Yellow Bird habanero sauce and limeade. It had less flavor than cardboard despite that being a probable ingredient in 2024. It felt a little like being a three year old at the poker table eating the chips. Mere rectangles of foodlike substance in a spicy nothing with tart, cold neutrality. This is what I would liken to the peak of a bad shroom trip; it seemed to be the height of danger from which I would step down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later, I wanted a snack and didn&amp;#39;t want to chance spending half of tomorrow on the toilet at work after telling my boss to fuck off while drunk as hell and then calling in with COVID at 2:00 AM and taking the next four days off, so I decided the lava pouches would be a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I microwaved a couple of papadums and filled a little bowl with aloo Bukhari, a type of sticky, sour, orange plum grown in Afghanistan. It was equal parts resigning myself to textural eating to at least appreciate mouthfeel, and continuing the experiment with food just littering my pantry. The plums are really sour and usually smell a little like feet. Well, I couldn&amp;#39;t smell them, and they were still sour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did not consider that papadums are often made with some sort of basic preservative like baking soda or slaked lime when I did this. Nor did I consider the impact lentil flour and dried plums would have on my digestive system. I had just eaten four ibuprofen, as well. The bilge pump was a-churning long before I realized it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s go over the foods one more time:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mushy fish patties fried in pork fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheese sandwich for a lactose intolerant man&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubleplus unfood with 2500 Scoville Units&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enteric coated Fever-B-Gon with science fair volcano fuel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not a smart man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First there was a rumble, killers in the jungle. I know that sound, well. Then I got a bit of a seasick feeling that was like half illness, half drugs. And then I threw the blanket across the room and desperately grabbed at my Nintendo Switch, running 10 feet to the toilet, where I spent the next hour and a half cleansing my filthy temple of a body of every burnt sacrifice it had ever been offered. The entire week of Sukkot rioted against this unholy porcelain in protest to pork. A simple British butty came out of my batty sideways. Every jalape\u00f1o within a 20 mile radius instinctively recoiled in horror at the expressions uttered as a legion of habaneros marched to war on the backs of not-pizza, not-solid. And in the end, it was all the same damned color as those fucking prunes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;dr: I ate like a raccoon with a tapeworm despite not being able to taste any of it, and I paid the iron price.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Like biting the bookmark of my notebook while I&amp;#39;m trying to work.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She bit off and ate about 4-5&amp;quot; of the ribbon.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was 30 minutes ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve previously had a cat almost die from eating string.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m at the Animal Urgent Care while they try to induce vomiting.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like the worst cat parent ever.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The photo:\n&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/CUMGXxD\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/CUMGXxD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR didn&amp;#39;t stop cat from eating a ribbon because I wanted to take a photo.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update to add:  they could not induce vomiting so they gave her the drug that reverses the vomiting drug and sent us home.  They told us to wait a little bit for her stomach to settle and then feed her a little bit.   Once that&amp;#39;s settled we got to try to get her to eat as much bulk as possible later tonight with the hopes that big meal turns into a big turd and carries the ribbon out. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I pretty much forgot to wish her a happy mother&amp;#39;s day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only realised this Friday when my brother told me about how he heard SM and my dad talking about how inconsiderate I had been by not doing so, and how she felt pretty bummed about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later today my dad told me about how she was pretty bummed, but suggested I dont bring it up with her or apologise, and that and how its already in the past &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this may seem a pretty small and dumb mistake but she means a lot to me and I honestly don&amp;#39;t know how I could make it up to her &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I forgot to wish my step-mom a happy mother&amp;#39;s day, when I shouldn&amp;#39;t have.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "I (21F) Have been working for a small family owned funeral home for about 4 months now. I have since realized that I don't really like working at this job because of its nature. I actually enjoy the physical parts of the job (e.g. embalming, sanitary care, helping set up funerals, making prayer cards) but what has pushed me away is the people I work for. Maybe its just the nature of the job or how interning is supposed to go in this industry but I have been shouted at infront of other vendors, power tripped on multiple occasions (they threw out my punch in card before I cam in to work), and overall they don't respect me or my time. They know I am a student and keep me after hours when I need to be studying for exams, the worst part is that during the actual work hours they will have me sit there and do legit nothing. I ask if I can help and they tell me theres nothing to do right then, but when it comes time for me to clock out, they give me tasks that could last 2-3 hours long. I don't really know the point of this but that's the backstory to my work environment. They obviously don't like me that much but I may have set them off the most this past weekend.\n\nSo, after work, I was looking through my phone via google photos. I had just gotten a new phone so google photos was setting itself up and trying to find my main account. However, for some reason It chose my work account to set up with instead. For context, my work account is shared between everyone in the office so everyone has access to it. But the absolute nightmare starts when I see a notification saying \"backup from device in progress\". It started to upload all the pictures and videos from my phone onto the public work account. All my photos from 2016-2023 were now on the work account for anyone, including my easily angered boss, to see. Like any normal adult I started to freak out. Scrolling through the feed, I saw pictures of them, work pictures, then a selfie of me, or a picture I used as a drawing refrence. Thank god I had no suggestive photos on my phone but I did have those of me in my natural hair. For context, I am black, in fact, the only black person that works here including all of the outside contractors that they hire to work occasionally. And I am extremely sensitive over my hair. I wear a wig and don't really want other people to see my natural hair as it is kind of a vulnerable place for me to be in. So needless to say I was an absolute wreck. Luckily, I found a way to filter all the photos that came from my device and deleted them. Good news, they all came off the work account! Bad news, I have no more photos on my phone since It wiped them from the DCIM file too. I am really sad about the loss of all my photos but I guess that's the price I have to pay. \n\nWhen I went into work the next day though, everyone was upset when I told them that I turned off backup on the google account. (I did not tell them why I just said I was having issues with my phone so I turned it off) They told me that I disrupted procedures and I was being careless. However, this whole thing happened when I was off at like 2am in the morning. They managed to change the backup settings on their computers within the hour they walked in so I don't necessarily see why they are so upset. I also think my boss is particularly perturbed because I may have seen photos of him with other people than his girlfriend (there was some girl in a bikini on his boat that definitely didn't look like her). So now my boss won't even look me in the eye when he is talking/scolding me and keeps giving me tasks that keep me away from him. I don't think my environment is hostile but I also can't handle all this collective negativity from my co-workers. I don't think I did anything particularly wrong in this instance, but that is technically 4 (grown ass) people all saying that I am the worst against my word. Normally that would mean that I'm in the wrong but I can't tell for sure. \n\nTL;DR: I basically logged into my work account on my new phone and it took all the pictures off my phone and put it on that account for everyone in the office to see. I had to delete my photos off my phone to fix it and turn off backup on the account. Now everyone is mad because I turned off backup even though they have already turned it back on. I really hope none of them have seen my photos and I feel absolutely humiliated.",

    "selftext": "Burner account as I feel my main profile is too associated with my hobbies/professional work.\n\nI (22 Male) recently just got my first house. A small home, a bit off the beaten path, 1 bed, 1 bath; definitely needs a little work, but I have big plans for it. I\u2019m in the process of moving all of my stuff out of my parents house and into my new abode. So far I'm about 80% done. It\u2019s been hectic for me, but fun as I'm experiencing the world for myself.\n\nWhen I bought my home, it came equipped with most appliances. MOST. It lacked a washer and dryer. With this next sentence you\u2019ll probably immediately pick up on where I'm going. I have a 3 year old gray tabby cat that I named Tom-Tom. He currently has some sort of stomach bug or something as he\u2019s been having a hard time holding his bladder. And as the lazy sack of potatoes I am, I left all of my clothes in one box.\n\nOn October 24th, around 11 at night, when IT happened, I decided to hop into the shower. Being that I live alone I chucked the clothes I had on into the same moving box with the rest of my clothes. I spent about 20 minutes in the shower, got myself cleaned up and dried off. I walked back to the box when a putrid smell slammed into my face. My cat leaked all over my clothes. So much so that there were wet marks on all sides of the box. The only thing my cat didn\u2019t urinate on was my shoes, thank god for at least that.\n\nI stood there trying to figure what I could do. I went ahead and put the damp box full of clothes out on my driveway so the stink wouldn\u2019t fill my house. The night was BRISK. I think it was about 39 degrees F. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I thought about washing my clothes in the sink, but then realized I don\u2019t have any decent way to dry them, not to mention how long it would take to wash and dry all of them. I then remembered that I live a 10 minute walk from a laundromat (I do have a car, but I let my Mother borrow it as I didn\u2019t have anywhere I needed to be the next day.)\n\nI was stumped on how I would get down to the laundromat. I could have just used blankets to cover myself, but that would mean I'd have to hold a laundry bag and at least two blankets around myself simultaneously. I then remembered that I have a tri wetsuit. (I use it when I go swimming at a local lake.) The choice was obvious.\n\nI brought out my Roka wetsuit and got in it. I packed all of my damp clothes into a kitchen trash bag and nervously started my walk down the road to the laundromat. A big part of me was like \u201cNow I\u2019m gonna end up on one of those YouTube dashcam compilations\u201d. For anyone who has never worn a wetsuit, especially a tri wetsuit like my Roka Maverick Comp 2, these things are tighter than the average wetsuit and are meant to feel like a second skin, almost like you\u2019re not wearing anything. So that made me feel extremely awkward as I walked down the road. Thankfully though, this road runs through a forest and is not favored by motorists, especially at 12 at night.\n\nAbout 10 minutes into the journey a police car pulled over next to me. I got extremely nervous. I\u2019m a man \u201cdressed\u201d in black walking down a deserted street at 12 AM carrying a black trash bag over my shoulder. He asked me if I was alright and I said yes. He inquired about the bag and told him it\u2019s my laundry. He thankfully didn\u2019t give a second thought (probably since the laundromat was in eye distance).\n\nHe then jokingly asked if I was going swimming while my laundry was washing. I chuckled and explained what happened. He also had a laugh and offered to drive me the rest of the way. I accepted and he dropped me off at the laundromat. After almost two hours my laundry was done and I started walking back to my house. It was thankfully uneventful despite the eeriness of that road. I got home and finally changed out of my wetsuit and into some normal clothes and let Tom-Tom lie beside me in bed.\n\nEdit: To help paint a picture, this is my wetsuit: [Roka Maverick Wetsuit](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91555Oc9QnL._SL1500_.jpg)\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nMoved into my new home that doesn\u2019t have a washer or dryer.

A small home, a bit off the beaten path, 1 bed, 1 bath; definitely needs a little work, but I have big plans for it. I\u2019m in the process of moving all of my stuff out of my parents house and into my new abode. So far I&amp;#39;m about 80% done. It\u2019s been hectic for me, but fun as I&amp;#39;m experiencing the world for myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I bought my home, it came equipped with most appliances. MOST. It lacked a washer and dryer. With this next sentence you\u2019ll probably immediately pick up on where I&amp;#39;m going. I have a 3 year old gray tabby cat that I named Tom-Tom. He currently has some sort of stomach bug or something as he\u2019s been having a hard time holding his bladder. And as the lazy sack of potatoes I am, I left all of my clothes in one box.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On October 24th, around 11 at night, when IT happened, I decided to hop into the shower. Being that I live alone I chucked the clothes I had on into the same moving box with the rest of my clothes. I spent about 20 minutes in the shower, got myself cleaned up and dried off. I walked back to the box when a putrid smell slammed into my face. My cat leaked all over my clothes. So much so that there were wet marks on all sides of the box. The only thing my cat didn\u2019t urinate on was my shoes, thank god for at least that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stood there trying to figure what I could do.

To make things easier on me, my girlfriend (24F) decided we should just get takeout and chill. I agreed. We stopped at home and then she took our puppy and I stayed home to feed our other dog. I also decided to smoke a little weed while she was gone. On her way home, she called and asked if I would come down and help her bring the food and puppy in. I leashed up our other dog to take her out to save a trip. We headed downstairs, but my downstairs neighbor got home at the same time and started walking up to her apartment. My dog and I sat on the stairs until she got inside bc my dog likes to bark at strangers.  We walked a bit until my girlfriend pulled up and I grabbed our drinks and went back upstairs. This is where it all went downhill\u2026 I\u2019m super fucking high at this point btw. My dog decides to lead me to my downstairs neighbor\u2019s apartment. She does this often because we used to live on the second floor of the same apartment building just in the other breezeway. I usually have to correct her, but I was too damn high to notice. I pull down on the handle to go in because I didn\u2019t lock my door when I left since I\u2019d just be downstairs. But the door didn\u2019t budge. I thought \u201cwhat the fuck, did I lock the door? I don\u2019t remember locking the door\u2026\u201d then I pulled on the handle again just to make sure it was definitely locked bc I know I didn\u2019t lock the door, but maybe I did?? So I started checking my pockets for my keys and they were empty. I proceeded to stand there completely puzzled and then I look over to see another flight of stairs and it hits me\u2026 I\u2019m on the second fucking floor. I ran upstairs and went inside. I told my girlfriend what happened after she came in. I contemplated leaving the neighbor a note to apologize, but my girlfriend thinks that would make it creepier if I already freaked her out. I really hope I didn\u2019t terrify that poor girl smh.\n\nTL;DR I got super high because my childhood dog died and in an attempt to take my dog out, I tried walking into my downstairs neighbor\u2019s apartment. Thankfully, it was locked, but I afraid I freaked her out. ",

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I (26M) got a text from my mom on the way home from work saying they had to put my childhood dog down\u2026 this wasn\u2019t a surprise since her health had been declining recently, but it was still very upsetting. To make things easier on me, my girlfriend (24F) decided we should just get takeout and chill. I agreed. We stopped at home and then she took our puppy and I stayed home to feed our other dog. I also decided to smoke a little weed while she was gone. On her way home, she called and asked if I would come down and help her bring the food and puppy in. I leashed up our other dog to take her out to save a trip. We headed downstairs, but my downstairs neighbor got home at the same time and started walking up to her apartment. My dog and I sat on the stairs until she got inside bc my dog likes to bark at strangers.  We walked a bit until my girlfriend pulled up and I grabbed our drinks and went back upstairs. This is where it all went downhill\u2026 I\u2019m super fucking high at this point btw. My dog decides to lead me to my downstairs neighbor\u2019s apartment. She does this often because we used to live on the second floor of the same apartment building just in the other breezeway. I usually have to correct her, but I was too damn high to notice. I pull down on the handle to go in because I didn\u2019t lock my door when I left since I\u2019d just be downstairs. But the door didn\u2019t budge. I thought \u201cwhat the fuck, did I lock the door? I don\u2019t remember locking the door\u2026\u201d then I pulled on the handle again just to make sure it was definitely locked bc I know I didn\u2019t lock the door, but maybe I did?? So I started checking my pockets for my keys and they were empty. I proceeded to stand there completely puzzled and then I look over to see another flight of stairs and it hits me\u2026 I\u2019m on the second fucking floor. I ran upstairs and went inside. I told my girlfriend what happened after she came in. I contemplated leaving the neighbor a note to apologize, but my girlfriend thinks that would make it creepier if I already freaked her out. I really hope I didn\u2019t terrify that poor girl smh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I got super high because my childhood dog died and in an attempt to take my dog out, I tried walking into my downstairs neighbor\u2019s apartment. Thankfully, it was locked, but I afraid I freaked her out. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We connected straight away but both of us were always in relationships and we never considered dating each other - we were good as friends. About 5 years ago when I was going through an irreversible rough patch with my fiance whom I was planning to leave, my best friend was always there for me and we both caved and gave into temptation while he was also in a relationship. I had told one close friend of mine. My fiance and I at the time had planned a destination wedding which I had called off, however, everyone had already booked flights and accommodation, so we all went (except my ex) and had a big party instead. My best friend and I had continued sleeping together this whole time and he remained in his relationship due to the holiday being planned with his (now ex) girlfriend and not wanting to turn that upside down at the worst possible time. While we were at this big party, we screwed with his girlfriend in the same building, and my friend who knew what was going on drunkenly told my ex's friend, and everything snowballed from there in the weeks following the trip. We definitely had feelings for each other but it all became extremely messy with the drama that came with people finding out and I decided to end everything which also meant ending our friendship. After 5 years, I decided to reach out to see how he is going and we immediately clicked and it's like we went back in time 6 years and we talk all day long the same way we used to when we were totally platonic. His friends keep saying it's a bad idea and he should stay away from me, my friends think we are meant to be. \n\nTL;DR We both just really want to be friends as we are happier with each other in our lives and try to block out what everyone else says. He has a new girlfriend now as well which makes things awkward given the history but we've both agreed that his new girlfriend can't find out about our history as she will likely become insecure and not want him to speak to me anymore.",

    "selftext": "This happened last night.\n\nMy partner and I are currently in Japan. After a nice evening last night, we got in the mood for horizontal time and got naked. Somehow while grinding on top of him, I cut my penis on something. No idea what. I didn't feel any pain and was bleeding on him for a few seconds before we both noticed that there was blood between us.\n\nI quickly got off him, thinking it was him. Nope, I was dripping blood onto him, from my penis. It looked like a brutal murder scene already. Because I was a waterfall but blood. I got my frenulum cut open somehow, and have now learned it is FILLED with blood vessels. The blood was squirting out of it like a water balloon that just got poked with a small hole.\n\nI held my penis and ran to the washroom, blood dripping from my hands down onto the floor. It was already on my partner and the sheets. It dripped down all the way to the bathroom. I got in the bathtub. Oh jeez, the tub is red on the sides from my bloody hands. The faucet is bloody, the handle is bloody, the shower head is bloody, it's all just blood. I got a little light headed but sat down in the tub so I wouldn't faint.\n\nThe bleeding stopped after a few minutes of pressure and cold water. The cut was TINY. Smaller than the size of a grain of rice. But the blood coming out of my engorged and pressurized penis was at a rate and projectile capacity that I've never seen before from me. We spent the night cleaning up. At least 2 hours. I tried to fall asleep on my back to try and not end up opening the cut in my sleep because now I was paranoid that I'd open the wound mid sleep, not feel it and just fucking die of blood loss in 2 minutes flat.\n\nTL;DR, I unnoticeably cut my penis open during sex and bled on the sheets, my partner, and the rest of the hotel room.",

    "selftext": "Good evening.\n\nSo I got this great job only a couple months ago. I've been a freelance PR specialist and Journalist for a few years, always hopping cities and generally doing a good job, never staying anywhere too long and generally operating as a bit of a maverick able to solve problems quickly and not always by the book.\n\nI decided it was time to settle down, my career was being hampered by my movement. Working in high level positions in a hundred different places aren't what the big Whigs in London wants, they want to know that I'm reliable, and that I can stay put.\n\nSo I signed on with this care company in Lincolnshire. Id read great things about it and could see they were making strides in places no one else was. The way they run their company was really unique, and I could see the kinks and how to fix them way before I joined.\n\nAnother thing to note here is that I'm young, and autistic. The latter isn't something I'm ever up front about in job interviews, I find I'm either treated like forest gump or rain man based on the flavour of the day.\n\nAnyway I join, and within the first two weeks I'm impressing the higher ups. We sacked the freelance PR team on my recommendation and I pulled out a whole bunch of glaring flaws in the internal communications department I had just joined.\n\nNow this is great for how the company itself received me, but not for my coworkers, who were quite frankly pissed that I was so quick to point out their flaws in the first month of me joining.\n\nThese guys were inexperienced, very few relevant qualifications and all of them having only worked one Comms and PR job in their lives, this one.\n\nThey genuinely had no idea how any of the stuff I was talking about worked, and by the second month my expertise had become a problem for them, I was threatening their senior positions with my background.\n\nWeekly one to one sessions with my manager weren't going well. She was aggravated and defensive. One day I was severely reprimanded for writing a social media report that included analytics.\n\nAny area where I applied my skill set was a problem, and it was obvious to me she was trying to find a way of giving me the boot.\n\nI was set more work than was reasonable, and multiple bogus claims would be filed against me almost on the daily.\nOne report stated that I looked tired, and this was unacceptable for work.\nAnother stated I mismanaged my timing when going to a meeting because I was only half an hour early.\n\nYou get it.\n\nLast week I moved house, the final big move for a while. This was meant to be me settling down and leaving the nomadic life behind.\n\nIn the move my girlfriend helped me pack, and she put my work phone in her bag. I didn't know it was there, and my first day back at work I had to go without.\n\nI checked with IT where it was using the tracker and saw it was in my new house. Didn't file it as missing because it was obvious the phone was just in one of the boxes ready to be unpacked.\n\nFor the week ahead I forged on giving people my alt phone to contact me, and got on with my job as normal.\n\nThat was until my manager confronted me directly about it. She asked me where it was and this is where I fucked up.\n\nI panicked, every little mistake was a reprimand. Every tiny thing I did was scrutinised, and I knew that despite everything I was doing right, and all the praise I was getting from other departments, this one person wanted me gone.\n\nI told her it was getting repaired.\n\nWe work in the homes so this is a pretty normal thing. Some of the people we support can get a bit handsy and are prone to accidentally breaking things.\n\nSo as far as I was concerned it was a pretty good lie, and harmless. It took me out of the firing line.\n\nLittle did I know she would call it later that day.\nAnd who picked up but my girlfriend who was searching it at home.\n\nShe assumed it was me and answered, \"hey I found it!\"\n\nThe next day I was hauled into a room with HR. Informed that I had facilitated a data leak and allowed someone outside the company access to my device and kicked out on my ass.\n\nI did have a lot of support against my leaving.\nIT wrote a letter to the Comms department urging them to reconsider given that I had followed the correct procedure in ensuring there was no data leak.\n\nThe higher ups even backed me stating that whilst I did lie, undermining my integrity, that I had in practice done nothing wrong.\n\nAnd whilst I was invited to appeal this case I feel it was largely pointless.\n\nHow could I continue to work in an environment where my direct manager is actively trying to sabotage me?\n\nTL:DR\n\nPissed off my department head at a new job by revealing glaring issues in the company.\nMisplaced my work phone in a move and lied about it's whereabouts allowing them to fire me for risking a data leak.",

Informed that I had facilitated a data leak and allowed someone outside the company access to my device and kicked out on my ass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did have a lot of support against my leaving.\nIT wrote a letter to the Comms department urging them to reconsider given that I had followed the correct procedure in ensuring there was no data leak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The higher ups even backed me stating that whilst I did lie, undermining my integrity, that I had in practice done nothing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And whilst I was invited to appeal this case I feel it was largely pointless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How could I continue to work in an environment where my direct manager is actively trying to sabotage me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pissed off my department head at a new job by revealing glaring issues in the company.\nMisplaced my work phone in a move and lied about it&amp;#39;s whereabouts allowing them to fire me for risking a data leak.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

This is something I picked up as soon as I moved into my own apartment when I was 18. It's hot indoors at all times, and when I go home after gym or jogging I'm also hot and sweaty so I instinctively take off all my clothes as soon as I step foot inside, sometimes but not always my underwear included. So yes, you can assume that today after workout I got into my birthday suit as they call it when I got home lol.\n\nFor some more context, me and my friends and some other students from college have this group chat on discord, not too big of a group (fortunately lmao), we're 12 people in there. We have some pretty demanding and most importantly *deadly* boring classes and so only a few of us attend the fucking narcolepsy-inducing lectures. Today, I was one of those few people.\n\nSo one of the chat pals asked for today's notes and you bet I was willing to help a friend. So I got my notebook out of my backpack in my room and took a few pics of the pages real quick and just mindlessly posted them. Then I took a shower. When I was done I look at the phone and the first message I see was \"nice cock bro\" and I was like ok that's weird, only to realize that in 4 out of 6 pictures of the notebook pages there it was, my glorious flaccid dick right underneath. Turns out I did not bother to hold the notebook upright or at least hold it further from my body so that my genitals are out of view...\n\nAnd yes they are still teasing me about it as we speak. I did say it was an accident I didn't mean to fuckin flash everyone on chat and I don't know if I should play it off as a joke or something but the point is I am *so* embarrassed and I don't know if I wanna meet any of my friends in person now. And no, nobody commented about its size positively so I didn't even get some pride out of the embarrassment...\n\nTl;dr I accidentally flashed my friends in a group chat by not taking my fucking cock out of view when taking photos of a notebook aiming down.",

    "selftext": "A few days ago my roommate informed me that her parents were on their way to our apartment to check up on her since she had not been feeling well. Me on the other hand, I was feeling fucking great, until my roommate mentioned that her parents believed I was gay. Now you might be wondering why. Well, so did I. My roommate said her parents would never have approved of their daughter moving in with a male roommate, so instead of standing her ground and telling her mom and dad that she was old enough to live with whoever she wanted, she was like, nah... the gay roommate story sounded better. \n\nI had very little time to absorb all of this information because the parents were coming and my roommate wanted to know from me if I was willing to play the part of the gay roommate. I said I was more willing to leave the apartment before her parents showed up and avoid pretending to be gay. My roommate said her parents were under the impression that I was taking care of her while she was sick, so it would make more sense if I was at the apartment. I was on the verge of saying no, until she played her \"you owe me\" card out of desperation and then attempted to downplay the position she was putting me in by saying it's not like I had to \"act gay\" or anything. \n\nCut to me in pretend gay mode when my roommate's parents arrived. To my roommate's surprise, her parents were not alone. Her brother decided to visit too. My roommate was over the moon when she saw him. It was obvious that the two of them had not seen each other in ages. While brother and sister were milking every wholesome minute of their sibling reunion, mom and dad gravitated towards me. Cue awkward small talk. The dad asked me what my pronouns were and the mom wanted to know if I had a bf. My answer to the dad was he/him and my answer to the mom was no. The mom said she refused to believe that an attractive young man like me was single. She made sure she said it loud enough so that everyone could hear. \n\nMy roommate's brother rolled his eyes as he looked at me and said his relationship with his ex bf came to an end literally like a week ago, but despite his recent break up, his mother was unashamedly playing matchmaker with the first available gay guy she came across. I looked at my roommate and low key attempted to communicate my discomfort with my eyes. I was trying to show her what was going through my mind at that moment, which was \"would've been fucking nice if I knew your brother was gay before I agreed to stop being straight.\" My roommate coughed all of a sudden and continued coughing until someone finally asked if she was dying. It was not the most subtle way of changing the subject, but at least she got the job done. \n\nI eventually excused myself and allowed my roommate to be alone with her family. I was in my room for like 20 minutes before I got an unexpected message from my roommate. The message was a warning or whatever that her brother was on his way to my room for some reason. Seconds later someone was knocking on my door. I took a deep breath and opened the door. It was indeed my roommate's brother. He said he wanted to thank me for taking care of his sister because he knew from personal experience what a pain in the ass she could be when she's sick. I said it was no problem. Then came an uncomfortable silence before my roommate's brother said he had a question for me. I automatically sighed on the inside. The brother wanted to know if I was gay or bi because he checked out my IG and saw photos of me with my roommate, aka his sister, and apparently our body language in these photos made him feel like we might be more than just roommates. \n\nThe voice in my head said drop the act and just come clean, but the weed in my system said commit to the role and stay in character.

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago my roommate informed me that her parents were on their way to our apartment to check up on her since she had not been feeling well. Me on the other hand, I was feeling fucking great, until my roommate mentioned that her parents believed I was gay. Now you might be wondering why. Well, so did I. My roommate said her parents would never have approved of their daughter moving in with a male roommate, so instead of standing her ground and telling her mom and dad that she was old enough to live with whoever she wanted, she was like, nah... the gay roommate story sounded better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had very little time to absorb all of this information because the parents were coming and my roommate wanted to know from me if I was willing to play the part of the gay roommate. I said I was more willing to leave the apartment before her parents showed up and avoid pretending to be gay. My roommate said her parents were under the impression that I was taking care of her while she was sick, so it would make more sense if I was at the apartment. I was on the verge of saying no, until she played her &amp;quot;you owe me&amp;quot; card out of desperation and then attempted to downplay the position she was putting me in by saying it&amp;#39;s not like I had to &amp;quot;act gay&amp;quot; or anything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cut to me in pretend gay mode when my roommate&amp;#39;s parents arrived. To my roommate&amp;#39;s surprise, her parents were not alone. Her brother decided to visit too. My roommate was over the moon when she saw him. It was obvious that the two of them had not seen each other in ages. While brother and sister were milking every wholesome minute of their sibling reunion, mom and dad gravitated towards me. Cue awkward small talk. The dad asked me what my pronouns were and the mom wanted to know if I had a bf. My answer to the dad was he/him and my answer to the mom was no. The mom said she refused to believe that an attractive young man like me was single. She made sure she said it loud enough so that everyone could hear. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My roommate&amp;#39;s brother rolled his eyes as he looked at me and said his relationship with his ex bf came to an end literally like a week ago, but despite his recent break up, his mother was unashamedly playing matchmaker with the first available gay guy she came across. I looked at my roommate and low key attempted to communicate my discomfort with my eyes. I was trying to show her what was going through my mind at that moment, which was &amp;quot;would&amp;#39;ve been fucking nice if I knew your brother was gay before I agreed to stop being straight.&amp;quot; My roommate coughed all of a sudden and continued coughing until someone finally asked if she was dying. It was not the most subtle way of changing the subject, but at least she got the job done. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I eventually excused myself and allowed my roommate to be alone with her family. I was in my room for like 20 minutes before I got an unexpected message from my roommate. The message was a warning or whatever that her brother was on his way to my room for some reason. Seconds later someone was knocking on my door. I took a deep breath and opened the door. It was indeed my roommate&amp;#39;s brother. He said he wanted to thank me for taking care of his sister because he knew from personal experience what a pain in the ass she could be when she&amp;#39;s sick. I said it was no problem. Then came an uncomfortable silence before my roommate&amp;#39;s brother said he had a question for me. I automatically sighed on the inside. The brother wanted to know if I was gay or bi because he checked out my IG and saw photos of me with my roommate, aka his sister, and apparently our body language in these photos made him feel like we might be more than just roommates. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The voice in my head said drop the act and just come clean, but the weed in my system said commit to the role and stay in character. I stupidly opted for the latter and said the following: &amp;quot;bro... I am so fucking gay... I would empty my balls inside you and your dad before I even considered having sex with your sister.&amp;quot; As soon as I said that, I stopped hearing sounds coming from the living room, which was where my roommate and her parents were. Everyone went from talking to not talking by the end of my sentence. It occurred to me that I might have said what I said with too much passion and forgot that my apartment was small.

    "selftext": "In rare TIFU form, this happened about an hour ago and I am mortified.\n\nI had a virtual interview this morning for a contract gig with a pharmaceutical firm, and as with all the video interviews I do, I set up on the attic of my house on the third floor to avoid distractions from background noises  from my family. The attic room is finished as an office, so it looks professional, and my cats rarely go up there so it's a good place for a private call or a video meeting. I have a node for my Wi-Fi extender in that room so the connection is stable and fast.  There is not a door to the attic stairs though, we took it off to allow better air circulation and to allow more space in the hallway on the second floor. (The doorway for the attic is right up against the stairs, leaving the door open creates a navigation hazard for my handicapped brother.)\n\nLike I said, the cats \\*rarely\\* go up to the attic. Except today. Just as the interview started one of the cats, Moe, decided to \"hide\" behind my laptop and play with the cord to my camera. I scooped him up and put him on the floor, thinking that the \"glitch\" for this meeting was past, because there is always a glitch at some point. \n\nThe interview was going great, we're having a good conversation about the role and the skills I bring to it when the cats come into the attic. At first they are just playing in the background, so no big deal. I was about to blur the background when they chased each other down the stairs and out of sight. Here is where the FU happened.\n\nAs we were about half way through a 45 minute meeting, Moe jumped back up on the desk and started walking across my keyboard. No big deal, but I did not want him to flash his butthole to the camera so I scooped him up again. Except this time Moe did not want to be scooped up and started to protest by getting squirmy. I let him squirm as I lifted him up and moved him back to the floor and he struck out with his back leg, kicking me in the face. With his claws. Hard. \n\nAt first I laughed about it with the people on the call, because cats, right? But then I noticed in the thumbnail of my video that i was bleeding, and not just a little bit, but the kind of blood you get when your cat scratches your cheek from the bottom of your eyelid to your nose. It looked like I was weeping blood. I excused myself to get a tissue to staunch the flow and told the people on the call I would go off camera so they wouldn't have to watch me holding a tissue to my face as I bled through the rest of the call, but they each said to stay on camera that they understood, and we continued. They asked a few more questions, I had a couple for them, and we wrapped up on a personal note about our shared hobbies. All while I was bleeding through my second tissue. \n\nOverall I thought the interview went well, but I could have done without the facial laceration. At least they will remember me. \n\n  \nTL;DR My cat Moe kicked me in the face during a video interview. I bled like a stuck pig.",

At first they are just playing in the background, so no big deal. I was about to blur the background when they chased each other down the stairs and out of sight. Here is where the FU happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we were about half way through a 45 minute meeting, Moe jumped back up on the desk and started walking across my keyboard. No big deal, but I did not want him to flash his butthole to the camera so I scooped him up again. Except this time Moe did not want to be scooped up and started to protest by getting squirmy. I let him squirm as I lifted him up and moved him back to the floor and he struck out with his back leg, kicking me in the face. With his claws. Hard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first I laughed about it with the people on the call, because cats, right? But then I noticed in the thumbnail of my video that i was bleeding, and not just a little bit, but the kind of blood you get when your cat scratches your cheek from the bottom of your eyelid to your nose. It looked like I was weeping blood. I excused myself to get a tissue to staunch the flow and told the people on the call I would go off camera so they wouldn&amp;#39;t have to watch me holding a tissue to my face as I bled through the rest of the call, but they each said to stay on camera that they understood, and we continued. They asked a few more questions, I had a couple for them, and we wrapped up on a personal note about our shared hobbies. All while I was bleeding through my second tissue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall I thought the interview went well, but I could have done without the facial laceration. At least they will remember me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR My cat Moe kicked me in the face during a video interview. I bled like a stuck pig.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "To those of you who might have wondered if it\u2019s worthwhile to eat a bag of edibles before boarding a flight, my experience might make you think twice. I figured that if I popped a few \u201cspecial\u201d chocolates after arriving at the airport (but before going through security), I\u2019d sink comfortably into my seat on the plane, have a great time watching a light hearted in-flight comedy movie, and painlessly arrive at my destination before I even knew it. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong.\n\nInstead, I ended up living my own version of the \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 to Disney World\u201d joke, making an incredible fool of myself in front of airport staff, and armed my wife with a story she loves to remind me of - she thinks it\u2019s still just as hilarious as it was the day it happened.\u00a0\n\nMy wife and I had wanted to visit Disneyland as adults for years - imagining how much fun many of the classic rides there would be after a couple beers, and otherwise really just taking the time to appreciate it all in a way we probably never could have when we were kids. Earlier this year, we finally took the chance to go, and booked our tickets - excited to take a real vacation, and escape to the fantasy world of a Disney park for a few days.\u00a0\n\nAs the real genius I am, I figured I could only enhance the otherwise boring, uncomfortable and fairly long flight by eating a bunch of edibles once we got to the airport. I figured my timing was perfect - they wouldn\u2019t start kicking in until after we had gotten through security, and they\u2019d last until we arrive, and settled in at our hotel in Anaheim. Except even with my decent tolerance at the time, these particular edibles hit me like a truck, coming at me full-speed. Even after 20 minutes or so, I was already exploring space while in line at security - it took extra concentration to go through each step at the scanners, and even emptying my pockets into the tray on the x-ray conveyor belt was a real fuckin\u2019 struggle.\u00a0\n\nBy the time we settled into our seats by our gate, I knew I needed to find a way to shake it off. I (pretty abruptly, my wife told me later) stood up and let her know I needed to go for a walk by myself - I figured that would help keep me grounded, and focused on other things. I was also getting worried about being literally grounded - if the gate agents or any of the flight attendants figured out how absolutely blasted I was, they\u2019d probably deny me boarding. After a few minutes, the walk was starting to help, and it was time I headed back to my gate - my boarding time was coming up, and I was going to have to hope I looked at least somewhat sober when getting on the plane.\u00a0\n\nLooking around the part of the airport I was in, I didn\u2019t recognize anything around me. Glancing up to the sign above me, my stomach sank when it read \u201cBaggage Claim and Taxi Pickup.\u201d I had somehow gotten out of the departure area - I must have walked through one of those one-way gates you often go through at your destination, without even noticing. I was going to have to go back through security again, and I figured I was screwed. In my head, the TSA agent was going to know how baked I was, and they were going to tell the airline I can\u2019t fly. As I was walking back to the security entrance, my sky-high brain was racing - jumping to the conclusion that I was about to ruin the entire trip by getting our flight cancelled, and my wife was going to be upset, disappointed, and let down. What if getting denied boarding was the last straw in a secret, long list of grievances? What if this event is the catalyst that leads to our marriage falling apart? What if that sends me spiraling into a depression that costs me my job, and I end up living alone in a cardboard box? Such are the thought paths of someone having an exceptionally bad time while absolutely schwacked.\u00a0\n\nI arrive back at the security checkpoint, only to seemingly have my fears confirmed. The TSA agent scanning boarding passes at the beginning of the line takes a look at me and says \u201cWait a minute, didn\u2019t you already come through here? I swear I saw you like half an hour ago. What are you doing back here?\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn my state of panic, I try my hardest to come up with a casual, yet clear explanation to reply with - something a totally sober guy might say. I manage to muster up my best effort - while not even looking at the TSA agent (I thought I couldn\u2019t let my eyes give myself away, after all!), I reply with a sentence of pure literary mastery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cUhhhh.. I dunno.\u201d\u00a0\n\nExcept I didn\u2019t even annunciate the words - I just shrugged my shoulders and sort of mumbled it, in a sing-song kind of way. And all while mostly either staring at the floor, or gazing off into the distance. She then pauses for a moment, says \u201cHmm, ok then,\u201d and asks to see my boarding pass again. She takes a quick glance at it, and asks \u201cOff to LA today?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, Disneyland!\u201d I replied cheerfully. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t just say yes (I was going to LAX) - I guess I was trying to make conversation? Beats me, now that I\u2019m looking back on it. Right then, the TSA woman looks at me as if she had just made a grand realization - and I figure I\u2019m screwed. She\u2019s on to me. But instead of asking me if I\u2019ve had anything to drink, smoke, or if I was ok to fly, she completely changes her tone of voice. Now, in a happy, higher pitched but slower tone, says back to me \u201cOhhh how exciting! Well if you got lost, that\u2019s ok! We can help you get back! Then once you get to Disneyland, you\u2019ll get to have soooo much fun on all the rides!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile I\u2019m standing there, obliviously thinking to myself \u201cYeah, I will have fun! Thanks, strangely friendly TSA lady!\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn her now extra well pronounced, basic words, she then asks if I have anyone waiting for me at the gate - like an assistant or something. The \u201cassistant\u201d question got me confused - is that some sort of policy-based question I had never heard before? I tell her a simple \u201cNo,\u201d while probably still glaring at the wall or something. She then asks if I need any extra help at security, and tells me to \u201csay hi to Micky for me!\u201d Smiling, but still freaking out and slightly confused inside, I let out a simple \u201cThanks!\u201d and go back through the scanner - I just had to get out of there as quickly as I could.\u00a0\n\nNow walking back towards my wife at the gate, it all hits me like a ton of bricks. The TSA agent thought I was another form of \u201cincapacitated\u201d entirely - someone who rode the short bus going to school, and is now on a field trip to Disneyland with support workers and aides. Now turning beat red, I sit back down beside my wife, and before she could say anything, I blurt out: \u201cThe entire security staff back there think I\u2019m legitimately mentally handicapped.\u201d\u00a0\n\nShe still looks back on that as one of her favorite moments of our marriage so far. And as it happens, the flight itself wasn\u2019t even any better on the edibles, either.\u00a0\n\n**TL;DR**: I took too many edibles at the airport before a flight, and somehow wandered out of the departures area. I had to go back through security again to get back to my gate, now worried that I\u2019d be deemed too intoxicated to fly - only to instead have TSA think I was mentally handicapped and requiring special needs assistance.\u00a0",

Right then, the TSA woman looks at me as if she had just made a grand realization - and I figure I\u2019m screwed. She\u2019s on to me. But instead of asking me if I\u2019ve had anything to drink, smoke, or if I was ok to fly, she completely changes her tone of voice. Now, in a happy, higher pitched but slower tone, says back to me \u201cOhhh how exciting! Well if you got lost, that\u2019s ok! We can help you get back! Then once you get to Disneyland, you\u2019ll get to have soooo much fun on all the rides!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I\u2019m standing there, obliviously thinking to myself \u201cYeah, I will have fun! Thanks, strangely friendly TSA lady!\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In her now extra well pronounced, basic words, she then asks if I have anyone waiting for me at the gate - like an assistant or something. The \u201cassistant\u201d question got me confused - is that some sort of policy-based question I had never heard before? I tell her a simple \u201cNo,\u201d while probably still glaring at the wall or something. She then asks if I need any extra help at security, and tells me to \u201csay hi to Micky for me!\u201d Smiling, but still freaking out and slightly confused inside, I let out a simple \u201cThanks!\u201d and go back through the scanner - I just had to get out of there as quickly as I could.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now walking back towards my wife at the gate, it all hits me like a ton of bricks. The TSA agent thought I was another form of \u201cincapacitated\u201d entirely - someone who rode the short bus going to school, and is now on a field trip to Disneyland with support workers and aides. Now turning beat red, I sit back down beside my wife, and before she could say anything, I blurt out: \u201cThe entire security staff back there think I\u2019m legitimately mentally handicapped.\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She still looks back on that as one of her favorite moments of our marriage so far. And as it happens, the flight itself wasn\u2019t even any better on the edibles, either.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: I took too many edibles at the airport before a flight, and somehow wandered out of the departures area. I had to go back through security again to get back to my gate, now worried that I\u2019d be deemed too intoxicated to fly - only to instead have TSA think I was mentally handicapped and requiring special needs assistance.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "I 28(m) was awoken by her 30(f) this morning playing music. We joked a bit about the music. I recalled she was on teledoc the night before about lack of energy and general malaise. When I remembered this, I asked if she wanted me to pick it up for her (I needed to grab a refill of my medication as well.) She\u2019s a nurse and is always spread pretty thin so I\u2019ve been picking up her meds and running other errands for her for years now. Me getting her meds has been the norm, so I asked if it was ready for pickup. \n\nShe became furious with me, saying her meds were none of my business, and to back off. I didn\u2019t press the matter as to allowing me to pick it up, but I groggily tried to clarify I didn\u2019t mean anything  and I didn\u2019t want to pry either. I just wanted to get it for her so she didn\u2019t have to, just like every last month. I should have shut up. What ensued was her talking over me every time I spoke, raising her voice, and me trying to raise mine to match. We both got pretty mad, but no one crossed any lines during the conversation. At one point I was speaking very slowly and rather quietly about that I didn\u2019t want anything to be wrong, and I didn\u2019t want her to misunderstand, and that I was going to give her space. When I looked up at her after I said this, (I was on the other side of the room), I saw she had her phone out and it was ringing. I was in disbelief when I heard \u201c911 what\u2019s your emergency,\u201d on the other end. \n\nOne night before this she had been triggered by a friend of ours getting too excited in a game we were playing. (Online game, Discord chat, friend is in another state) He got a little loud but maintained a joking tone. Everyone else was laughing. After a while, she came into the same room as me and had me feel her heart and told me how much it bothered her. She has a tough past and I know she can get triggered. However, for the past 3 years she\u2019s been very resilient, and only just now started getting really sensitive again. \n\nI understand I scared her but I want to emphasize that this was not a one sided thing and I have been with her for almost seven years now. For the first 99% of the conversation this was a somewhat tense and at times a little loud altercation, but nothing we haven\u2019t had before, and something that isn\u2019t uncommon in most relationships. We\u2019ve had louder fights where she\u2019s said some really terrible things to me and told me she was done with me, only to act like it never happened a little while later. I regret yelling, I wish I never felt like it was yell or be misunderstood, but just try to understand yelling isn\u2019t all the same. \n\nWhen I saw she was calling the cops, I calmly and promptly gathered my keys and phone and walked out of the apartment. I heard her tell the operator that she was reporting a domestic dispute. As I walked to my car I also called 911 and informed that I am apparently in a domestic dispute, told my name, my address, my appearance, my car appearance, and where I would be (just up the road.) I drove up the road and waited on the corner, sitting on the curb. \n\nI got a call from my dad while I waited asking if I was okay,  and he informed me she had called him saying she didn\u2019t know where I went, that I \u201cstormed out\u201d and that she was packing my bags because we were through. (Mind you I moved to this area, Chicagoland area, to live with her 5 years ago, my dad live 15 hours away.)\n\nAs I was talking to him, carefully trying not to foul his opinion of her while also trying to let him know I\u2019m not out of control and I\u2019m not fully sure what\u2019s going on, the police pulled up and began to talk to me. \n\nI calmly told them the story, almost broke down once, and they were actually very understanding and reassuring. They asked me if she was taking her medication and I told them I thought she was. They asked if i thought it was all right if they checked on her and I encouraged them to speak to her because I didn\u2019t want them to only hear from me or let me talk for her. I was under the impression other officers would be in the apartment talking to her at this time. Unbeknownst to me she actually told the operator, after I had left, that she didn\u2019t want any officers to come by and that she didn\u2019t want anything bad to happen to me. Idk what she wanted then. Prior to the officers leaving to check on her, they told me I handled the situation exactly as I should, and that I should wait there. \n\nThey ended up talking to her in our apartment for about 5 minutes and she sent them back to check on me. As I waited, in my car at this time at the same location where I was sat, after a little bit, I decided to call and check on her. I asked her whether she spoke to the cops, and she said yes, that they should be on their way to me, and right on queue they pulled up behind me. They said everything was fine, and the male cop starting giving me advice on where to go from there. \n\nAfter they left, I went back to the apartment, and started talking to her/packing my things. The first argument started at about noon, I was out of the house by 1:30ish, and back in by about 3pm. At 9pm, she called it all off. She told me she still loved me, I apologized for everything. I told her she really scared me too, and there were maybe somethings she shouldn\u2019t have done. Early on in our relationship I knew she could be sensitive so I always avoided yelling. At one point I was told by a therapist that I should be more willing to set boundaries in the relationship, as some of our problems were related to that. They said in most situations yelling should be avoided and I agree. But there indeed are situations where someone should increase the volume of their voice if they are being spoken over in a situation where they need to have boundaries respected or stand up for themselves. In this situation I believed the very extreme misunderstanding was just something I needed to clarify before walking away, as if I left it like that, she would have continued to believe I was trying to do something wrong. At the same time, keep in mind I\u2019m laying in bed half awake when this started. I feel like if anything she caught me off guard and started acting strange when I was in a vulnerable position. Scaring her isn\u2019t justified and it makes me sick to think I did, but I also cannot truthfully say this was a situation in which she would have been afraid any month prior to this one, and I cannot say I had any upper hand or advantage or that I was cornering her or in her face or anything. I was facing away from her for most of the conversation and only got up to leave the room when I  was trying to clarify right before she called them. \n\nWhen she called off kicking me out, I promised I wouldn\u2019t raise my voice anymore. This isn\u2019t a hard promise for me to make. I had done it before and only started raising my voice because I believed it was important to show controlled sternness when necessary, something I think she should be able to do as well, and something she does do.  \n\nAt any rate, it\u2019s now two days later, we have been cuddling, getting food together, watching tiktoks, and she has again decided, due to a quiet disagreement before bed last night, which we spoke about very civilly and very quietly and actually quite briefly, which she can\u2019t get out of her mind, that because we have problems sometimes, which she magnifies as \u201cwe have constant issues,\u201d we are incompatible. She is now calmly kicking me out, (I didn\u2019t unpack just in case,) sans the police. \n\nI love her. She was obsessed with me before we started dating and we have been in love for 6 years now. It\u2019s just so hard to think it got like this. And I know it really seems like something must have happened but I swear she is not acting herself. I asked her a question two days ago so I could run an errand and it escalated very slowly and not even that much and she eventually decided to call the police. I don\u2019t have a criminal record, I don\u2019t hurt people or women or animals or anyone. It\u2019s horrifying. I left my life to live with her. As I have been living with her, she decided she made enough money that she didn\u2019t need me to work anymore and wanted me to take care of the dog and the house and help her out with anything. I\u2019m always trying to find ways to help. \n\nAt any rate I\u2019m now left jobless, homeless, and 15 hours away from my family in Chicago. The love of my life is acting like a different person and I feel like she only hears half of everything I\u2019m saying. \n\nI wanted to marry her. If I needed to find a way to buy a ring to propose, then it was going to take time in our situation. Otherwise, I\u2019m also not against her proposing, but she never did, despite 100% having the means. Maybe she never really wanted to despite everything. I don\u2019t know. \n\nSo now I\u2019m packing my things into my car and getting ready to leave. I don\u2019t really know where to go or what to do except back to where I was born. It just feels like I wasted 6 years of my life, and lost all the connections and progress that I had before I moved. Before I met her I had a job and friends and I was close with my family and I had a place to live. Then I met her and gained a girlfriend and a future wife. Now I have none of it. \n\nTL;DR: I asked her when her medication would be ready, she misunderstood me? and we raised our voices. She called the cops. She\u2019s breaking up with me. We\u2019ve been together for 6 years and wanted to get married. \n\nEdit: \nIf anyone wants to reach out and message me they are invited to do so. I don\u2019t want anyone to do so out of pity but more because they want to. I don\u2019t want anyone to be burdened by it. I have my family but I can\u2019t just talk to them about it right now. It would help to have someone check in with me\u2026 thank you all for the insight\n\nUpdate; see extra comment \nMade it back. Bad times were had on the drive home. It\u2019s hard to be here. But I\u2019m physically safe! All that matters!",

The first argument started at about noon, I was out of the house by 1:30ish, and back in by about 3pm. At 9pm, she called it all off. She told me she still loved me, I apologized for everything. I told her she really scared me too, and there were maybe somethings she shouldn\u2019t have done. Early on in our relationship I knew she could be sensitive so I always avoided yelling. At one point I was told by a therapist that I should be more willing to set boundaries in the relationship, as some of our problems were related to that. They said in most situations yelling should be avoided and I agree. But there indeed are situations where someone should increase the volume of their voice if they are being spoken over in a situation where they need to have boundaries respected or stand up for themselves. In this situation I believed the very extreme misunderstanding was just something I needed to clarify before walking away, as if I left it like that, she would have continued to believe I was trying to do something wrong. At the same time, keep in mind I\u2019m laying in bed half awake when this started. I feel like if anything she caught me off guard and started acting strange when I was in a vulnerable position. Scaring her isn\u2019t justified and it makes me sick to think I did, but I also cannot truthfully say this was a situation in which she would have been afraid any month prior to this one, and I cannot say I had any upper hand or advantage or that I was cornering her or in her face or anything. I was facing away from her for most of the conversation and only got up to leave the room when I  was trying to clarify right before she called them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she called off kicking me out, I promised I wouldn\u2019t raise my voice anymore. This isn\u2019t a hard promise for me to make. I had done it before and only started raising my voice because I believed it was important to show controlled sternness when necessary, something I think she should be able to do as well, and something she does do.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At any rate, it\u2019s now two days later, we have been cuddling, getting food together, watching tiktoks, and she has again decided, due to a quiet disagreement before bed last night, which we spoke about very civilly and very quietly and actually quite briefly, which she can\u2019t get out of her mind, that because we have problems sometimes, which she magnifies as \u201cwe have constant issues,\u201d we are incompatible. She is now calmly kicking me out, (I didn\u2019t unpack just in case,) sans the police. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love her. She was obsessed with me before we started dating and we have been in love for 6 years now. It\u2019s just so hard to think it got like this. And I know it really seems like something must have happened but I swear she is not acting herself. I asked her a question two days ago so I could run an errand and it escalated very slowly and not even that much and she eventually decided to call the police. I don\u2019t have a criminal record, I don\u2019t hurt people or women or animals or anyone. It\u2019s horrifying. I left my life to live with her. As I have been living with her, she decided she made enough money that she didn\u2019t need me to work anymore and wanted me to take care of the dog and the house and help her out with anything. I\u2019m always trying to find ways to help. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At any rate I\u2019m now left jobless, homeless, and 15 hours away from my family in Chicago. The love of my life is acting like a different person and I feel like she only hears half of everything I\u2019m saying. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to marry her. If I needed to find a way to buy a ring to propose, then it was going to take time in our situation. Otherwise, I\u2019m also not against her proposing, but she never did, despite 100% having the means. Maybe she never really wanted to despite everything. I don\u2019t know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I\u2019m packing my things into my car and getting ready to leave. I don\u2019t really know where to go or what to do except back to where I was born. It just feels like I wasted 6 years of my life, and lost all the connections and progress that I had before I moved. Before I met her I had a job and friends and I was close with my family and I had a place to live. Then I met her and gained a girlfriend and a future wife. Now I have none of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I asked her when her medication would be ready, she misunderstood me? and we raised our voices. She called the cops. She\u2019s breaking up with me. We\u2019ve been together for 6 years and wanted to get married. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: \nIf anyone wants to reach out and message me they are invited to do so. I don\u2019t want anyone to do so out of pity but more because they want to. I don\u2019t want anyone to be burdened by it. I have my family but I can\u2019t just talk to them about it right now. It would help to have someone check in with me\u2026 thank you all for the insight&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update; see extra comment \nMade it back. Bad times were had on the drive home. It\u2019s hard to be here. But I\u2019m physically safe! All that matters!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "School pickup is a dangerous mess of cars going too fast from one million different lanes, and families trying to cross a busy road on top of it. Every day I'm trying not to cause or be offed by a car wreck and also not accidentally run down a family. \n\nToday I picked up one kid from school and my mom picked up the other. I was leaving from one parking lot with one kid in my car, and my mom, from the lot across the busy street with my other kid in her car. \n\nI say this with love and also frustration: my mom is someone who will make the simplest tasks infinitely difficult by trying to guess what the other person will want, and bending over backwards to try and make it easier for them. Except it always makes it harder. Every time. \n\nSo there we were, my mom and I, two cars waiting to turn across a busy four lane street. Cars flying by. People walking everywhere. Cars waiting behind me, for me to turn. I see my mom across the way. She needs to turn right so then I can turn left, as is the way of traffic rules. And turning right is pretty easy! But she won't do it, because she's waiting for me to turn left, which is very hard. She's trying to be nice. But it's making it impossible. It's already so hard to keep track of traffic flow and now she's  adding this weird stressful layer instead of simply turning right. And now I'm going, and stopping, and going, and braking, on repeat, and am stuck in the street. Now cars are honking behind me, and also on sides of me. I can't turn and I can't stay put. Finally my mom turns right, with my daughter waving sweetly from the back seat. I turn left, finally. \n\nI am literally shaking and realize after coming out of my fugue state that I've been screaming \"Go! Mom! Fucking GO, Jesus CHRIST!\" with my 7 year old, her grandchild, in the back seat. Also my other child and my mom also probably saw.\n\nI never intentionally swear in front of them and definitely try not to lose my gd mind in front of them. But I did, and am pretty sure my daughter will tell her grandma all about it, if my mom couldn't see my reaction already. Sorry Mom. :(\n\nTL;DR: My mom tried to be nice and almost got us all killed so I accidentally yelled at her in front of her grandchild.\n\n",

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;School pickup is a dangerous mess of cars going too fast from one million different lanes, and families trying to cross a busy road on top of it. Every day I&amp;#39;m trying not to cause or be offed by a car wreck and also not accidentally run down a family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I picked up one kid from school and my mom picked up the other. I was leaving from one parking lot with one kid in my car, and my mom, from the lot across the busy street with my other kid in her car. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I say this with love and also frustration: my mom is someone who will make the simplest tasks infinitely difficult by trying to guess what the other person will want, and bending over backwards to try and make it easier for them. Except it always makes it harder. Every time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there we were, my mom and I, two cars waiting to turn across a busy four lane street. Cars flying by. People walking everywhere. Cars waiting behind me, for me to turn. I see my mom across the way. She needs to turn right so then I can turn left, as is the way of traffic rules. And turning right is pretty easy! But she won&amp;#39;t do it, because she&amp;#39;s waiting for me to turn left, which is very hard. She&amp;#39;s trying to be nice. But it&amp;#39;s making it impossible. It&amp;#39;s already so hard to keep track of traffic flow and now she&amp;#39;s  adding this weird stressful layer instead of simply turning right. And now I&amp;#39;m going, and stopping, and going, and braking, on repeat, and am stuck in the street. Now cars are honking behind me, and also on sides of me. I can&amp;#39;t turn and I can&amp;#39;t stay put. Finally my mom turns right, with my daughter waving sweetly from the back seat. I turn left, finally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am literally shaking and realize after coming out of my fugue state that I&amp;#39;ve been screaming &amp;quot;Go! Mom! Fucking GO, Jesus CHRIST!&amp;quot; with my 7 year old, her grandchild, in the back seat. Also my other child and my mom also probably saw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never intentionally swear in front of them and definitely try not to lose my gd mind in front of them. But I did, and am pretty sure my daughter will tell her grandma all about it, if my mom couldn&amp;#39;t see my reaction already. Sorry Mom. :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: My mom tried to be nice and almost got us all killed so I accidentally yelled at her in front of her grandchild.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "The last week I've been wanting to tell him. We live together. I tried to pretend everything is okay cuz I want it to be and I was trying to budget to fix it. But it's as if the universe didnt want me to and kept throwing more shit at me. Everything is expensive. Like pet bills, groceries, gas, etc. Living in Cali is no joke. Can't even find a decent home with a good price anymore. Anyways, last week I couldn't stop looking at the numbers adding up. I wanted him to know but I was truly scared to ask for any kind of help. I didn't want him to be angry or disappointed in me for letting it get that way. At one point I was so close to fixing it. I was so happy. But when we moved the number ended up doubling. The vet was $380 just for shots. We had to buy some furniture so I actually had savings and that's where that went. Had to pay gas for the house. I pay for a specific medication. I never used the credit card for those things tho. It was groceries after I paid everything else off. He likes to have friends stay the weekend. I can't help but feel I need to have enough food to feed everyone. I hate asking for help. As a kid I wasn't allowed to ask for anything. And if I did it was always no with some yelling from my dad. My mom would use me for money or anything she could gets her hands on. Parents are divorced. I guess it became a bad habit to want to do it myself. But I didn't want to hurt my love when we are trying to save for our future. He discovered it yesterday. We lay on the bed picking on each other's and having some laughs. He grabbed my phone like he does once in a while to see what I like to search (like naughty things). He immediately saw my bank account when he opened my phone. We talked for 3 hours before I left for work about it. I understand why he is distraught and thrown aback. I lied to him about being okay when I wasn't and now I get to feel the betrayal that I forced upon him. I feel like a terrible person right now. He wants to help me with it little by little over the next few months. I ruined his birthday and Christmas. I'm a piece of shit. I didn't want his help with this. I didn't want to ruin anything for him and I am still surprised he hasn't left me yet. I can't even handle money well nor can I even ask for a hand when I need it before the situation gets worse. Why would anyone want a woman like that? I wish I would've said something sooner. I wanted to. But I let my emotions and past experiences take hold instead. He's not going to trust me for a long time and I both understand and expect that. Trust is the foundation of a relationship and I broke it severely into millions of pieces. I love him. I'd do anything for him. But I fucked up bad and I deserve everything else that either comes my way or doesn't next.\n\nTL;DR: I lied to my boyfriend of 5 years about my debt problem and he found out.",

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last week I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to tell him. We live together. I tried to pretend everything is okay cuz I want it to be and I was trying to budget to fix it. But it&amp;#39;s as if the universe didnt want me to and kept throwing more shit at me. Everything is expensive. Like pet bills, groceries, gas, etc. Living in Cali is no joke. Can&amp;#39;t even find a decent home with a good price anymore. Anyways, last week I couldn&amp;#39;t stop looking at the numbers adding up. I wanted him to know but I was truly scared to ask for any kind of help. I didn&amp;#39;t want him to be angry or disappointed in me for letting it get that way. At one point I was so close to fixing it. I was so happy. But when we moved the number ended up doubling. The vet was $380 just for shots. We had to buy some furniture so I actually had savings and that&amp;#39;s where that went. Had to pay gas for the house. I pay for a specific medication. I never used the credit card for those things tho. It was groceries after I paid everything else off. He likes to have friends stay the weekend. I can&amp;#39;t help but feel I need to have enough food to feed everyone. I hate asking for help. As a kid I wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to ask for anything. And if I did it was always no with some yelling from my dad. My mom would use me for money or anything she could gets her hands on. Parents are divorced. I guess it became a bad habit to want to do it myself. But I didn&amp;#39;t want to hurt my love when we are trying to save for our future. He discovered it yesterday. We lay on the bed picking on each other&amp;#39;s and having some laughs. He grabbed my phone like he does once in a while to see what I like to search (like naughty things). He immediately saw my bank account when he opened my phone. We talked for 3 hours before I left for work about it. I understand why he is distraught and thrown aback. I lied to him about being okay when I wasn&amp;#39;t and now I get to feel the betrayal that I forced upon him. I feel like a terrible person right now. He wants to help me with it little by little over the next few months. I ruined his birthday and Christmas. I&amp;#39;m a piece of shit. I didn&amp;#39;t want his help with this. I didn&amp;#39;t want to ruin anything for him and I am still surprised he hasn&amp;#39;t left me yet. I can&amp;#39;t even handle money well nor can I even ask for a hand when I need it before the situation gets worse. Why would anyone want a woman like that? I wish I would&amp;#39;ve said something sooner. I wanted to. But I let my emotions and past experiences take hold instead. He&amp;#39;s not going to trust me for a long time and I both understand and expect that. Trust is the foundation of a relationship and I broke it severely into millions of pieces. I love him. I&amp;#39;d do anything for him. But I fucked up bad and I deserve everything else that either comes my way or doesn&amp;#39;t next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I lied to my boyfriend of 5 years about my debt problem and he found out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My mother reads these posts and she damn near had a heart attack (likely from her cigarette habit).\n\nTo those of you concerned about my daily diarrhea dungeon, the encounter has been bludgeoned. Since that fateful Saturday, it's been rainbows and flowers, bees all over every hour. \n\nTo the one person that called me a slob, you have 300,000+ comment karma, get off your soapbox, most likely still packaged because you don't shower. \n\nI do not have a scat fetish, but the feeling of a waterfall coming out of my anus is like no other. The person that wanted to see my soiled boxers is the candidate with a scat fetish.\n\nI have gone to the doctor, they gave me a finger up the bum bum and the results came back.\n\nI have the *finest* poo chute on the planet. They told me they have never had anyone come in with concerns and be more fine than me.\n\nI have the BEST arsehole on the planet. I will scream it from the rooftops. \n\nNow, my girlfriend did tell me stop eating the pineapple (yes I have a girlfriend rare for someone with a reddit account to obtain such a thing) it was a long 2 days of no orgasmic citrus goodness, but it was needed. I mentioned I had a blockage southeast, now this one was scary. I measured it, 8\" diameter and my asshole felt like it was gonna fall out but I prospered and didn't even need the poop knife. \n\nTo the pineapple haters, our leaders will find you\n\nTo the pineapple people, join us. We will conquer the world. \n\nAnd by pineapple people I don't mean swingers when I first heard of swingers I thought it was people that enjoyed saucer swings\n\n\nTL;DR: \nI ate lots of pineapple and had a bloody ass hole and now I'm good\n\n",

    "selftext": "TW: sexual harassment\n\n  I (23f) have lived with my cousin Rose and her husband Dumbo (both 33) for over a year for economical reasons. We have had a lot of issues but I could handle them. 6 months ago I began to realize that Dumbo was looking at me more. I've always been sure to wear appropriate clothing in front of him and I've never even been without a bra outside of my room. Even so I noticed that his eyes were going to other places constantly like my boobs, ass or more below. I thought that it was just my imagination but just in case I started wearing around the house oversized hoodies and sweatpants and nothing body fitting, but I stilled noticed that when we would have conversations he would deliberately stare at other places. One night as I was lying on the couch laughing at a video on my phone he came up to me, asked what I was laughing at and before I could answer he bent down and put his head on my boobs at an angle he could look at the phone screen. I was in shock and I am ashamed that I just let it happen. That's when I knew I had to tell someone, especially my parents, but I didn't have the courage, so I stuck it out. \n\n   More comments were made but the one that disgusted me the most was when he said \"hey, is it me or have your boobs gotten bigger?\" I asked why the F he was looking at me that way and that he was so off for that but he just laughed. I got the courage to tell my stepmom and dad and they were both shocked. They said that I needed to move out ASAP, and that I also needed to talk to Rose about Dumbo's behavior and I would also need to talk to Dumbo. It took a bit of pushing but I finally got the nerve to sit down with Rose and tell her everything that had happened and this was the reason I was moving. She said that she would talk to him but in the end this was my problem with him and I needed to fix it. I thought that after she spoke  to him he would come to me and apologize or say something at least, but that never happened. 2 days after I told Rose that I was expecting an apology on his behalf, and I was going to talk to him myself about everything. She said that would be useless because he said he was never going to talk to me again as he claims he did nothing and apologizing would mean him owning up to what I claimed happened, that both of them were going to wait until my dad was back in town so he could solve everything. He claims that I am just trying to put my family against him and ruin his reputation. I left to go to work after that, but in my mental state I forgot something and when I came back I caught her talking to her mom them talking about how they didn't believe anything I had said and that the three of them would tell my parents that I'm trying to divide the family. With three people ganging up against me I am worried that they'll manage to change my parents mind. I think I fucked up by bringing this whole thing up, I may have just ruined my whole relationship with everyone, possibly ruined a marriage, and in the end I'm starting to even doubt my own judgment on what could have just been a misunderstanding. I fucked up by not staying quiet. \n\nI'll update if its requested. \n\nTL;DR: I fucked up by telling my cousin and my family that her husband has been inappropriate towards me, my cousin and her husband are now trying to convince everyone that i am a liar, I may have just fucked up my relationship with my whole family.",

That&amp;#39;s when I knew I had to tell someone, especially my parents, but I didn&amp;#39;t have the courage, so I stuck it out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More comments were made but the one that disgusted me the most was when he said &amp;quot;hey, is it me or have your boobs gotten bigger?&amp;quot; I asked why the F he was looking at me that way and that he was so off for that but he just laughed. I got the courage to tell my stepmom and dad and they were both shocked. They said that I needed to move out ASAP, and that I also needed to talk to Rose about Dumbo&amp;#39;s behavior and I would also need to talk to Dumbo. It took a bit of pushing but I finally got the nerve to sit down with Rose and tell her everything that had happened and this was the reason I was moving. She said that she would talk to him but in the end this was my problem with him and I needed to fix it. I thought that after she spoke  to him he would come to me and apologize or say something at least, but that never happened. 2 days after I told Rose that I was expecting an apology on his behalf, and I was going to talk to him myself about everything. She said that would be useless because he said he was never going to talk to me again as he claims he did nothing and apologizing would mean him owning up to what I claimed happened, that both of them were going to wait until my dad was back in town so he could solve everything. He claims that I am just trying to put my family against him and ruin his reputation. I left to go to work after that, but in my mental state I forgot something and when I came back I caught her talking to her mom them talking about how they didn&amp;#39;t believe anything I had said and that the three of them would tell my parents that I&amp;#39;m trying to divide the family. With three people ganging up against me I am worried that they&amp;#39;ll manage to change my parents mind. I think I fucked up by bringing this whole thing up, I may have just ruined my whole relationship with everyone, possibly ruined a marriage, and in the end I&amp;#39;m starting to even doubt my own judgment on what could have just been a misunderstanding. I fucked up by not staying quiet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll update if its requested. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I fucked up by telling my cousin and my family that her husband has been inappropriate towards me, my cousin and her husband are now trying to convince everyone that i am a liar, I may have just fucked up my relationship with my whole family.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I went to the doctor several times and it came back every time. Tried the duct tape method, tried using over the counter freezing methods. Nothing worked so I resorted to drastic measures. \n\nThe doctor used a special knife to cut it out before so I thought how hard could it be?\n\nSo I started cutting it. It was successful surprisingly. I ended up doing the same thing every few weeks without any issue to keep the monster at bay. \n\nMy instrument of choice was a Leatherman Wave knife. It's a knife on a multitool, and it was my sharpest blade. A pointy knife. \n\nThen one day I'm about to start my wart cutting routine, I already had the knife open and I just wanted to scoot a bit more toward the edge of my bed. My current position was with the wart foot propped up on the bed with my other leg in a normal sitting position. When I scooted forward my wart foot went straight up into the blade about a half inch into the bottom of my foot. \n\nYou know when you hurt yourself and you know it's bad? IYKYK.

    "selftext": "I have only knowingly seen 2 people in my life drunk and how they act. My Mom is more serious but turns into a ball of laughter when she\u2019s drunk or she sleeps very quickly after. One of my aunts is very touchy and loud and her personality is doubled but with laughter as well when alcohol is involved. With that logic my sister thought she would be a laughing drunk as well. I tried it a few times and I was about to throw up over one drop while my sister was chugging it like a pro. Each time It was less than a spoon full. \n\nNow onto the story, my sister recently moved to college and when I was at my first homecoming as a senior she and my mom missed it and they were very upset, I wasn\u2019t mad at them because they had valid reasons. My Mother is in the Navy/Military and was overseas for a few weeks during the time, my sisters college requires a train to get back home and when I first went with her that was my first time riding one that I remember, so it would be very inconvenient for her to come over here without a good reason. My Step Dad helped me pick out a suit and called my Mom to be involved with the process.\n\nDuring homecoming I had fun but my phone was about to lock because my mom has a parental control on my phone until I go to college. (7am-10pm for those curious) During the limit i cant contact people that aren\u2019t my Mom or sister. My grandmother is staying over so I can have a guardian, i didn\u2019t want her to have my number for personal reasons so I never considered her being a contact after 10pm. Well I was taking a photo and got an alert for 5 minutes left. I contacted my grandmother and explained I needed her to pick me up a little early and the screen time. I tried contacting my sister but I got no reply until I got home. \u201cSorry I drunk\u201d I started making joke texts to mess with her pretending I was drunk. Later she showed me a video of her roommates looking mad as hell while my sister was crying talking about how everyone thinks she\u2019s fat (she\u2019s not), and rambling about nonsense, We laughed until later on. She asked me about who I\u2019m inviting to my graduation and I said a few people that came to mind, she said \u201cWow not me huh?\u201d. I didn\u2019t say her name because In my mind she was by default on my list so I didn\u2019t think about saying it for some reason. I told her my thought process and apologized then she got happy. I only told 3 people so far who I want at my graduation.\n\nDuring a phone call, she wanted to see my graduation photo because I was complaining about my eyes looking crossed and squinted because of the bright ass light they had. I send her the photo the next night and I get called immediately after, she is bawling her eyes out and saying \u201cWhy did you show me that\u201d She says how she doesn\u2019t want to miss my graduation like she missed my homecoming, her roommate grabs her phone and explains how he tried to get her to drink water because she drunk an entire bottle of alcohol and how he\u2019s never drinking with her again, he was one of the people who previously drunk with her. He was the only sane one. He gave me a 360 view of the room, my sister crying while chris cross apple sauce, a dude screaming to the top of his lungs randomly, 2 people cuddling, all while on the floor no blanket mind you, and I hear someone else crying, He then gives the phone back to my sister. I tell her how she needs to drink water but she doesn\u2019t listen and the entire conversation is going in circles, then the random dude screams again and I lose my shit laughing because I can\u2019t take this seriously anymore. Before she hangs up she gets very close to the camera and says \u201cYou were an annoying ass little shit growing up but your my shit\u2026my shit\u2026\u201d She then started praising me for how far I had come because I was genuinely an annoying kid growing up. (I don\u2019t disagree), she gave me some of the nicest compliments I ever heard her say like how she\u2019s proud that I\u2019m her little brother. I also recorded some of it to show my sister but I couldn\u2019t catch the audio since I fucked it up but I did catch the 360 view the roommate gave me. I told her I would talk to her in the morning when she was sober. I took the saying \u201cdrunk words are sober thoughts\u201d into consideration. She asked me if I was sad that I had my senior year just started and my mom missed my first day, nobody came to homecoming, they might miss graduation, and how she hates how people keep missing my events.\n\nThe next morning I called her and the first thing I asked her was if she remembered the night before, she knew she was crying and what caused it but didn\u2019t know the details. Me and her roommate took great pleasure in informing her because a lot more did happen, I asked if she was genuinely worried and upset about not going to my homecoming and possibly my graduation. She confirmed that she was worried about it and to the best of my ability I tried to comfort her, I told her \u201cI don\u2019t know if you are more upset about disappointing me by not showing up, or if it\u2019s something else but I promise I won\u2019t hold it against you if you have a legitimate reason for not being able to go like an emergency or exam but I do want you there if possible.\u201d My birthday is in the same week that I graduate so even if she misses it we can hold an event shortly after. We then went back to laughing while watching drunk clips of her and I saw her mood was better after.\n\nTo end on a lighter note The people in the room actually started commenting when my sister started complimenting me about it how much I grown while she was bawling her eyes out the night before. This is how it went-\n\n(Group at once): \u201cawwwww\u201d\n\n(Some guy): \u201cDamn you old as shit Unc\u201d\n\n(Sister): \u201cALL YALL NEED TO SHUT UP!\u201d\n\nTLDR: Showed my sister my graduation photos in advance. I was previously ranting about how my eyes were either squinting or looked crossed eyes because of the light. I don\u2019t know she was drunk at the time. So she called me crying for half an hour and told me all her fears about missing my graduation and homecoming that the photo sparked.\n\n",

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have only knowingly seen 2 people in my life drunk and how they act. My Mom is more serious but turns into a ball of laughter when she\u2019s drunk or she sleeps very quickly after. One of my aunts is very touchy and loud and her personality is doubled but with laughter as well when alcohol is involved. With that logic my sister thought she would be a laughing drunk as well. I tried it a few times and I was about to throw up over one drop while my sister was chugging it like a pro. Each time It was less than a spoon full. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now onto the story, my sister recently moved to college and when I was at my first homecoming as a senior she and my mom missed it and they were very upset, I wasn\u2019t mad at them because they had valid reasons. My Mother is in the Navy/Military and was overseas for a few weeks during the time, my sisters college requires a train to get back home and when I first went with her that was my first time riding one that I remember, so it would be very inconvenient for her to come over here without a good reason. My Step Dad helped me pick out a suit and called my Mom to be involved with the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During homecoming I had fun but my phone was about to lock because my mom has a parental control on my phone until I go to college. (7am-10pm for those curious) During the limit i cant contact people that aren\u2019t my Mom or sister. My grandmother is staying over so I can have a guardian, i didn\u2019t want her to have my number for personal reasons so I never considered her being a contact after 10pm. Well I was taking a photo and got an alert for 5 minutes left. I contacted my grandmother and explained I needed her to pick me up a little early and the screen time. I tried contacting my sister but I got no reply until I got home. \u201cSorry I drunk\u201d I started making joke texts to mess with her pretending I was drunk. Later she showed me a video of her roommates looking mad as hell while my sister was crying talking about how everyone thinks she\u2019s fat (she\u2019s not), and rambling about nonsense, We laughed until later on. She asked me about who I\u2019m inviting to my graduation and I said a few people that came to mind, she said \u201cWow not me huh?\u201d. I didn\u2019t say her name because In my mind she was by default on my list so I didn\u2019t think about saying it for some reason. I told her my thought process and apologized then she got happy. I only told 3 people so far who I want at my graduation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During a phone call, she wanted to see my graduation photo because I was complaining about my eyes looking crossed and squinted because of the bright ass light they had. I send her the photo the next night and I get called immediately after, she is bawling her eyes out and saying \u201cWhy did you show me that\u201d She says how she doesn\u2019t want to miss my graduation like she missed my homecoming, her roommate grabs her phone and explains how he tried to get her to drink water because she drunk an entire bottle of alcohol and how he\u2019s never drinking with her again, he was one of the people who previously drunk with her. He was the only sane one. He gave me a 360 view of the room, my sister crying while chris cross apple sauce, a dude screaming to the top of his lungs randomly, 2 people cuddling, all while on the floor no blanket mind you, and I hear someone else crying, He then gives the phone back to my sister. I tell her how she needs to drink water but she doesn\u2019t listen and the entire conversation is going in circles, then the random dude screams again and I lose my shit laughing because I can\u2019t take this seriously anymore. Before she hangs up she gets very close to the camera and says \u201cYou were an annoying ass little shit growing up but your my shit\u2026my shit\u2026\u201d She then started praising me for how far I had come because I was genuinely an annoying kid growing up.

    "selftext": "Obligatory this happened last week. \n\nI (22F), had gained some weight this past summer and I decided to get healthier. Part of this was to start going to the gym. My boyfriend (20M) has been really into fitness for the last year or two and he said he could help me out and show me what to do. \n\nAnother important part of this story is that we didn\u2019t actually have a membership for this gym. We are both in college and my bf\u2019s friend has a membership and he let us take a picture of it to scan in. Perhaps what happened next was karma and I definitely learned my lesson. This was also my first (and last) time going to this gym, so overall I was pretty nervous.\n\nWe get to the gym and the idea is that I copy my boyfriend\u2019s first 3 exercises and then walk on the treadmill until he finishes his workout. It is also important to note that I hadn\u2019t done a real workout in around 6-8 months. Each exercise is 3-4 sets of 8 reps. We were doing arms so we did lat pull downs and two other machines that I don\u2019t remember.\n\nThroughout the whole exercises portion I am feeling pretty good. The preworkout is coursing through my veins and I feel amazing. I also forgot to drink or eat much that day which is important. By the third exercise I\u2019m feeling pretty tired but I push through. Since we worked out arms I feel fine to walk in the treadmill for a while and watch family guy.\n\nI get on the treadmill and start walking for around a minute. But my playlist was so good I just felt like jogging. I\u2019m jogging at around 5-6 m.p.h for like 3 minutes when suddenly I don\u2019t feel so good. I frantically try to stop the treadmill and at the same time dramatically vomit 5 times in a row onto the treadmill.  My boyfriend says when I throw up it sounds like a cartoon vomiting like super loud and dramatic. The vomit is everywhere and everyone is staring at me, except apparently, my boyfriend who was on the other side of the gym and didn\u2019t notice. There is like a 10 second pause where everyone stares and then I vomit 5 times again.\n\nOne of the ladies who works at the gym came over and I was like I\u2019m so sorry and she was like \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it. Go to the bathroom and clean yourself up\u201d. But internally(and externally) I\u2019m freaking out because we don\u2019t have a membership there. I\u2019m both nervous they would check that and I feel horrible that I threw up without even paying to go there. I tried to put like a few paper towels on it but I honestly was panicking and didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nInstead of going to the locker room I frantically run across the gym to my boyfriend, who did not notice any of this happening, and explain to him that we need to leave immediately. Once we get in the car, he almost throws up because I smell so bad so I had to attempt to clean myself up at a random gas station. I haven\u2019t been back to that gym (or any gym tbh) since, and when I do go back to a gym I will definitely be buying a membership.\n\nThe one benefit from this whole situation is that me and my boyfriend have started going on daily walks, which have been really nice.\n\nTL;DR : I went to a gym I didn\u2019t have a membership at and proceeded to vomit all over the place.",

I acted like a little bit of a slut but it was only because the guys were too. I flirted and I joked about being single. We were all drinking so a lot of the details are a little fuzzy but I was eventually dared by one of the guys to give another one a mama bird shot. If you don\u2019t know what that is it\u2019s just spitting a shot into someone else\u2019s mouth. It\u2019s really gross but we were drunk. I did it and the guy enjoyed it a lot.\nEventually after a few of those and lots of encouragement from our friends our friends shoved us into his bedroom. We made out for like 15 minutes. Before he shoved me onto the bed and initiated the sex. It was the best sex I\u2019ve ever had. When we were done his mom ended up being downstairs with all of our friends. He got in trouble obviously. \nLater I was sitting playing uno with our friends and his mom came downstairs and asked where I was sleeping and genuinely not knowing I just shrugged and said \u201cwherever I drop I guess\u201d and she told me to sleep in his bed so I thought I was in the clear. \nThe next day everything seemed fine. He got up for work and gave me a kiss goodbye. I packed up to go home and we left. I texted him a little bit and he said that it was a one night thing. I completely understood but continued talking to him just as a friend. \nLast night everything blew up. He texted me that \u201cno offense but you\u2019re not my type\u201d and when I was a little upset because that came completely out of left field, I texted my best friend. She told me that he regrets it. Understandable, me too. And then insinuated that he\u2019s telling people I raped him. His friends were texting me asking if I\u2019m clean. I am. He\u2019s the only one night stand over ever had. I\u2019ve seen every one of my ex\u2019s std charts. I would have an updated std chart to share with them but the last time I went to the doctor they lost my pee. The friends seem pissed while they\u2019re texting me. Another one of our friends is telling my best friend (I\u2019m hearing most of this through my best friend because apparently nobody will text me directly) that I tried to sleep with another one of our friends while we played uno. I was sitting close to him because I wasn\u2019t playing and he proposed we be a team. \nThis all just blew up out of control and I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t wanna lose all of these friends but I know I have. \nTl;dr- I fucked up by having a one night stand and now things are blowing out of control.",

I&amp;#39;ve since tired to explain my mistake and edited the post but this feels like one of those moments I&amp;#39;m going to think about for the rest of my life as I&amp;#39;m trying to sleep at night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR : trans autocorrected to transformers on a post I made and I didn&amp;#39;t realise until people thought I was being openly transphobic. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

As the title says, I was playing a porn game, ya know, hormones and stuff, when my sister messaged me on discord with a screenshot of me playing it, asking what tf it was. She's asleep right now, I'm out here scrambling for an excuse.\n\nTo make matters worse, it's not a one and done thing. It's not obviously a porn game, but it is a FURRY porn game, so the Discord rpc shows a screenshot of a very lewd furry character.\n\nI don't do this often, but I figured it was late, why not?

    "selftext": "So... I made a mistake. I decided to have a late night snack after work. This late night snack involved cutting a jalape\u00f1o. After eating said snack I was ready for bed and started my bedtime routine, rubbing my eyes to get me into bedtime mode. Apparently I forgot that I was handling a jalape\u00f1o 5 minutes ago. Suddenly my eyes were in absolute pain and I had no idea why, it hadn't dawned on me what I had done. \n\nSo spicy tears are running down my face and my whole face is on fire now. What do I do? I grab my makeup remover cloth and quickly get it wet and start scrubbing at my eyes to get this god-awful pain to go away. Except guess what. My hands still had jalape\u00f1o juice on them. The wet cloth was the perfect way to transfer even more pain to my face after sucking in the spice.\n\n When I finally realized what was going on I tossed the rag away and just stood in my bathroom silently crying so my parents wouldn't hear me . But I still had the juice on my hands, I would have to go to the kitchen to use the dish soap. In shame I walked out to tell my parents what a dumbass I am, with swollen eyes and spicy tears still flowing. But we had just enough dish soap for me to get the jalape\u00f1o (hopefully) off. I am too afraid to test that though. So yeah, lesson learned. Wash your hands very well after touching spicy things, don't let sleepy brain take over and forget things.\n\nEdit: I should add that I have learned this lesson before but it was not my eyes that were touched. I was just sleepy after a long work day and forgot to wash my hands like I usually do.\n\n\nTL;DR I cut up a jalape\u00f1o, promptly forgot, and started rubbing my eyes which resulted in ungodly pain and spicy tears to bring the pain to the rest of my face. Remember to wash your hands (even if you're super tired). :)",

This late night snack involved cutting a jalape\u00f1o. After eating said snack I was ready for bed and started my bedtime routine, rubbing my eyes to get me into bedtime mode. Apparently I forgot that I was handling a jalape\u00f1o 5 minutes ago. Suddenly my eyes were in absolute pain and I had no idea why, it hadn&amp;#39;t dawned on me what I had done. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So spicy tears are running down my face and my whole face is on fire now. What do I do? I grab my makeup remover cloth and quickly get it wet and start scrubbing at my eyes to get this god-awful pain to go away. Except guess what. My hands still had jalape\u00f1o juice on them. The wet cloth was the perfect way to transfer even more pain to my face after sucking in the spice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I finally realized what was going on I tossed the rag away and just stood in my bathroom silently crying so my parents wouldn&amp;#39;t hear me . But I still had the juice on my hands, I would have to go to the kitchen to use the dish soap. In shame I walked out to tell my parents what a dumbass I am, with swollen eyes and spicy tears still flowing. But we had just enough dish soap for me to get the jalape\u00f1o (hopefully) off. I am too afraid to test that though. So yeah, lesson learned. Wash your hands very well after touching spicy things, don&amp;#39;t let sleepy brain take over and forget things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I should add that I have learned this lesson before but it was not my eyes that were touched. I was just sleepy after a long work day and forgot to wash my hands like I usually do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I cut up a jalape\u00f1o, promptly forgot, and started rubbing my eyes which resulted in ungodly pain and spicy tears to bring the pain to the rest of my face. Remember to wash your hands (even if you&amp;#39;re super tired). :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "I've had vericose veins in my leg since my early 20s, I'm in my mid 40s now. My new primary care doctor was concerned about them because of a spot on my ankle that she thought was caused by the veins. She convinced me to take a referral to a vascular surgeon. \n\nI met with the VS who told me how much better my life could be if I had the veins addressed. They told me how bad the flow was in those veins. They said they used to do a painful procedure to basically rip the veins out. However, now they had a procedure where they run something up the vein and burn it with a laser. \n\nThey assured me I would be fine after a day or two. It wasn't a difficult surgery or recovery, and that I would be able to return to work the day after the surgery.  \n\nTo be clear, I'm not some wimp when it comes to pain. I had MACI knee surgery on the same leg a little over two years ago. This surgery they were suggesting should be nothing compared to that. \n\nSo Friday morning I had the surgery. I was pretty okay Friday for the most part. Saturday I was a little sore, but still went to work. Sunday was more pain, I missed work, and tried to take a day to take care of myself. Then this morning I got woke up by severe pain about 4AM. It's been severe pain all day. The doctor had prescribed me pain pills. After my MACI I took one, felt sick, never took another. I just sucked it up and dealt with the pain. Today I've taken 5 of the hydrocodone they prescribed, and still can't walk without a crutch. I missed work again today, something I never do. \n\nIt's put me in such severe pain that I called the doctor's office to see if they could see me sooner. The doctor's office then informs me that what I'm going through is often normal, nothing to worry about, and to keep my leg elevated and move around as much as I can. That I just need to get through it.  I wasn't very nice because of the severe pain, I'm not trying to be rude it is just hard. I said, the doctor said one or two days at most. They then told me when the veins are really bad like mine were(a nurse the day of surgery said mine were the worst she's ever seen) this isn't unusual.  Basically they told me to suck it up and not be a wimp. So now I get to enjoy the worst physical pain of my life until it just finally is over, hopefully soon. The doctor is now waiting 5-7 days.\n\nTo top that off. If I want an appointment before my scheduled follow up this coming Friday they want me to get another ultrasound of my leg. A leg that hurts severely over a light touch. There is no way in hell I'm letting them push that little wand into my leg, I would probably pass out from pain. \n\nTLDR - TIFU by listening to a doctor to get an elective procedure they said would be pretty easy with two day recovery at most. Now I'm sitting here, 4 days later, in the worst pain of my life, wishing they would just cut my leg off, doped up on hydrocodone that makes me feel sick to my stomach, wishing it were just over, but realizing I've still probably got 2-3 more days of hell.

    "selftext": "My ex-girlfriend (f 22) recently broke up with me(m 24), and it\u2019s been hard to process. She ended things because I kept promising I\u2019d get a part-time job but never followed through. I really wanted to do it, for her and for myself, but I was dealing with depression and never really addressed it. I kept pushing it aside, thinking I could manage, but deep down, I wasn\u2019t okay. I\u2019ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts since January, and she was the one thing that brought me happiness during those dark times. Without her, it\u2019s been hard to feel grounded.\n\nShe\u2019s from Volendam, a village in the Netherlands where working is part of the culture. Even students are expected to hold part-time jobs, and people who don\u2019t work are often judged harshly. Her friends and family liked me, but they always asked her what I did. The truth is, I\u2019m a full-time student, working through my second internship and spending most weekends studying 3D art. I needed that time to develop my skills if I wanted to build a future in the industry. Still, I often felt guilty when she worked on Sundays while I stayed home studying.\n\nI loved her deeply and wanted to give her everything, but every week I felt drained\u2014too tired to work a part-time job on top of everything else. She grew tired of my empty promises, and eventually, she decided she couldn\u2019t see a future with me. She told me she still loved me and that I had set a high standard for anyone else she dates, but that wasn\u2019t enough for her to stay.\n\nI\u2019m in my final year of college, and I had always planned to get a full-time job after graduation. At the time, I was struggling with my mental health and feeling stuck, not really sure how to balance everything. After the breakup, it hit me hard, but I also realized I needed to make changes. I\u2019ve since gotten a part-time job, and I\u2019ve started therapy. I want to become a better person, not just for her but for myself.\n\nShe made me want to be better, and I\u2019m grateful for that. If she hadn\u2019t ended things, I think I would\u2019ve kept going without addressing my depression, letting it weigh me down even more.

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My ex-girlfriend (f 22) recently broke up with me(m 24), and it\u2019s been hard to process. She ended things because I kept promising I\u2019d get a part-time job but never followed through. I really wanted to do it, for her and for myself, but I was dealing with depression and never really addressed it. I kept pushing it aside, thinking I could manage, but deep down, I wasn\u2019t okay. I\u2019ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts since January, and she was the one thing that brought me happiness during those dark times. Without her, it\u2019s been hard to feel grounded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She\u2019s from Volendam, a village in the Netherlands where working is part of the culture. Even students are expected to hold part-time jobs, and people who don\u2019t work are often judged harshly. Her friends and family liked me, but they always asked her what I did. The truth is, I\u2019m a full-time student, working through my second internship and spending most weekends studying 3D art. I needed that time to develop my skills if I wanted to build a future in the industry. Still, I often felt guilty when she worked on Sundays while I stayed home studying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I loved her deeply and wanted to give her everything, but every week I felt drained\u2014too tired to work a part-time job on top of everything else. She grew tired of my empty promises, and eventually, she decided she couldn\u2019t see a future with me. She told me she still loved me and that I had set a high standard for anyone else she dates, but that wasn\u2019t enough for her to stay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m in my final year of college, and I had always planned to get a full-time job after graduation. At the time, I was struggling with my mental health and feeling stuck, not really sure how to balance everything. After the breakup, it hit me hard, but I also realized I needed to make changes. I\u2019ve since gotten a part-time job, and I\u2019ve started therapy. I want to become a better person, not just for her but for myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She made me want to be better, and I\u2019m grateful for that. If she hadn\u2019t ended things, I think I would\u2019ve kept going without addressing my depression, letting it weigh me down even more. Now, I\u2019m focused on improving myself, even though it hurts to not have her by my side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I miss her, but I know I have to focus on my own growth now. Maybe one day, if I\u2019ve grown enough, she might see things differently. But for now, I\u2019m working on becoming someone I can be proud of, whether or not we ever reconnect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I\u2019m 24, and I\u2019ve been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now.

I asked her which grade it took and she drilled me that it was the green pump (91 in my country). I get home to my city and go to fuel it up - and see a homemade label stuck to the inside of the fuel flap that my Koro made as his memory was slipping \u201cpremium 95\u201d oh shit. Ring my kuikui, ring mechanics and auto parts stores. All of them say nope\u202691 seems about right (\u201cif it runs well it\u2019s likely the right grade\u201d)! my kuikui says \u201cof course he put the wrong label he can\u2019t remember shit\u201d lol. \n\nSo years go by, literal YEARS and every now and again I look at that label and get anxious I\u2019m putting the wrong gas in. Behind the homemade label is an English gas label that says \u201cpremium unleaded only\u201d (implying 95) but the Japanese labels translate to \u201cunleaded only\u201d (implying 91). Owners manual for cefiro are impossible to find online, Maximas for the equivalent say nothing about fuel grades. \n\nThis month I went to the mechanic to get a sound in the engine diagnosed as I\u2019m moving to a different island and just need the peace of mind that what I\u2019m certain is lifter tick is actually just that and nothing more. \n\nMechanic rings me \u201chey yep it\u2019s lifter tick you were right, we just put some additives in which should help.

He suggested I try a tank of it, see how I go on fuel economy and engine performance and decide for myself. \n\nSo I finally did. \n\nDrove that tank to E and filled it with 95 (which is about 40 cents more expensive per litre in my city). And god almighty it drives so well, is so silent and wants to fly down the road now. \n\nThe kicker? Google translate has improved a lot in the last few years and after retranslating the Japanese tags, they said \u201cpremium unleaded\u201d the whole time.

For two years I filled the car with a lower octane fuel than needed without realising. \n\nShout out to the VQ engine for not blowing the fuck up at any point over the last two years.

I have no idea why I like him so much, I have these such intense feelings for him for a year already and found myself in limerance over him. For the past year, ever since we started following each other on insta and liking my insta stories, I couldn't help but everday lurk through his Instagram followings and his LinkedIn account every once in a while. \n\n\n\nTwo days ago, I was playing my music at work but got bored of it, so I asked my crush for a song recommendation and he typed on my Spotify search bar his favorite song. However, it started with the first letter of his initial. I didn't think anything of it until I got home and re typed in that same song again. And when I typed the first letter of his initial, not only did his first name came up right up first but his full name came up multiple times from when I was trying to find out if he had spotify last week so I could check out his Spotify playlist. I'm not sure if he even has Spotify so the fact that his full name came up in my Spotify search bar is wild. After that incident, he just handed back my phone didn't say anything, just continued with his task\u00a0then said bye, and left since his shift was over. I'm not sure if he did see his name appearing on my Spotify since it was the first thing that appeared and if I'm overthinking it, but it's two days later and I'm horrified right now and have no idea how to cope because that was so creepy and woke me up to a reality check to stop lurking him on social media. I'm now terrified to go back to work and don't ever want to face him again. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: I asked my work crush for a song recommendation and allowed him to look up his fav song on my Spotify, however, the song started with the first initial of his name and the first thing that appeared was his full name multiple times. Now he knows that I've been lurking him on social media and I'm horrified to go back to work and see him.",

For the past year, ever since we started following each other on insta and liking my insta stories, I couldn&amp;#39;t help but everday lurk through his Instagram followings and his LinkedIn account every once in a while. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two days ago, I was playing my music at work but got bored of it, so I asked my crush for a song recommendation and he typed on my Spotify search bar his favorite song. However, it started with the first letter of his initial. I didn&amp;#39;t think anything of it until I got home and re typed in that same song again. And when I typed the first letter of his initial, not only did his first name came up right up first but his full name came up multiple times from when I was trying to find out if he had spotify last week so I could check out his Spotify playlist. I&amp;#39;m not sure if he even has Spotify so the fact that his full name came up in my Spotify search bar is wild. After that incident, he just handed back my phone didn&amp;#39;t say anything, just continued with his task\u00a0then said bye, and left since his shift was over. I&amp;#39;m not sure if he did see his name appearing on my Spotify since it was the first thing that appeared and if I&amp;#39;m overthinking it, but it&amp;#39;s two days later and I&amp;#39;m horrified right now and have no idea how to cope because that was so creepy and woke me up to a reality check to stop lurking him on social media. I&amp;#39;m now terrified to go back to work and don&amp;#39;t ever want to face him again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I asked my work crush for a song recommendation and allowed him to look up his fav song on my Spotify, however, the song started with the first initial of his name and the first thing that appeared was his full name multiple times. Now he knows that I&amp;#39;ve been lurking him on social media and I&amp;#39;m horrified to go back to work and see him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "tl;dr:  I stole a LOT of caramel syrup that was stacked up outside a Mcdonald's near my house.  Found out that it's not all that tasty in bulk and doesn't go down a sink without protest.  \n\nSo when I was a teen (not \"today,\") I used to live not far from a McDonald's.  \n  \nI was on the HS swim team, and practices were held at the horrible hour of 5AM.  My parents were less than enthusiastic about dropping me off that early, so I had to get up at 4AM just to bike there.  Cutting through a gap in the fence of the McDonald's store's parking lot saved me a couple of blocks, so I would force my bike through the hedge and go on my sad, lonely way.  \n  \nThere were several days where I'd see huge stacks of buns and other stuff outside the store's side entrance.  I don't know if there was some kind of drop-off from trucks, or daily delivery or whatever.  I suppose (although I never checked) that the delivery was only for non-perishables.  There must have been some other arrangement for things like meat, eggs, produce, etc.  The timing was odd, but maybe the truck had an early route, and that was the first store?  Hard to say.  For reasons that will become obvious, I never asked.  \n  \nOne day, I noticed the stack of supply pallets had a bunch of #10 cans on them.  When I got closer, I saw the label identifying them as the gooey caramel sauce that McDonald's used for their sundays.  I liked that shit.  It was awesome.  It being just after 4:00AM, my brain wasn't working all that well, so I decided I would take one of them with me to school and me and my teammates would eat it with a spoon.  Best day ever!  \n  \nBut then I thought: What if we eat *all* of the syrup?  That would leave none for me when I had ice cream at home.  Who was I to deny my family *their* share of tasty caramel sundays?  Solution:  Zip on home and get something more cargo capable than a tricked-out Schwinn with a banana seat and chopper handlebars.  \n  \nIn all of five minutes, our family's Dodge Dart was loaded down with ten #10 cans of caramel syrup.  I drove it home, made as little noise as I could unloading and hiding the cans, and then booked it back to school on my bike.  \n  \nStealing what was probably a couple of months' worth of sunday topping for a single McDonald's is probably enough to qualify as a FU, but I've found that this subreddit expects consequences, even if they aren't all that consequential.  There were several.    \n  \nThe first thing I realized after successfully pulling off the one and only \"heist\" of my abbreviated criminal career was that you really couldn't open one of those #10 cans without somewhere to put all the stuff inside of it.  I could maybe consume a couple of spoonfulls of caramel syrup at a time.  Any more than that, and it started tasting awful.  Deliciously awful, but still awful.  So that left the problem of what to do with the rest of the syrup.  \n  \nSo on the first day I decided to enjoy the fruits of my juvenile delinquency, I ended up attempting to pour the majority of a #10 can of McDonald's caramel syrup down my family's bathroom sink.  Fun fact: caramel syrup does not go gently into that good night. It clogged up the sink almost immediately, leaving me in the ONE bathroom in our tiny single-family abode with a mostly full #10 ten can of thick vanilla-flavored goodness, a sink filled about 1/3 of the way up with the rest of it, and a growing line of siblings pounding on the door clamoring to get in so they can pee.   \n  \nRunning hot water into the sink only helped a tiny bit.  It diluted the syrup IN the sink but did nothing to unclog what must have been the world's largest Heath Bar lodged in the P-trap under the vanity.  Even the plunger had no effect.  In desperation, I used my cupped hands to transfer as much syrup and brownish sweet water from sink to toilet, flushing as often as the tank would fill up.  \n  \nThe sink mostly emptied, I then attempted to clean up.  But we kept cleaning supplies in the linen closet OUTSIDE of the bathroom, so all I had on hand were towels and toilet paper.  I didn't dare try to use the towels- my mom would have killed me!  So I tried using the toilet paper.  Which is when I learned that caramel syrup sticks to counters, toilet seats, walls, floors, etc. much harder than it sticks to toilet paper.  All I really managed to do was add a layer of Charmin to the mess on every surface between sink and toilet.  \n  \nFinally, faced with a \"Heeeeere's Johnny!\" moment from a pair of angry siblings, I opened the door.  My older brother took one look at the place and said \"holy fuck! What were you doing in here?  Did you shit in the sink?\"  Which, to be fair, was a reasonable first impression for someone seeing brown smears all over sink, counter, and toilet seat.  \n  \nWhich led to my *real* Fuck Up of the day:  I just went with it.  Somehow, it made more sense at the time to confess to blowing out the sink's pipes with an enormous load of feces than to admit that I had stolen a giant can of McDonald's caramel syrup.  Value judgements were not my forte at the time.  \n  \nI don't remember what lame excuse I made.  \"Yeah, the toilet was clogged, so I didn't have any choice,\" I probably said.  And then I grabbed some Formula 409 out of the linen closet and started spraying it everywhere, despite my brothers' increasingly agitated peepee dances.  \n  \nNever the brightest bulbs in the shed, they both accepted my lame explanation, satisfied perhaps with an admission of guilt and the potential for giving me a hard time about shitting in the sink.  Which they did for many decades, often, and with great enthusiasm.  And so I became that one weird cousin who shits in the sink.  \"Don't let /u/Leftunder use your bathroom!  He'll shit in your sink!\" they'd say whenever we visited the aunts &amp; uncles.  Of course, I'd be helpless to defend myself.  \"It was really just a lot of caramel syrup\" would have demanded too much awkward explanation.    \n  \nAnd there was a third, less impactful consequence:  When I bragged about my haul to my closest fellow teenage reprobates, one of them made the astute observation that those #10 cans were probably super expensive.  I forget the math, but we concluded that I had committed the equivalent of grand theft auto in McDonald's caramel syrup.  So instead of getting to enjoy the fruits of my labor, we ended up opening just one more can, each spooning out enough to make us physically ill, and then dumping out the rest in the woods.  Somewhere there is a dynasty of ants worshiping the Divine Provider that poured the manna from heaven that fed their colony for untold generations.  \n  \nOh, and add one more:  After the wake-up call of realizing I had committed a felony, I decided that cutting through the McDonald's parking lot wasn't a good idea, nor was being noticed as the one guy riding a bike at 4:30AM every day.  The ace detective they assigned to solve the Great Syrup Caper of 1978 would surely put 2&amp;2 together, and all it would take is one blood sugar reading to prove my guilt.  So I quit the swim team.  Which wasn't all that big of a deal since I was a shitty swimmer and actually hated getting up that early anyway.",

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;tl;dr:  I stole a LOT of caramel syrup that was stacked up outside a Mcdonald&amp;#39;s near my house.  Found out that it&amp;#39;s not all that tasty in bulk and doesn&amp;#39;t go down a sink without protest.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when I was a teen (not &amp;quot;today,&amp;quot;) I used to live not far from a McDonald&amp;#39;s.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was on the HS swim team, and practices were held at the horrible hour of 5AM.  My parents were less than enthusiastic about dropping me off that early, so I had to get up at 4AM just to bike there.  Cutting through a gap in the fence of the McDonald&amp;#39;s store&amp;#39;s parking lot saved me a couple of blocks, so I would force my bike through the hedge and go on my sad, lonely way.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were several days where I&amp;#39;d see huge stacks of buns and other stuff outside the store&amp;#39;s side entrance.  I don&amp;#39;t know if there was some kind of drop-off from trucks, or daily delivery or whatever.  I suppose (although I never checked) that the delivery was only for non-perishables.  There must have been some other arrangement for things like meat, eggs, produce, etc.  The timing was odd, but maybe the truck had an early route, and that was the first store?  Hard to say.  For reasons that will become obvious, I never asked.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day, I noticed the stack of supply pallets had a bunch of #10 cans on them.  When I got closer, I saw the label identifying them as the gooey caramel sauce that McDonald&amp;#39;s used for their sundays.  I liked that shit.  It was awesome.  It being just after 4:00AM, my brain wasn&amp;#39;t working all that well, so I decided I would take one of them with me to school and me and my teammates would eat it with a spoon.  Best day ever!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then I thought: What if we eat &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the syrup?  That would leave none for me when I had ice cream at home.  Who was I to deny my family &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; share of tasty caramel sundays?  Solution:  Zip on home and get something more cargo capable than a tricked-out Schwinn with a banana seat and chopper handlebars.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In all of five minutes, our family&amp;#39;s Dodge Dart was loaded down with ten #10 cans of caramel syrup.  I drove it home, made as little noise as I could unloading and hiding the cans, and then booked it back to school on my bike.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stealing what was probably a couple of months&amp;#39; worth of sunday topping for a single McDonald&amp;#39;s is probably enough to qualify as a FU, but I&amp;#39;ve found that this subreddit expects consequences, even if they aren&amp;#39;t all that consequential.  There were several.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing I realized after successfully pulling off the one and only &amp;quot;heist&amp;quot; of my abbreviated criminal career was that you really couldn&amp;#39;t open one of those #10 cans without somewhere to put all the stuff inside of it.  I could maybe consume a couple of spoonfulls of caramel syrup at a time.  Any more than that, and it started tasting awful.  Deliciously awful, but still awful.  So that left the problem of what to do with the rest of the syrup.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So on the first day I decided to enjoy the fruits of my juvenile delinquency, I ended up attempting to pour the majority of a #10 can of McDonald&amp;#39;s caramel syrup down my family&amp;#39;s bathroom sink.  Fun fact: caramel syrup does not go gently into that good night. It clogged up the sink almost immediately, leaving me in the ONE bathroom in our tiny single-family abode with a mostly full #10 ten can of thick vanilla-flavored goodness, a sink filled about 1/3 of the way up with the rest of it, and a growing line of siblings pounding on the door clamoring to get in so they can pee.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Running hot water into the sink only helped a tiny bit.  It diluted the syrup IN the sink but did nothing to unclog what must have been the world&amp;#39;s largest Heath Bar lodged in the P-trap under the vanity.  Even the plunger had no effect.  In desperation, I used my cupped hands to transfer as much syrup and brownish sweet water from sink to toilet, flushing as often as the tank would fill up.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sink mostly emptied, I then attempted to clean up.  But we kept cleaning supplies in the linen closet OUTSIDE of the bathroom, so all I had on hand were towels and toilet paper.  I didn&amp;#39;t dare try to use the towels- my mom would have killed me!  So I tried using the toilet paper.  Which is when I learned that caramel syrup sticks to counters, toilet seats, walls, floors, etc. much harder than it sticks to toilet paper.  All I really managed to do was add a layer of Charmin to the mess on every surface between sink and toilet.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, faced with a &amp;quot;Heeeeere&amp;#39;s Johnny!&amp;quot; moment from a pair of angry siblings, I opened the door.  My older brother took one look at the place and said &amp;quot;holy fuck! What were you doing in here?  Did you shit in the sink?&amp;quot;  Which, to be fair, was a reasonable first impression for someone seeing brown smears all over sink, counter, and toilet seat.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which led to my &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; Fuck Up of the day:  I just went with it.  Somehow, it made more sense at the time to confess to blowing out the sink&amp;#39;s pipes with an enormous load of feces than to admit that I had stolen a giant can of McDonald&amp;#39;s caramel syrup.  Value judgements were not my forte at the time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t remember what lame excuse I made.  &amp;quot;Yeah, the toilet was clogged, so I didn&amp;#39;t have any choice,&amp;quot; I probably said.  And then I grabbed some Formula 409 out of the linen closet and started spraying it everywhere, despite my brothers&amp;#39; increasingly agitated peepee dances.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never the brightest bulbs in the shed, they both accepted my lame explanation, satisfied perhaps with an admission of guilt and the potential for giving me a hard time about shitting in the sink.  Which they did for many decades, often, and with great enthusiasm.  And so I became that one weird cousin who shits in the sink.  &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t let &lt;a href=\"/u/Leftunder\"&gt;/u/Leftunder&lt;/a&gt; use your bathroom!  He&amp;#39;ll shit in your sink!&amp;quot; they&amp;#39;d say whenever we visited the aunts &amp;amp; uncles.  Of course, I&amp;#39;d be helpless to defend myself.  &amp;quot;It was really just a lot of caramel syrup&amp;quot; would have demanded too much awkward explanation.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there was a third, less impactful consequence:  When I bragged about my haul to my closest fellow teenage reprobates, one of them made the astute observation that those #10 cans were probably super expensive.  I forget the math, but we concluded that I had committed the equivalent of grand theft auto in McDonald&amp;#39;s caramel syrup.  So instead of getting to enjoy the fruits of my labor, we ended up opening just one more can, each spooning out enough to make us physically ill, and then dumping out the rest in the woods.  Somewhere there is a dynasty of ants worshiping the Divine Provider that poured the manna from heaven that fed their colony for untold generations.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and add one more:  After the wake-up call of realizing I had committed a felony, I decided that cutting through the McDonald&amp;#39;s parking lot wasn&amp;#39;t a good idea, nor was being noticed as the one guy riding a bike at 4:30AM every day.  The ace detective they assigned to solve the Great Syrup Caper of 1978 would surely put 2&amp;amp;2 together, and all it would take is one blood sugar reading to prove my guilt.  So I quit the swim team.  Which wasn&amp;#39;t all that big of a deal since I was a shitty swimmer and actually hated getting up that early anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "I never planned to use this account again, but here I am anyway. It's been a couple of years since my last post, so let me provide a recap. About 2 years ago I had my first threesome with my friend and his gf. Mid sex, specifically oral sex, my dentures slipped out while I was going down on my friend's gf. I've been wearing dentures for most of my life due to an accident that left me with missing teeth. I downplayed the awkward atmosphere in the bedroom with a joke. I said I heard that gummy BJs are the best BJs. My friend made it very clear that he had no interest in getting a regular BJ from me, much less a gummy BJ. The three of us laughed about it and continued with the threesome. However, my friend's gf asked if I was willing to go down on her without my dentures so that she could feel what toothless cunnilingus was like. \n\nI was like why not, so I embraced my most unattractive form and ate her out with no dentures. I never got the impression that she was not enjoying it, until my friend informed me the following day that I fucked up when I removed my dentures during oral sex because it was off-putting for him and his gf, even though the two of them acted like it wasn't. I said I was sorry, and it seemed like my friend accepted my apology, but our friendship was never the same again. In fact, as of now, I would say there's nothing left of our friendship. So, considering the fact that I basically lost a friend because of a threesome, I was like fuck threesomes. Never again. Until a month ago. My gf and I were having a random discussion about past relationships and some of the kinky things we've done with previous partners, and that was when my gf found out about the threesome I had. And she got excited. Like, really excited.\n\nShe was keen to invite another person into our bedroom. Girl or guy. Whatever worked for both of us. She said she always wanted to have a threesome but she's never been with someone she trusted enough to actually do it with. Until me. Her enthusiasm was infectious. Before I knew it, I was all in. The two of us decided to go with a girl as our third person. The girl was someone my gf and I crossed paths with at a club in Cape Town while we were on holiday in South Africa. Towards the end of our holiday, the threesome happened. It was hot at first. No hiccups. Not until the moment came when I was laying naked on my back while my gf was sitting on my face and the Capetonian girl was going down on me. I automatically removed my dentures while my gf was on top of my face. I always eat her out with no dentures. She likes it that way. I fucked up twice at that point without even knowing it.\n\nFirst, I failed to warn the other girl, who was unaware that I had dentures, that I was gonna remove my fake teeth during oral sex. Second, I failed to remember that I was totally toothless from that moment onwards. The combination of both of these fuck ups created an unexpected jump scare when we eventually switched positions and the other girl suddenly saw me without my teeth. She screamed her lungs out and literally leaped off the bed. I didn't understand what was happening until my gf, who seemed to be on the verge of laughing hysterically, nudged me with her elbow and said babe put your teeth back in your mouth. I was like shit, my bad, and grabbed my dentures. The other girl regained her composure and repeatedly said sorry for the way she reacted. I said it was all my fault and promised to keep my teeth where it belonged for the rest of the threesome, assuming that everyone was still keen to continue.\n\nWe continued. I thought it was a fun night. But just like my last threesome a couple of years ago, the following day changed everything. I overheard the other girl talking on the phone with someone. She was standing on the balcony with her back towards the glass door. I was in the living room, looking for my phone charger, trying to mind my own business. My gf was still sleeping. It was really early. I missed the beginning of the conversation, but I did catch the other girl telling the person on the phone that she struggled to fall asleep because apparently our bed was not big enough for 3 people, which I thought was kind of funny. I stopped smiling when she said I looked like the bad guy in Skyfall without my dentures. I used what little battery life I had left on my phone to Google \"bad guy in Skyfall\" and the results on Google images totally obliterated my self confidence. When I looked up from my phone, the other girl was facing the glass door, which scared the shit of me, but it became clear that she couldn't see inside. \n\nI eavesdropped for another 2 minutes before I returned to the bedroom with a potent dose of post threesome trauma. The last 2 minutes of unfiltered gossip I exposed my ears to was basically the other girl telling whoever she talking to that she would've had more fun if she was alone with my gf because she was unable to unsee my gummy grin for the rest of her life and that pretty much killed the possibility of an orgasm during our threesome. Like I said, I tapped out after 2 minutes. My confidence could take no more. I shared none of this with my gf or the other girl. Random people on the internet can know that I know, but no one who knows me must know. So there it is. My second threesome in 2 years. Why fail once when failing twice feels so much worse. \n\nTL:DR Two threesomes in 2 years. Lost a friend during the first threesome due to my dentures. Gained insecurities during my second threesome due to my dentures. Translation of the latter: my gf and I had a threesome with another girl, who unexpectedly saw me without my dentures during sex and then very expectedly got a huge fright. The following morning I overheard the other girl talking to someone on the phone and telling that person that my toothless look totally killed her orgasm, leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth, and of course, fake teeth.\n",

And she got excited. Like, really excited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was keen to invite another person into our bedroom. Girl or guy. Whatever worked for both of us. She said she always wanted to have a threesome but she&amp;#39;s never been with someone she trusted enough to actually do it with. Until me. Her enthusiasm was infectious. Before I knew it, I was all in. The two of us decided to go with a girl as our third person. The girl was someone my gf and I crossed paths with at a club in Cape Town while we were on holiday in South Africa. Towards the end of our holiday, the threesome happened. It was hot at first. No hiccups. Not until the moment came when I was laying naked on my back while my gf was sitting on my face and the Capetonian girl was going down on me. I automatically removed my dentures while my gf was on top of my face. I always eat her out with no dentures. She likes it that way. I fucked up twice at that point without even knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, I failed to warn the other girl, who was unaware that I had dentures, that I was gonna remove my fake teeth during oral sex. Second, I failed to remember that I was totally toothless from that moment onwards. The combination of both of these fuck ups created an unexpected jump scare when we eventually switched positions and the other girl suddenly saw me without my teeth. She screamed her lungs out and literally leaped off the bed. I didn&amp;#39;t understand what was happening until my gf, who seemed to be on the verge of laughing hysterically, nudged me with her elbow and said babe put your teeth back in your mouth. I was like shit, my bad, and grabbed my dentures. The other girl regained her composure and repeatedly said sorry for the way she reacted. I said it was all my fault and promised to keep my teeth where it belonged for the rest of the threesome, assuming that everyone was still keen to continue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We continued. I thought it was a fun night. But just like my last threesome a couple of years ago, the following day changed everything. I overheard the other girl talking on the phone with someone. She was standing on the balcony with her back towards the glass door. I was in the living room, looking for my phone charger, trying to mind my own business. My gf was still sleeping. It was really early. I missed the beginning of the conversation, but I did catch the other girl telling the person on the phone that she struggled to fall asleep because apparently our bed was not big enough for 3 people, which I thought was kind of funny. I stopped smiling when she said I looked like the bad guy in Skyfall without my dentures. I used what little battery life I had left on my phone to Google &amp;quot;bad guy in Skyfall&amp;quot; and the results on Google images totally obliterated my self confidence. When I looked up from my phone, the other girl was facing the glass door, which scared the shit of me, but it became clear that she couldn&amp;#39;t see inside. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I eavesdropped for another 2 minutes before I returned to the bedroom with a potent dose of post threesome trauma. The last 2 minutes of unfiltered gossip I exposed my ears to was basically the other girl telling whoever she talking to that she would&amp;#39;ve had more fun if she was alone with my gf because she was unable to unsee my gummy grin for the rest of her life and that pretty much killed the possibility of an orgasm during our threesome. Like I said, I tapped out after 2 minutes. My confidence could take no more. I shared none of this with my gf or the other girl. Random people on the internet can know that I know, but no one who knows me must know. So there it is. My second threesome in 2 years. Why fail once when failing twice feels so much worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR Two threesomes in 2 years. Lost a friend during the first threesome due to my dentures. Gained insecurities during my second threesome due to my dentures. Translation of the latter: my gf and I had a threesome with another girl, who unexpectedly saw me without my dentures during sex and then very expectedly got a huge fright. The following morning I overheard the other girl talking to someone on the phone and telling that person that my toothless look totally killed her orgasm, leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth, and of course, fake teeth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It's weird but I couldn't make this shit up to save my life. \n\nWhen I was about 14, I awoke to the sounds of our front door being knocked at the ungodly hour of about 1am &amp; then voices. My mum came upstairs and said our neighbour was in a bit of a state about his dog and she couldn't understand much of what he'd said &amp; got me up to go help her (dad was working a night shift). We went 3 doors up to the neighbour's house, they were Polish migrants from the war (he'd captained a boat at Dunkirk) and spoke just a smattering of English, most of it we (us kids) imagined as shouting Polish obscentites at his dog to come back from the field behind our houses. It wasn't a friendly dog, it would bark at us and it was we might call in the UK (back then anyway) a bit of a \"fat woofer\", none of that 'chunky' euphemism back then. \nOn reaching their house we saw the dog in the front garden, whilst the wife was sobbing in the doorway with the husband holding her. Mum and I went over to the dog and it had passed away (insert Monty Python dead parrot sketch excerpt). But........my Mum has British middle class manners, manners with a heavy dose of British reserve and a cheeky bit of insanity thrown in. I whispered to her \"Mum, the dog's dead\", she hissed back \"ssssh pick him up, move his legs and we'll see if he wakes up, we have to do something to help them \"....so we picked up the pooch and in the style of a pair of demonic renanimators, \"walked\" him by his legs by hand across the garden. After about 6ft of this ungodly Punch and Judy show, I told my mum I was knackered, she whispered to me to put him down and curl him up. She then went over to the couple and told them he was sleeping and to take him to the vets tomorrow, she then grabbed me and we hoofed it away el pronto. \n\nBut it only occurred to me some 40 odd years later, there might have been what we now call a \"comms issue\", with them being Polish with a limited English vocabulary and they quite possibly knew the dog was dead all that time and my mum had made me carry out this therapy-inducing act rather than ask them what they wanted us to do. Me? I just went back to bed and thought nothing of it, crazy shit like this happened all the time in 70's/80's. \n\nTLDR mum thought picking up a neighbours dead dog and moving him might ressurect him",

    "selftext": "To start this off I'm a teenage girl and I wouldn't say I'm the worst kid in the world but I'm certainly not a good one. I sometimes do really stupid things for example I'm typing this on a secret burner phone, I sneak out, I drink, I skip class, I smoke, I don't get good grades, In generall I just have a lot of secrets. Most of this is just escapism because life's a shit show but that doesn't make it good or right. \n\nToday I stayed up all night which is usual for me but about 1-2 hours ago I felt super tired and passed out on the couch and was immediately grounded when I woke up. \nTurns out my mom went in my room to grab some towels and found a mostly empty bottle of alcohol I had in my closet. She was so angry that she didn't yell she was just cold and had a tone that I dont know how to describe. She is also very adamantly against alcohol which doesn't help the situation.\n\nShe has never found out about anything like this and I don't know what to do. She's a pretty good mom for the most part and I know life's stressful for her. I mean she's a single mom of two teenagers working full time trying to navigate around her ex husband (my shit dad) trying to still control us it's stupidity stressful for her. I don't need to burden her with any more of my stupid problems than I already do. \n\nShe mentioned something about inspecting my room. I've been grounded from all my devices. I'm not allowed to go anywhere (I don't have a single friend so that's not a big deal) She's really gonna be cracking down on me and I still dont have an idea of the full extent of the punishment as she is still thinking.\n\nI'm aware that these are the consequences of my actions. I'm not trying to fight that, but Is there anything at all I can do or say to help with this situation. I just don't want her to hate me. I'm so lost and I'm freaking out.

I sometimes do really stupid things for example I&amp;#39;m typing this on a secret burner phone, I sneak out, I drink, I skip class, I smoke, I don&amp;#39;t get good grades, In generall I just have a lot of secrets. Most of this is just escapism because life&amp;#39;s a shit show but that doesn&amp;#39;t make it good or right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I stayed up all night which is usual for me but about 1-2 hours ago I felt super tired and passed out on the couch and was immediately grounded when I woke up. \nTurns out my mom went in my room to grab some towels and found a mostly empty bottle of alcohol I had in my closet. She was so angry that she didn&amp;#39;t yell she was just cold and had a tone that I dont know how to describe. She is also very adamantly against alcohol which doesn&amp;#39;t help the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She has never found out about anything like this and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. She&amp;#39;s a pretty good mom for the most part and I know life&amp;#39;s stressful for her. I mean she&amp;#39;s a single mom of two teenagers working full time trying to navigate around her ex husband (my shit dad) trying to still control us it&amp;#39;s stupidity stressful for her. I don&amp;#39;t need to burden her with any more of my stupid problems than I already do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She mentioned something about inspecting my room. I&amp;#39;ve been grounded from all my devices. I&amp;#39;m not allowed to go anywhere (I don&amp;#39;t have a single friend so that&amp;#39;s not a big deal) She&amp;#39;s really gonna be cracking down on me and I still dont have an idea of the full extent of the punishment as she is still thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m aware that these are the consequences of my actions. I&amp;#39;m not trying to fight that, but Is there anything at all I can do or say to help with this situation. I just don&amp;#39;t want her to hate me. I&amp;#39;m so lost and I&amp;#39;m freaking out. I genuinely don&amp;#39;t have any idea what to do now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this is quite lengthy sorry for that I just have a lot of words to say. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I&amp;#39;m a teenage girl and my mom found a bottle of alcohol in my room.

    "selftext": "So\u2026. Uhh\u2026. As the title says; last year I (19f) used blue hairspray for a Coraline Halloween costume, and it was a mess. It got everywhere. My hair, clothes, bed, walls, stuffed animals, and on unspeakable crevices of my room and body.\n\nThis year, I went as Chappell Roan, and I used red hairspray to achieve the look. It was much easier to handle than last year\u2019s (as I had my bestie to help me spray my hair), but it was still a lot to deal with.

I may have drunk dialed my husband telling him I don't know how to order uber or where I am and he was already angry at me for this.\n\n\nNow today is where is gets worse. We don't use WhatsApp much but we use it for school to organise things with the parents for the kids. A mum was trying to contact me but contacted my husband instead as she wondered if someone else has my number now because it's random people in the photo. \n\nSo the photo was of a guy taking a selfie while standing next to a girl. I don't know either of them. My husband says he doesn't trust me, got super mad and pissed at me. Started yelling. Like I've never seen him this angry before! His reaction really shocked me. \n\nI explained I don't know them and obviously I didn't change the photo. Yes it's from octoberfest and looks to be around where I was sitting. My guess is I left my phone on the table (which I did often as we would stand up to dance many people did the same) and some guy decided to play a joke on me by uploading a photo of himself and his friend or his gf. \n\nNow my husband doesn't believe it and thinks I unlocked it for him because how would someone just have access to my phone.. Now I know it's too trusting of me but I was drunk and often left my phone open and on camera mode as I was often taking video and photos there. \n\nSo being extremely stupid and not even realising this happened weeks ago.. Now my husband super mad at me. I've upset him. Look like at idiot on my WhatsApp parenting group too. Now I feel like my entire marriage is starting to fall apart. \n\nTLDR my marriage is rocky because I didn't watch my phone at octoberfest and left at the table letting some guy take a selfie and upload it as my display pic ",

We haven't eaten a full meal all day so we decided to go to a Chinese restaurant that we have been to before and really enjoy. One of the items we order was a pan fried soup dumpling (Sheng Jian) because we generally like the traditional soup dumpling (Xiao Long Bao), but this one was in a bun and pan fried. My mom described it as the filling of the Xiao Long Bao, just in a bun instead. Now for those that don't know, Xiao Long Bao is normal piping hot, and the right way to eat it is to put in on a spoon, poke a hole to let the soup out, then eat it after it cools a bit.\n\nA couple minutes go by and out food is delivered, this is when the FU occurrs. I forgot that the Sheng Jian had soup in it, I assumed that it was just the meat inside and maybe the soup was absorbed by the bun. Boy was I wrong. I bit into the bun, it squirt its hot juice straight up into my nose and burned my nostril and upper lip. So now, here I am, the inside of my nostril is peeling and raw, new skin is starting to heal but is making my skin tight and it hurts to move and breathe. I should have known, and I have paid the price.\n\nTL;DR I bit into a hot soup dumpling, and burned my nostril and upper lip.",

We haven&amp;#39;t eaten a full meal all day so we decided to go to a Chinese restaurant that we have been to before and really enjoy. One of the items we order was a pan fried soup dumpling (Sheng Jian) because we generally like the traditional soup dumpling (Xiao Long Bao), but this one was in a bun and pan fried. My mom described it as the filling of the Xiao Long Bao, just in a bun instead. Now for those that don&amp;#39;t know, Xiao Long Bao is normal piping hot, and the right way to eat it is to put in on a spoon, poke a hole to let the soup out, then eat it after it cools a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple minutes go by and out food is delivered, this is when the FU occurrs. I forgot that the Sheng Jian had soup in it, I assumed that it was just the meat inside and maybe the soup was absorbed by the bun. Boy was I wrong. I bit into the bun, it squirt its hot juice straight up into my nose and burned my nostril and upper lip. So now, here I am, the inside of my nostril is peeling and raw, new skin is starting to heal but is making my skin tight and it hurts to move and breathe. I should have known, and I have paid the price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I bit into a hot soup dumpling, and burned my nostril and upper lip.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I finished peeing, waited to make sure the other user was in a stall, flushed and exited (yes, skipped hand washing which I never skip), hid my face, and headed out as fast as I could without running.  I found my wife who had just started looking at stuff and told her \u201cwe have to leave, NOW.\u201d  Somehow, I made it out of there without being recognized or being caught.  Lesson learned: make darn sure I see the entirety of the sign above the door before concluding is says \u201cmen\u201d, because the \u201cWo\u201d part might be blocked from view.\n\nTLDR: I missed the \u201cWo\u201d part of the \u201cWomen\u201d sign, and read only \u201cmen\u201d, and ended up using the women\u2019s room by accident.",

But I can\u2019t simply stop peeing and leave, cuz I\u2019m bursting.  So I aimed above the water line to avoid making the telltale \u201cguy peeing\u201d sound, and hoped for the best.  Then I heard someone else enter the restroom\u2026Oh crap.  I finished peeing, waited to make sure the other user was in a stall, flushed and exited (yes, skipped hand washing which I never skip), hid my face, and headed out as fast as I could without running.  I found my wife who had just started looking at stuff and told her \u201cwe have to leave, NOW.\u201d  Somehow, I made it out of there without being recognized or being caught.  Lesson learned: make darn sure I see the entirety of the sign above the door before concluding is says \u201cmen\u201d, because the \u201cWo\u201d part might be blocked from view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I missed the \u201cWo\u201d part of the \u201cWomen\u201d sign, and read only \u201cmen\u201d, and ended up using the women\u2019s room by accident.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I've moved out of state to stay with him. I've pushed for him to go to therapy and been understanding about so much. \nAbout a week or so ago, my husband-to-be went to the dentist and they found a spot under his tongue that could be cancerous.\nToday, he had a consultation with a surgeon to evaluate the spot and get feedback. He agreed that it's probably cancerous and scheduled his biopsy for a few weeks from now. The results will also take two weeks to get back. In that time, it could spread and get worse. \nPrior to all this, I've been dealing with severe depression and chronic fatigue, among a plethora of other conditions. Sleeping is all I seem capable of and I can't get off the couch. My therapist advised me to complete at least one task a day, which I've been struggling to do. \nSo, when I came to bed last night at about 9:30, I still woke up at 2:30 and stayed that way until 7 this morning, when we were supposed to leave to go to the appointment. \nI was cranky and groggy and asked him if he wanted me to go. Of course he did, but he wouldn't say so. He left and had to deal with everything alone and then go to work. He just got home and won't even let me touch him and won't speak to me and I don't blame him. I feel awful about it all. I can't imagine how betrayed he must feel. He thinks I don't love him or care about him. \nI don't know what to do. How do I fix this? Can I fix this? \nTL;DR: didn't go with fiancee to important appointment and he faced consequent cancer diagnosis alone. ",

PTSD included. We&amp;#39;ve survived so much. And I love him more than anything. I&amp;#39;ve moved out of state to stay with him. I&amp;#39;ve pushed for him to go to therapy and been understanding about so much. \nAbout a week or so ago, my husband-to-be went to the dentist and they found a spot under his tongue that could be cancerous.\nToday, he had a consultation with a surgeon to evaluate the spot and get feedback. He agreed that it&amp;#39;s probably cancerous and scheduled his biopsy for a few weeks from now. The results will also take two weeks to get back. In that time, it could spread and get worse. \nPrior to all this, I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with severe depression and chronic fatigue, among a plethora of other conditions. Sleeping is all I seem capable of and I can&amp;#39;t get off the couch. My therapist advised me to complete at least one task a day, which I&amp;#39;ve been struggling to do. \nSo, when I came to bed last night at about 9:30, I still woke up at 2:30 and stayed that way until 7 this morning, when we were supposed to leave to go to the appointment. \nI was cranky and groggy and asked him if he wanted me to go. Of course he did, but he wouldn&amp;#39;t say so. He left and had to deal with everything alone and then go to work. He just got home and won&amp;#39;t even let me touch him and won&amp;#39;t speak to me and I don&amp;#39;t blame him. I feel awful about it all. I can&amp;#39;t imagine how betrayed he must feel. He thinks I don&amp;#39;t love him or care about him. \nI don&amp;#39;t know what to do. How do I fix this? Can I fix this? \nTL;DR: didn&amp;#39;t go with fiancee to important appointment and he faced consequent cancer diagnosis alone. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I exit through the back door as instructed by my parents and then lock the door behind me. Our backdoor leads into like this screened off porch btw.

I then cancel the Uber as he's been waiting there for like 3 minutes. I call in on my work to say I can't come in today (on my second day). I didn't have enough money for another Uber because I was down to my last few dollars and had to pay the cancellation fee for the Uber I already ordered. \n\nSo getting all that out of the way and cursing at myself I just sit patiently waiting for my brother to get home.

    "selftext": "Update: A week and a half of growth and I'm back to my sexy stubble of years ago - although in a somewhat greyer version. Marriage is saved! However... During 6 years of trying to convince me to trim my beard down, she somehow seems to have forgotten that sexy stubble is somewhat prickly, and she is now conflicted whether she prefers her sexy, but prickly husband or the less prickly handsome full bearded one. \ud83d\ude02\n\n\n\nI (41M) have had a beard of some kind pretty much all my adult life. Last time I was clean shaven was exactly 20 years ago in 2004.\n\nWhen I met my wife 12 years ago I had a short beard - \"sexy stubble\" about 5 mm (that's 0.2\" to our metrically challenged friends). The past 6 years or so I've sported a full grown beard.\n\nMy wife has told me loads of times, to trim my beard to the shorter version I used to have. She's never hidden the fact that she preferred it that way - especially when it got really long after I let it grow for a year or so.\n\nLately my 7 year old son has been saying he'd like to see me without the beard and we've had banter about it. Early this week my wife had long days at a conference and my son and I have been home due to holidays. On Monday I decided \"fuck it\" and took my beard off. I trimmed it down, and did a full clean shave.\n\nMy wife came home in the evening and hated it. She told me it was a huge turn off, told me I looked like my younger brother and that it felt weird. Now she won't kiss me or have sex with me before my beard grows back.\n\nTL:DR: Shaved my beard for the first time in 20 years, now wife won't kiss me or have sex until it is grows back.\n\n\nEdit: I've slightly exaggerated for the sake of the story. We've HAVE kissed, but she feels really weird about it, and the resemblance to my brother, who we don't have the best relationship with, throws her off.\n\nThere's been a fair bit of joking and teasing about it, and I really prefer myself with a beard as well.\n\nShe's also apologised for been too \"harsh\" in her reaction, but she was caught off guard.\n\nWe're happily married and very much love each other. Please refrain from name calling. ",

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: A week and a half of growth and I&amp;#39;m back to my sexy stubble of years ago - although in a somewhat greyer version. Marriage is saved! However... During 6 years of trying to convince me to trim my beard down, she somehow seems to have forgotten that sexy stubble is somewhat prickly, and she is now conflicted whether she prefers her sexy, but prickly husband or the less prickly handsome full bearded one. \ud83d\ude02&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I (41M) have had a beard of some kind pretty much all my adult life. Last time I was clean shaven was exactly 20 years ago in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I met my wife 12 years ago I had a short beard - &amp;quot;sexy stubble&amp;quot; about 5 mm (that&amp;#39;s 0.2&amp;quot; to our metrically challenged friends). The past 6 years or so I&amp;#39;ve sported a full grown beard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife has told me loads of times, to trim my beard to the shorter version I used to have. She&amp;#39;s never hidden the fact that she preferred it that way - especially when it got really long after I let it grow for a year or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lately my 7 year old son has been saying he&amp;#39;d like to see me without the beard and we&amp;#39;ve had banter about it. Early this week my wife had long days at a conference and my son and I have been home due to holidays. On Monday I decided &amp;quot;fuck it&amp;quot; and took my beard off. I trimmed it down, and did a full clean shave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife came home in the evening and hated it. She told me it was a huge turn off, told me I looked like my younger brother and that it felt weird. Now she won&amp;#39;t kiss me or have sex with me before my beard grows back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR: Shaved my beard for the first time in 20 years, now wife won&amp;#39;t kiss me or have sex until it is grows back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;ve slightly exaggerated for the sake of the story. We&amp;#39;ve HAVE kissed, but she feels really weird about it, and the resemblance to my brother, who we don&amp;#39;t have the best relationship with, throws her off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s been a fair bit of joking and teasing about it, and I really prefer myself with a beard as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s also apologised for been too &amp;quot;harsh&amp;quot; in her reaction, but she was caught off guard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re happily married and very much love each other. Please refrain from name calling. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We have a small number of Apple trees in our yard.\n\nWe got a new dog this week, he is a 9 month old German Shephard rescue. He is wonderful, still working on name recall etc.\n\nLast night I let the dog out into our fenced yard for a toilet break before bed. I saw them too late, a decent sized Mumma black bear and a smaller cub in the back corner. He was off after them before I could react. Due to the size/shape of the Yard the Mumma bear hurried her cub up the closest tree and followed it after. I ran inside to grab the dogs lead and a can of bear spray we keep around (we get bears a lot).\n\nA good 20 mins of him barking/lunging at them and the bears hissing/fake charging back.\n\nI decided it was not going to resolve itself, the bears were not going anywhere (fenced in yard, unsure how they got in - perhaps over the back smaller fence) and I was not able to call the Dog to heel or get his lead onto him.\n\nI decided to open the side gates around our house to give the bears 2 ways out, as I was securing the gate through our carport to the front (and hopefully a way out for the bears), I had the bear spray in my hand and accidentally leaned against the trigger (it's a top press, and I had the safety off when the bear started charging and I thought he might try and run up onto our back porch).\n\nIt was only a quick spray, but it was in an enclosed space (car port) and I was done. Blind and burning I stumbled out into the front and lay on the lawn. The dog noticed I was gone and to his credit came to check on me, fortunately I heard him and still had his lead in my hand, so was able to connect it to his collar and I fumbled us in the side door (from carport) and locked it behind us. Bear problem solved, I had bigger issues though.\n\nEnded up filling sink with water and dunking my head in there for a few minutes, which helped a little, then I was in the shower for a good 20mins flushing my face under the water. Came good about 35mins post spray, no ongoing effects.\n\nThis morning, I go out to clean up the mess, I close the gates, check on the trees, the dog runs around sniffing everything and I go back inside. There is the real TIFU I guess, I had not considered residual bear spray on the door handle and frame for the gate, when I came back inside I wiped the inside of my eye and it hit me again. F, back in the shower for another 15 minutes, luckily just the one eye. Several hours later I feel like I have a mild sunburn.\n\nI need to go back to the carport and hose everything down, ill wear gloves and PPE this time.\n\nTLDR: I was clumsy and bear sprayed myself in the face, forgot about residual spray and post cleanup today got it back in my eyes again.\n\nEdit: \\*spelling",

I had caught a ride home from the gym and had forgotten about my bike (locked) at the bike rack outside my gym. The city I live in is notorious for bike thef.

There was no way I was getting back inside an uber. I did somehow manage to make it to my office before I threw up in the bathroom. I can't remember much of it but I think I threw up another 6-7 times and napped as much as I could on the bathroom floor inbetween. As soon as I'm done I would feel sick again.

    "selftext": "The title does imply that this was today but it is more appropriate to stand for \"Thursday I f*Ed up\" because it took me some time to realize just how badly I f*Ed up.\nSo, it was a painfully hot summer and fall has been nowhere to be found, therefore the hedges in the front yard were monstrous from neglect. I decided that it was cool enough in the mornings to go out and tackle those bad boys and be in before it started getting to warm. I put on zip up jacket over my t shirt, to protect from bug bites and such and went to work. Behind the hedges, and growing up around the windows were these annoying invasive unsightly vines. So I started pulling them off the house and using the electric trimmer to chop them up. Everything seemed to fine. I went inside and immediately showered and washed my clothes.\nThe next morning my hand was terribly itchy, and I assumed I had gotten a bug bite or two. But later that morning my eye was also incredibly itchy. It seemed to get worse and worse throughout the day. Saturday morning I noticed some hives on my forearms. I have autoimmune issues, so a bug bite can cause me to break out in hives sometimes. However, my eye was starting to get pretty swollen and I was super itchy. The rash kept spreading and getting worse and by Monday morning I looked like Quasimodo, I could barely open my eye and my whole face was swollen and red. I was so freaking confused and worried. It wasn't until today that all the hives on my hands and arms were covered in the world's grossest bubble wrap (blisters everywhere) that I had a flashback to that time I got poison ivy as a teenager. I ran outside and used Google Lens on the vines that still remained and it came up... \nPoison Ivy.\nWhat the actual heck? I literally did not know that poison ivy can grow up your house in vines (although I should have, duh, IVY). So my dumb ass was pulling and chopping up poison ivy vines without gloves. And somehow it not only penetrated my jacket but it managed to get through my bra and t shirt as well. This is a painful but well received lesson to learn\n\nPics might me NSFW but here are some of the worst spots, although I do have it near my groin too:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/rWvmlc6\n\nTL;DR\nToday I fucked up by ignorantly pulling down poison ivy vines with my bare hands and I am now covered in regret\nand blisters",

I decided that it was cool enough in the mornings to go out and tackle those bad boys and be in before it started getting to warm. I put on zip up jacket over my t shirt, to protect from bug bites and such and went to work. Behind the hedges, and growing up around the windows were these annoying invasive unsightly vines. So I started pulling them off the house and using the electric trimmer to chop them up. Everything seemed to fine. I went inside and immediately showered and washed my clothes.\nThe next morning my hand was terribly itchy, and I assumed I had gotten a bug bite or two. But later that morning my eye was also incredibly itchy. It seemed to get worse and worse throughout the day. Saturday morning I noticed some hives on my forearms. I have autoimmune issues, so a bug bite can cause me to break out in hives sometimes. However, my eye was starting to get pretty swollen and I was super itchy. The rash kept spreading and getting worse and by Monday morning I looked like Quasimodo, I could barely open my eye and my whole face was swollen and red. I was so freaking confused and worried. It wasn&amp;#39;t until today that all the hives on my hands and arms were covered in the world&amp;#39;s grossest bubble wrap (blisters everywhere) that I had a flashback to that time I got poison ivy as a teenager. I ran outside and used Google Lens on the vines that still remained and it came up... \nPoison Ivy.\nWhat the actual heck? I literally did not know that poison ivy can grow up your house in vines (although I should have, duh, IVY). So my dumb ass was pulling and chopping up poison ivy vines without gloves. And somehow it not only penetrated my jacket but it managed to get through my bra and t shirt as well. This is a painful but well received lesson to learn&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pics might me NSFW but here are some of the worst spots, although I do have it near my groin too:\n&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/rWvmlc6\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/rWvmlc6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR\nToday I fucked up by ignorantly pulling down poison ivy vines with my bare hands and I am now covered in regret\nand blisters&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "Oblig:  This happened a long time ago, back when McDonalds used to fry their cherry pies into crispy crusted morsels of heaven instead of microwaving them into limp blobs of disappointment.  So technically It's more of \"That One Time I Fucked Up.\"  \n  \nThe proper forms have been satisfied.  Let's move on.  \n  \nMy first day as a McDonalds employee, I was given the easy assignment of working the less busy fry station.  Back then, fish sandwich patties were dropped in oil and fried until golden crisp.  So were the cherry pies, but they were fried in a separate vat for obvious reasons.  Some genius decided to put these two fry vats next to each other.  Another genius came along and decided to not put labels on either of them.  To be fair, I believe the frozen patties and pies were stored in separate freezers next to their respective vats (flanking the conjoined vats, as it were).  \n  \nBeing new, I had no idea which was which.  So when the manager yelled \"drop six pies!\" across the counter top, I did exactly that:  I put six frozen cherry pies into the little rack that held them and dropped the rack and pies into the fry vat.  The Filet O'Fish fry vat to be precise.  \n  \nA few minutes later, a half dozen beautiful bubbly crusted cherry pies emerged, golden brown and seemingly delicious.  They sold immediately, so I was told to do it again.  Which I did.  Nice job, /u/tillerman35!  You're our best new employee ever!  (That's what I thought I would hear in a few minutes)  \n  \nIt didn't take long for customers to storm the counter asking to speak to the manager.  Apparently, frying cherry pies in oil that had previously held a day's worth of frozen fish patties imparts a certain piquant flavor to the pies.  Cod-flavored cherry pies might be a thing in some countries.  I don't know.  I've never checked.  But it wasn't something midwestern American palates were accustomed to.  Perhaps I was a bit too avant garde.  \n  \nSo that's how I learned how to drain and refill a fry vat on my first day working at McDonalds.  All the customers who complained got their money back and a fresh hot cherry pie.  Those who left with take-out pies probably suffered, for which I've felt some residual guilt over the years.  If you were at a McDonalds and got a fishy tasting cherry pie, it was probably my fault and I apologize.  \n  \ntl;dr:  Put the frozen cherry pies into the fish fryer.  Made fishy pies.  People complained.  My bad.  \n  \nBonus FU:  One time, after I had graduated to burger flipper, I wrapped wet grill towel in cheeseburger paper and put it under the warmer as a joke.  I had intended to trick my fellow employee, who was about to go on lunch break (we were allowed one free burger).  But before I could slap the fake burger on a tray for him, someone snagged it, put it in a bag, and handed it to a drive-through customer.  \n  \nWe never saw the customer again.  Somewhere, there's a person still pissed off that McDonalds sold the a soggy, hot, greasy, linen towel in place of a cheeseburger.  Honestly, as a former McDonalds employee I can state with full confidence that they got the better tasting option.  Still, it wasn't what they expected, and I hope that person would accept my sincere belated apology.",

I tried for two minutes and she said she wanted to not have sex tonight. I got it up a little later while we were still fooling around but the mood was killed and she didn\u2019t want to anymore.

We had a great date, nice restaurant, arcade, and chemistry was really strong physically. I got to her place and we started hooking up and after a few minutes of making out I realized my \ud83c\udf46 was not coming up. I tried for two minutes and she said she wanted to not have sex tonight. I got it up a little later while we were still fooling around but the mood was killed and she didn\u2019t want to anymore. Just cuddle. I got upset and asked her what was wrong because I wasn\u2019t sure if it was because I couldn\u2019t get it up or because she just didn\u2019t want to have sex. She got annoyed with me and I left. Next morning I apologized and she said it was just a misunderstanding and I can make it up on our second date. Now I\u2019m terrified and embarrassed and want to jump off a cliff. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: beautiful girl in my medical school class who I went on date with, hit it off with, went back to her place, got performance anxiety, now I feel incredibly insecure &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: just to lay it out, I didn\u2019t get aggressive with her or yell but u will admit I got upset but more like sad lol. I know it super immature everyone trust me I feel like a fool. That\u2019s just never happened to me before and I didn\u2019t know how to handle it. My dumb male ego wanted to \u201cprove myself\u201d to her when I should\u2019ve just focused on having fun with someone I care about. I deserve the hate but I\u2019m not totally clueless.

(Apparently these things are common but usually go to the insurance company - and I know she has that information, so it just feels like it was a deliberate decision to send it to my house rather than the company or their insurance.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#39;m upset all over again. My first accident would involve a Karen...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I struck a car belonging to a Karen, and she is taking it very personally.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "Today I was coming home and was in a right lane. There is a right turn I use to go home near a convenience store. I have used it many times for at least five years. There are zebra crossing lines where Pedestrians can walk in the lane I was about to turn into, but I never really noticed it. In fact, until today I never saw a pedestrian cross whenever I was about to turn, I guess I was lucky. In fact, I didn't even know what those lines were until I got home.\n\n  \nAnyway, onto what happened. I was turning basically on autopilot as soon as the light was green like I have many times before and suddenly I see a pedestrian crossing same street as that lane, taking me by surprise because it had never happened to me before in this particular turn. This person was staring forwards, and I stepped on the brakes, hoping that enough of my car was off the street so that the people behind me before I turned wouldn't smash into whatever part of my car was sticking out of the lane I had just begun to turn into. The guy was soon out of the way, and I stared ahead, hands clenching the wheel the whole way home. I sat in the car for a while checking to see if I broke the law and finding out what those stripes the guy was walking on for the first time since I began driving. \n\n  \nI am relieved that this didn't end in everyone getting hurt. The guy was already in the first of two lanes halfway across the street when I started turning IIRC, and with the way he was starring ahead I'm not sure if he even knew I was there. I am also glad that the back of my vehicle likely wasn't sticking out into the same lane as the traffic light I'd used to turn in the first place, blocking people or worse forcing them to stop to avoid getting banged on the side.\n\n  \nI still feel guilty. Is the whole thing my fault or should the pedestrian have checked both sides to see if anyone was coming before crossing? How likely is it that the police or courts will come for me for a traffic violation?\n\n  \nIt's a thing I do a lot, worrying about how past events that could have gone differently or didn't happen at all and how my life could've changed by them. This was most recent so I'm wondering, \"What if I hit the guy and he died? If he didn't die? What would my punishment be if I stayed and called 9/11? Could I have been imprisoned for years or even executed for his death?\" Or \"What if the other cars in the lane I used to turn kept coming and my car hadn't fully turned, would they have stopped in time or would they all crash in this massive pileup?\" I've been doing it more and more these days and I truly am scared that the day I fuck up in a way I can't take back might come. I know the past can't be changed and so I fear the possibility someone might actually die because if I make a mistake like this.\n\nTL;DR I turned right at a solid green light when driving when someone was crossing the street, and I feel I could have hit the pedestrian or caused a pileup and feel really guilty about it.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n",

I currently have a temp license and today was the day that I went to go to a driving test to get my full license. I live in ohio and have to go through Dead Man's Curve twice a day eight times a week, and I must say that it's definitely a hard turn for anyone, but my parents say that I handle the curve really good everytime I go through it. So when I went to go take my driving test today I had high hopes that I would pass. I did the first part (the maneuver ability test) really well, with only tapping a cone a little with the edge of the right side view mirror. Then the instructor had me do the road portion of the test, I stopped right before every stop sign and edged up to the road to check for any cars before continuing to either turn or keep going forward. Exept for one thing, I missed one fucking stop sign, I was focused on trying to keep in the speed limit (heavy foot syndrome is a bitch) and completely missed the one stop sign...  the instructor even said that I would've passed if I stopped for the stop sign. Now I have to attend four hours of instructor driving and 24 hours of driving with either of my parents.\n\n \nTL;DR: TIFU because I missed a stop sign\n\n\nNote: I'm not looking for pitty, I'm just a 18yr old trying to voice his annoyance. \n\nThank you for reading, have a beautiful day to all of you redditors\n\n-Kujo",

I'm equally close with both of them. All the names are fake.\n\n Sandra and I had a lot of issues throughout our friendship. We met when I was 14 and she was 16 so I was a pretty immature kid and did a lot of stupid stuff to her. We had a few massive fights and I didn't know how to handle my feelings about them so I ended up forwarding our private conversations to a whole bunch of people, some friends, some acquaintances. Sandra confronted me about this when she found out and ever since then I have been working hard to gain her trust back. I haven't forwarded a single message of hers to anyone since... until now.\n\nAbout 2 months ago Sandra and I had a pretty huge fight and it ended with her leaving a virtual choir that we were in together because she felt uncomfortable around me. She had texted the choir director saying that she left the group because I was making her uncomfortable. However, we ended up making up soon after and she returned to the choir. We haven't had a fight since.\n\n For a bit of context, the choir has a 3 strike system. If you get 3 strikes, then you will be kicked out. This is where Carly comes into the picture. She made a comment that made another choir member uncomfortable. This choir member also happens to be a close friend of mine. Carly frantically texted me, freaking out that she may have ended up on the choir strike system because of the comment she made. To make her feel better, I told her that I was probably also on the strike system due to my situation with Sandra, and that none of this was a big deal, we were all still in the choir and things were peaceful now. Carly, who already knew about my fight with Sandra, asked me if Sandra had told the choir director about our fight and how I was making her uncomfortable. Out of instinct, I simply just forwarded Carly the message from Sandra where she told me about telling the choir director. Carly responder with \"Oh shit,\" I emphasized the message, turned off my phone and went to bed.\n\nWhen I woke up this morning, the first thing I remembered was my conversation with Carly. I immediately realized that I had messed up, considering I had promised Sandra that I wouldn't forward her messages anymore yet I had forwarded one to Carly anyway. I immediately told Sandra about the situation and apologized. I really hope she doesn't get mad at me since I didn't talk crap about Sandra to Carly, all I did was answer Carly's message about Sandra telling the choir director about our fight, but I'm still terrified because I could have explained that to Carly without forwarding the message. Well, I guess I'll find out later, when I actually muster up the courage to turn my phone back on...\n\nTL;DR: I forwarded my friend's message after promising her that I would no longer do that and now I'm scared she might hate me.",

Sometime last year she started telling my dad (who I live with since my parents separated) that she wanted to spend time getting to know me and I should come spend the night at her flat so we can bond or whatever. I was hesitant at first cause I really don't like sleeping anywhere that's not my bed and I've just never been that close with my mom's side of the family since they're upper class snobbish types. \n\nThis time of year I have some free time and I thought \"why not get to know my kooky aunt?\" Because I will definitely be the kooky distant relative someday. (Also I'm trying to get my money up by hanging out with rich people tbvh). Anyway so I give her a call and tell her I'd like to come over in a few days and she was really excited, she almost didn't believe I called cause she gave me her number almost a year ago lol. So I'm going about my day, watching trashy reality TV, when my mom calls like an hour after I speak with my aunt and says my aunt told her I'm coming over.\n\nThis is where it gets weird... my mom tells me very ominously \"when you get there, be careful.\" \n\nWTF IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? I obviously ask her what she means and she continues very ominously, \"it's not a matter for over the phone.\" Ok so now my anxiety is conjuring the worst scenarios imaginable at my aunt's place, I'm legit imagining her as jigsaw. I'm thinking she's going to drug me and sell my organs on the black market. \n\nOnce I talk myself down from the true crime ledge (cause as much as my relationship with my mom is strained I don't think she'd be this vague if she actually thought I'd get murdered) I'm trying to figure out what she means so I keep asking. Eventually she just says \"You're an adult, you should know what I mean.\" BITCH\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffcSTOP\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffcBEING\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffcSO\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffcVAGUE\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nAfter this call I'm genuinely worried what she's talking about but I also think that my unmarried, childless aunt with 4 cats might be setting off lesbian alarm bells for my family and given that we live in a place where being gay could get you the death penalty I think maybe that's what she's trying to say in the most deranged way possible. I don't care if she's gay, it would literally be a non factor; but I would like to know if she has a habit of stabby sleepwalking or some shit before I go spend the night on her couch! \n\nTL;DR: I asked if I could stay at my aunt's flat and my mom gave me the most vague and ominous warning imaginable.",

I checked my CCTV and noticed that the last person who used the controller had just placed it on the couch. It was a black controller on a black couch, so it was perfectly camouflaged in the CCTV footage. After the game, one of the six guys placed his bag on the couch and put his black water bottle in it. As he was doing this, another guy stood directly between him and the camera, so his movements weren't clearly visible. However, I saw him turn the bag, pick a small black object off the couch, and place it inside the bag.

So I sent him a text explaining the situation and gave him time to call me back, or I would file a complaint with the police. He called me back and denied all my accusations. I thought he was lying but he was so confident that it made me doubt myself. I felt extremely guilty, so I went back to the CCTV footage and reviewed everything for five more hours.

MIL had a friend who was a long time secretary/office manager for the owner of a small but very successful commercial copier/printer company. They had an opening in management that would have been a dream for me at the time. She was able to get me an interview immediately with the owner. \n\nAlways hated job interviews. Get more nervous for those than literally anything. Pair that with how much I wanted this gig\u2026 I was a mess going in. \n\nShow up the day of. Meet the owner and I\u2019m 1 on 1 with him in his office. Guys mid 50s, easy to talk to, cool dude. Interview is super relaxed, he\u2019s laughing telling examples of things, even light heartedly cursing a couple times. I\u2019m still nervous on edge, but got more comfortable as it went on. \n\nThing was doing great, seemed like I was nailing it, then towards the end he says \u2018I ask this of everyone I interview, what\u2019s your go to ice breaker joke?\u2019 I still distinctly remember my rear end legitimately puckering up. I froze. Mind went blank. I don\u2019t really tell jokes. I don\u2019t really know any, and certainly don\u2019t have a go to one. I actually think I was about to faint or pass out, when I suddenly remembered the joke my wife\u2019s friend told us just the past weekend\u2026.\n\n\u2026.now I preface this by saying my wife\u2019s friend \u2018Jackie\u2019 is super nice, but very inappropriate pretty much all the time. Curses constantly, no shame with sex talk or jokes. We were walking with a small group into an MLB game once and as she walked passed a guy she found attractive she loudly declared \u2018God Damn I would drain his ballsack\u2019. Just one of dozens of one liners she\u2019s dropped. \n\nSo we saw her at a kids bday party of all places a few days prior, and she greets us with this calamity of a joke\u2026. \n\n\u2018What is another term for ejaculating in a woman? LOADING THE DISHWASHER\u2019. \n\nWife and I just scoffed a bit, shook our heads, said hi and moved on. \n\nBack to the interview\u2026 you guessed it. Sure enough in my panic, frozen state, feeling dizzy and potentially close to fainting, my mind identified that moment and that \u2018joke\u2019, and it just came out. The mix of my hysteria with the relaxed vibes the owner was giving out apparently gave my brain the idea that telling this joke was the move. I never talk like that. Like ever. It must have been just a last grasp of my subconscious to fill his request. \n\nHe stared at me for a few seconds. Had a look like a mix of astonishment and disgust. Finally just said \u2018ok then, well thanks for coming in\u2019. Stood up, shook my hand and opened the door for me. I walked out and the door shut right behind me. I just kept walking, through the rest of the office and out the front door straight to my car, got in, immediately pulled out and got out of there. I stopped at a convenience store a few minutes down the road, parked and just sat there, incredulous. \n\nNot only did I not get the job, which based on the interview up until that point I likely had a great chance at getting, but also I had to face my MIL, who obviously was told by her friend what happened. Wasn\u2019t exactly my finest moment.  \n\nTL;DR - was nailing an interview for a dream job, then I froze, and in a panic told an absurdly inappropriate joke I heard the previous weekend leaving everyone in a state of horror and disgust.

I stopped at a convenience store a few minutes down the road, parked and just sat there, incredulous. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only did I not get the job, which based on the interview up until that point I likely had a great chance at getting, but also I had to face my MIL, who obviously was told by her friend what happened. Wasn\u2019t exactly my finest moment.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - was nailing an interview for a dream job, then I froze, and in a panic told an absurdly inappropriate joke I heard the previous weekend leaving everyone in a state of horror and disgust. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "TIFU when yesterday (I know, not today) I moved out of my apartment that I had been living in with my fianc\u00e9, and telling her we were over. My mother and brother had breakfast with me the day of the break up and told me that my fianc\u00e9 was not right for me. I have been living with her for 8 months and have seen my family minimally because they live a couple hours away. Anyway, they kept telling me that I need to leave her because they claimed she was destroying my life, manipulating me, and not giving effort in the relationship. All to get to the point of me breaking up with her. I took my puppy from the apartment as well as all my possessions to my parents house, where I left originally because I was tired of the way they treated me. I (21M) moved out with my fianc\u00e9 (19F) to start our lives together, but now we are split up. I am living at my parents house and she is living at the apartment. I went to have a conversation with my fianc\u00e9 about moving forward, and to bring up the things my family wanted me to talk with her about: Taking over my own phone plan and splitting from hers, splitting rent down the middle instead of our budget schedule, and getting her car key back because the car is loaned and registered in my name, she is an insured driver of it. This all came to a screeching halt when I realized that \u201cwoah, I\u2019m allowed to have my own thoughts and feelings\u201d and I spoke with my fianc\u00e9 that we need to take some time to process the last year we had been together, and sort out some of our faults on our own time. We both want to be together, and have worked hard together for everything we have, so we want to circle back to a fresh start to the relationship. My mother wants me to ignore my fianc\u00e9 and to cut her off entirely as all my mother cares about is the money behind it. I still have great feelings for my fianc\u00e9, and I have so much ambition for our future. We do lift each other up as we are succeeding in college, and both work full time jobs. I argue that we are doing well for our age, but I do not know how to take the next step. I want to sort things out with myself to come back better for my fianc\u00e9, but I do not want to be in the tyrannical home of my parents and be trapped mentally and emotionally by my family. I feel that if I choose to go live a good life with my fianc\u00e9, my family will shut me out and have a grudge against me for the rest of my life. The way I see it, I would prefer to improve and fight to live a happy life with my woman rather than try to please my family. I fucked up\n\nTL;DR: TIFU by breaking up with my fianc\u00e9 after my family manipulated me into thinking she was bad for me. I now live separate from her, and we both want to improve to be a fantastic couple. I am in limbo because the moment I choose my fianc\u00e9, is the moment I disconnect likely entirely from my family.",

This all came to a screeching halt when I realized that \u201cwoah, I\u2019m allowed to have my own thoughts and feelings\u201d and I spoke with my fianc\u00e9 that we need to take some time to process the last year we had been together, and sort out some of our faults on our own time. We both want to be together, and have worked hard together for everything we have, so we want to circle back to a fresh start to the relationship. My mother wants me to ignore my fianc\u00e9 and to cut her off entirely as all my mother cares about is the money behind it. I still have great feelings for my fianc\u00e9, and I have so much ambition for our future. We do lift each other up as we are succeeding in college, and both work full time jobs. I argue that we are doing well for our age, but I do not know how to take the next step. I want to sort things out with myself to come back better for my fianc\u00e9, but I do not want to be in the tyrannical home of my parents and be trapped mentally and emotionally by my family. I feel that if I choose to go live a good life with my fianc\u00e9, my family will shut me out and have a grudge against me for the rest of my life. The way I see it, I would prefer to improve and fight to live a happy life with my woman rather than try to please my family. I fucked up&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: TIFU by breaking up with my fianc\u00e9 after my family manipulated me into thinking she was bad for me. I now live separate from her, and we both want to improve to be a fantastic couple. I am in limbo because the moment I choose my fianc\u00e9, is the moment I disconnect likely entirely from my family.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It was all packed into a barn across a rather large field so I had a tractor that I was using to move it all. As I was finishing packing it all up to drive across the large field I noticed that some people started to show up. I have no idea what they were there for but I got bad vibes and just generally wanted to avoid them. I attempted to drive the tractor kind quickly hoping to not be noticed, but of course some guy comes running up and just immediately starts digging through my stuff!!!! I crawl my way down the tractor and ask him what the fuck he\u2019s doing. He immediately gets confrontational and I start to yell while grabbing my stuff and putting it back on the tractor. He comes up behind me and wraps his arm around my neck which really freaks me out and of course I fight back and bite down on his arm. All of a sudden he starts yelling and pulling away and I\u2019m breathing deep staring into blackness. Then I hear my husband yelling what the fuck?!?! And I pull my sleep mask off my face and realize what had actually happened. I was having a very vivid dream while tucked in against my husband\u2019s chest with his arm around me. And in my sleep I had bit him. On the nipple. Pretty hard. He was upset, obviously, and I was upset because of my dream and we were both groggy and cranky from getting woken up so suddenly. \nTL;DR I had a bad dream and bit my husband in my sleep. ",

There\u2019s this small tunnel under some train tracks that connects two streets, and I was walking toward it on a shared bike-pedestrian path, listening to music. I hear a rental scooter behind me, ringing its bell. My music wasn\u2019t loud, so I could hear everything. I moved to the right as soon as I heard it to let the scooter pass and even gestured with my hand to show I was moving aside.\n\nAs I reached the tunnel, I glanced back to make sure everything was fine. But suddenly, the girl on the scooter, going at high speed, trips right in front of me. I felt bad, so I asked, \"Omg, are you okay?\" But she snapped, \"You moved in front of me, you fucking idiot.\"\n\nI don\u2019t like conflict, so I apologized again, asking if she was okay. Then she screams, \"OH, FUCK OFF.\" I was still trying to see if she needed help, but then she bends over and lets out this horror movie scream, I honestly had never seen something like that in real life. At this point, I was checking her arms and legs to see if she was injured, it seemed that she just tripped and quickly recovered. She was wearing a helmet, too, so it didn\u2019t seem like she had any serious injuries. I apologized again, but she yelled, \"FUCK OFF, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.\"\n\nAfter that, I started walking away slowly since she clearly didn\u2019t want me around. I heard her screaming again, \"FUUUUUUUCK, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.\" That\u2019s when I picked up the pace because I honestly thought she might retaliate. This happened just a few blocks from my house, so I took some side streets to make sure she didn\u2019t follow me.\n\nThe whole thing was really odd. I feel bad for her because it seemed like she was going through something bigger than just the fall. But honestly, she had no business going full speed in such a small tunnel (about 8 ft wide).\n\nI thought about posting this on AITA, but I feel like it was just one of those weird encounters. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have moved, maybe she shouldn\u2019t have been speeding. Either way, I\u2019m sure this left an impact on both of us.\n\n**TL;DR**: I tried to move aside for a scooter, the rider tripped, and then had a meltdown.",

But honestly, she had no business going full speed in such a small tunnel (about 8 ft wide).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about posting this on AITA, but I feel like it was just one of those weird encounters. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have moved, maybe she shouldn\u2019t have been speeding. Either way, I\u2019m sure this left an impact on both of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: I tried to move aside for a scooter, the rider tripped, and then had a meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I also recently underwent a huge storm in my area so I couldn\u2019t actually use my bathroom very frequently for the past like 3 days. He invites me over as he got power back before I did, and we haven\u2019t seen each other in about two weeks between the storm,life, travels. I go over, everything is fine, we get dinner and have a good time and then we start to kind of reel it in for bed. \n\nI go to the bathroom to shower and \u201cprep\u201d if you will for potential nighttime festivities. And prep I did. For, evidently, a different type of festivities. See those 3 days really smacked me all the sudden and there was no turning back. I figure - hey, first time for everything, a girls gotta go when a girls gotta go. I muster the courage to overcome my anxiety with using the toilet outside of my home. Mission accomplished. \n\nFlush that bastard down.\n\n\u2026.\nNope. Ok well sometimes you need a two-Fer right?? Maybe he didn\u2019t hear that first flush anyway\u2026the toilet gurgles at me in a laughably cruel way. No dice. Ok. Not the end of the world. Surely this guy has a plunger. \nNo. Not on the floor, not in the cabinet. I run out to the kitchen, maybe he\u2019s got one of those weird kitchen plungers?? Nope. \nHe\u2019s in the shower in the other bathroom. I wait for him, sheepishly, to finish up.\nIt\u2019s been a minute though, maybe- just maybe- the bathroom gods will have mercy on me, the 3rd flush will really just send my demon to its jail in hell. \n\n3rd flush. The toilet now roars at me, as it bubbles up WAY too quickly and begins to overflow everywhere and flood the bathroom (mercifully, just \u201cclean\u201d water as the monster was stuck down in the belly of the beast). My shower towel is a casualty in the battle, I try and fail to catch the waterfall of toilet water with it it\u2019s soaked through and now there is standing water around the basin. I am panicking, holding back tears as I realize I now have to directly ask this man for a plunger and somehow clean his bathroom which I have successfully demolished. \n\nHe finishes showering. Instead of approaching the situation with any sense of normalcy, I panic and say \u201chey! Just lay down I\u2019m gonna grab something from your master bathroom I think I need.\u201d He does so. He\u2019s so sweet. \n\nno plunger. my life is flashing before my eyes. I now finally cave \u201chey, do you have a plunger???\u201d \n\n\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d \n\nThe tears are involuntary as I laugh-cry at him, begging him not to help me, I mop and clean his entire bathroom while forcing him to stay in his bedroom. The bathroom is clean. The toilet has \u201cdrained\u201d enough to seem as though nothing has happened. I cannot calm down. He knows something has happened, I told him I flooded it, but not how. I\u2019m sure he can piece it together. \n\nThere are no nighttime festivities, I am too mortified to even look him in the eyes. The morning comes. My dignity is crushed and it is palpable. We part ways, he is still kind as ever and trying to laugh the situation off. I get home. I get a text.\n\n\u201cI am headed to the hardware store to get a plunger after flooding the bathroom again - who knew I needed one!\u201d \n\nPlease please just kill me now. \n\nTL;DR: I killed my dates bathroom with a monster shit and regrettably lived to tell the tale",

But, as a younger sister, kinda happy I\u2019ve annoyed my older brother. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR - I introduced Tom and Jerry to my young nephews. They loved it and decided to sing it first thing this morning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C-c-c-crambone!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We\u2019re all pretty social awkward, autistic or bad at picking up on social cues in one way or another.\u00a0 It\u2019s what helps us get along so well, I think, the shared experience.\u00a0 We play video games together, watch retro movies, play dnd, basically the textbook image of a group of nerds.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBoth Adrian and I are recent college graduates.\u00a0 He majored in a field that you can find a job in just about anywhere, but there are a few ideal opportunities for him within an hours drive.\u00a0 I, however, have a more niche career path.\u00a0 There are some remote options related to my major, but most things would be in a big city.\u00a0 We currently both live with our respective parents while looking for better prospects and are currently unemployed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAdrian is the closest friend I\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 We've been close for almost five years now.  Growing up I didn\u2019t have friends, let alone very close ones.\u00a0 Even in college, I was usually too busy to have that much time to socialize, and I frankly wasn\u2019t very good at it.\u00a0 This group is a bit of a lifesaver for me.\u00a0 And Adrian is the best friend I never had.\u00a0 He's imperfect, but when we became frineds, for the first time in my life I felt understood.  We\u2019re on the same wavelength about a lot of things.\u00a0 He really appreciates me and listens when I talk.\u00a0 We have a lot of the same interests, even deeper and more specific than the nerdy stuff the whole group likes.\u00a0 I love spending time with him.\u00a0 I always felt safe around him.  He's a wonderful person to be around and I\u2019ve never felt so close to someone.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s the unfortunate twist - I am aromantic and asexual.\u00a0 I\u2019m not very open about it, as I don\u2019t like explaining and justifying to people.\u00a0 I mean, its gotta be confusing, and especially since I\u2019m autistic, I have to sound like some sort of robot or alien when I explain it.\u00a0\u00a0I still love deeply, just not in a 'dating' sort of way.  But I openly support the queer community (I think I'm technically part of it?  Idk.) and Adrien is openly queer.  \n\nUnfortunately, I never told Adrien that I dont swing in any direction and he caught feelings.\u00a0 About a year ago, he asked me out.\u00a0 I can honestly say that I didn\u2019t see it coming.\u00a0 I\u2019m not great at reading others' feelings at the best of times, and when it\u2019s a feeling I quite literally haven\u2019t experienced, it\u2019s extremely difficult to navigate.\u00a0 It\u2019s blindsighted me a few times in the past with other people and I just haven\u2019t caught on yet.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI explained myself.  We talked through it.\u00a0 I said I'd probably never even be in a relationship at all, and that I wasn;t intersted in that sort of relationship with him.  I thought he understood, and things seemed normal.\u00a0 He seemed to treat me the same as he treated everyone else in the group.  I thought it was over and never really thought about it again.  I tried to read between all the lines of what he was saying, and I never caught anything that seemed too off.  \n\nA few months ago, he offhandedly mentioned getting an apartment together at some point.\u00a0 He\u2019s lived with a couple people in the friend group at this point, people he's had no interest in, so it didn\u2019t raise any red flags to me.\u00a0 The job market in the area is in shambles, so it was practical.\u00a0 It was vague, and felt more like coming up with future plans on the playground as a kid than anything concrete.  I don't remember exactly what I said, but I do remember it was affirmative but noncommittal, something like \u201cyeah, maybe\u201d.\u00a0 I remember bringing up how expensive rent is, and then the subject changed.\u00a0 It was never brought up again.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo here\u2019s where I fucked up today.\u00a0 \n\nWe went to our local games shop together to buy dice.\u00a0 It was the first time hanging out one-on-one in *ages (*it hadn't really happened much in the past year, due to a combination of our slightly uncomfortable conversation and senior year school work).  We were just hanging out and talking, walking around the store making jokes.  It felt like it used to.  \n\nWe commiserated over job hunting. \u00a0I brought up the horrid state of the job market, especially in my field.\u00a0 I noticed he was being extremely supportive, almost sickly sweet in how kind he was about assuring me that things would be fine.  I started to get a pit in my stomach, it was so genuine. \n\nDread churning inside, me I tried to continue the conversation, mentioning probably having to be in a big city like New York or San Francisco, both of which are well over 1000 miles from where we live.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnd then he hits me with \u201cWell, when we move in together, wherever that is, I can finally start looking for a job there.\u201d\n\nI pushed a little, and he expressed that he wasn\u2019t joking.\u00a0 He was genuinely planning on moving to wherever I get a job in my field to live with me.\u00a0 He said that he loves supporting me and what I do.  I kind of shut down after that.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t find the words.\u00a0 He's lived in this region his entire life.  He's never lived away from his parents.  He's never had a job in his life.  \n\nHe said if pay was tight, he could probably pay for it (via his parents), that he would do anything for me.  He even made a comment about how we should get one of the tapestries in the store for the hypothetical apartment, like he could already picture the space in his head.  It seemed like months of his repressed feelings spilling out in the middle of the store.  I left pretty soon after.\n\nDamn my complete lack of social awareness and willingness to believe he'd gotten over it.  And damn did I fuck up because I have no idea how to navigate this one, I\u2019ve just been staring at my computer screen since.  Adrien sent me a meme a little while ago, just the sort of message that is normal and doesn't allign with the closeness of what he said earlier.  I feel like I can\u2019t talk to him right now, and I regret not telling him that that\u2019s insane while I was in the moment.  I regret hanging out with him at all today. \n\nTLDR: Took a friend at face value when he said he was no longer romantically interested in me and started hanging out with him again, only to find out he\u2019s literally willing to pack up and move to wherever I am to be with me.\u00a0 I shut down and probably made it worse by not turning him down in the moment.\u00a0 ",

    "selftext": "It has been an interesting day, but I figured it would help me to let out an update on the whole situation involving me getting high while my friend's wife got drunk. In case you missed it, [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1g1sif3/tifu_by_letting_my_friend_watch_his_wife_get/) is the original post.\n\nI spoke to Fiona, my wife, about the whole situation, and she agreed with me- though a lot of what happened was no fault of my own, this type of situation shouldn't be repeated. I think what helped is that I emphasized how uncomfortable the whole situation made me feel, and I was as honest as I could be with her (leaving out the worst of it in order to not make things awkward). Fiona realizes that I didn't go in with this scenario in mind, and there wasn't exactly a safe way for me to exit the situation without souring my friendship with Garth and Cheri in some way. Fiona and I made the agreement that if I repeat such an event with Cheri, there's going to be at least one other friend present (whether said third friend is sober, drunk, or tripping, was not specified).\n\nI also reached out to Garth, my friend, and apologized for any discomfort I may have caused him, and I told him that I wasn't intending to repeat such an incident again. That I felt like I had disrespected him in his own home. He responded to me along these lines, \"*It's alright, it's not your fault, we are good. I know who's fault it is.*\" Which is a bit cryptic but I decided to leave it at that, because if Garth says we're cool, I don't want to make it uncool by digging any deeper. We have Burning Wheel night this week, so I'll be able to gauge how things are between us at that point.\n\nI then contacted Cheri, Garth's wife, just to confirm how she felt about the situation, and to confirm with her that Garth was ok with it. She cheerfully responded, \"Oh, he was a bit grumpy, but that's just because he thinks those movies are super dumb.\" She then casually suggested that next time we do it it should just be the two of us on a night when Garth is going out, \"So that he doesn't get grumpy about the movies,\" and that she wants to hit 5 drinks next time. I then told her that I would prefer to have another person there, and she was like, \"Hmm. Have it your way I guess.\" So I don't know. I'm flattered that Cheri wants to spend quality time with me. But I also have no desire to be in a situation where my mind is inebriated and imagining horrifically awkward social vibes, even if those vibes aren't there from anyone else's perspective.\n\nTL;DR After my awkward evening where I was high and my friend's wife was drunk, I unpacked everything. My wife and I made agreements that I won't be alone with her again. My friend and I made up even if it was a bit cryptic. My friend's wife seemed unfazed and wanted to repeat the experience, but seemed miffed when I said I'd only do it if someone else was there.",

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been an interesting day, but I figured it would help me to let out an update on the whole situation involving me getting high while my friend&amp;#39;s wife got drunk. In case you missed it, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1g1sif3/tifu_by_letting_my_friend_watch_his_wife_get/\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; is the original post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Fiona, my wife, about the whole situation, and she agreed with me- though a lot of what happened was no fault of my own, this type of situation shouldn&amp;#39;t be repeated. I think what helped is that I emphasized how uncomfortable the whole situation made me feel, and I was as honest as I could be with her (leaving out the worst of it in order to not make things awkward). Fiona realizes that I didn&amp;#39;t go in with this scenario in mind, and there wasn&amp;#39;t exactly a safe way for me to exit the situation without souring my friendship with Garth and Cheri in some way. Fiona and I made the agreement that if I repeat such an event with Cheri, there&amp;#39;s going to be at least one other friend present (whether said third friend is sober, drunk, or tripping, was not specified).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also reached out to Garth, my friend, and apologized for any discomfort I may have caused him, and I told him that I wasn&amp;#39;t intending to repeat such an incident again. That I felt like I had disrespected him in his own home. He responded to me along these lines, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s alright, it&amp;#39;s not your fault, we are good. I know who&amp;#39;s fault it is.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; Which is a bit cryptic but I decided to leave it at that, because if Garth says we&amp;#39;re cool, I don&amp;#39;t want to make it uncool by digging any deeper. We have Burning Wheel night this week, so I&amp;#39;ll be able to gauge how things are between us at that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then contacted Cheri, Garth&amp;#39;s wife, just to confirm how she felt about the situation, and to confirm with her that Garth was ok with it. She cheerfully responded, &amp;quot;Oh, he was a bit grumpy, but that&amp;#39;s just because he thinks those movies are super dumb.&amp;quot; She then casually suggested that next time we do it it should just be the two of us on a night when Garth is going out, &amp;quot;So that he doesn&amp;#39;t get grumpy about the movies,&amp;quot; and that she wants to hit 5 drinks next time. I then told her that I would prefer to have another person there, and she was like, &amp;quot;Hmm. Have it your way I guess.&amp;quot; So I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;m flattered that Cheri wants to spend quality time with me. But I also have no desire to be in a situation where my mind is inebriated and imagining horrifically awkward social vibes, even if those vibes aren&amp;#39;t there from anyone else&amp;#39;s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR After my awkward evening where I was high and my friend&amp;#39;s wife was drunk, I unpacked everything. My wife and I made agreements that I won&amp;#39;t be alone with her again. My friend and I made up even if it was a bit cryptic. My friend&amp;#39;s wife seemed unfazed and wanted to repeat the experience, but seemed miffed when I said I&amp;#39;d only do it if someone else was there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It\u2019s important to note that me and this friend don\u2019t know eachother nor see eachother very often, were basically situational friends that hang out when our parents decided to see eachother. Today we decided to hang out one on one for the first time as it turned out we were both into lost places/urban exploring. \n\nTo get into this building, we had to jump a pretty tall metal fence, and since i am quite short i needed him to jump it first so he can help me get down from the other side. (This is important). \n\nOnce we get in, we start exploring, this building was very big so we spent about 2h going around until we got to the basement where we sat down in a little nook. There, he started to get physically close to me (not something he\u2019s ever done before) and started asking me romantic and sexual questions about relationships and my sex life etc. etc. until he confessed and asked if he could kiss me. I said no. He then attempted to persuade me by saying that it\u2019s \"just a kiss\" and that i should \"loosen up\" and stop \"taking life too seriously\" (average teenage boy speech). I repeatedly said no and that im not interested in him like that. He then got a little upset and refuses to get up since he knew i was dependent on him to get out due to the fence situation, this made me very uncomfortable and scared to where i basically begged him to start going as it was getting late and cold.\n\nthis is where i fucked up:\nonce we make it out the window and by the fence, he jumps over first so he can help me down. It\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s a metal fence where the metal doesn\u2019t stick out the same way on both sides, so it was much more difficult to get out than to get in. Once he makes it over, i start climbing up but keep slipping, once im almost finally at the top, my shirt gets caught on a piece of the metal that\u2019s sticking out on the top and i slip with an almost cartoonish ripping sound, leaving me hanging to the fence by my shirt and bra that are now only around my neck with my whole upper body exposed while this dude just stares from across the fence. i proceed to struggle for a few seconds while this dude STANDS AND LAUGHS until i give up and slip out of my shirt and bra completely, leaving me completely shirtless in a german FALL at night, while he just stands on the opposite side of the fence staring and kind of laughing. I eventually make it over the fence, still shirtless, and he gives me his jacket. On the way back he constantly made comments like \"you didn\u2019t want to kiss me but you gave me that without even asking! heheheh!\" and various remarks on how i looked basically hung up naked. not planning on seeing that guy anytime soon.\n\ntl;dr \nfriend confessed his unreciprocated feelings for me in an abandoned building and while jumping over the fence to get out my shirt and bra ripped leaving me completely exposed, like a fucking scene from an anime.",

    "selftext": "Had a rare night out in DTLA to me friends from my hometown. I paid $25 for 2.5 hours at a lot next to the brewery, truly thinking I wasn\u2019t going to stay out past that. \nThen I started drinking and having fun, another friend shows up, and just lost track of time. \nWhen I finally start walking to the parking lot at 12:45am, I remember my mistake and brace myself, expecting to see a hefty ticket on my windshield. \n\nNope. My car was gone. I panic, look around and can\u2019t find the tow truck name or phone number posted anywhere. I call the parking lot number and they direct me to where I need to go. \n\nThankfully, my friend was with me and  drives me less than 2 miles to the impound lot and I\u2019m told it\u2019s going to cost $512 to get it back. I almost fall to my knees. \n\nMy ticket says it expired at 10:21 PM and the form they gave me says my car was towed at 11:42 PM but the \u201cday held in impound\u201d says 2 days\u2026 how it makes sense is beyond me. \n\nInstead of paying $5 for the extra 2 hours, it ended up costing me $512. Lesson learned. I hate DTLA.\n\nTL;DR: didn\u2019t pay for the right amount of parking, had to pay $512 for towed car. \n\nEdit: since everyone wants to accuse me of drinking and driving, I want to add that I only had 2 beers starting at 8pm and stopped drinking altogether by 11:30pm because I knew I\u2019d be driving home. At not point was I \u201cdrunk\u201d. ",

I paid $25 for 2.5 hours at a lot next to the brewery, truly thinking I wasn\u2019t going to stay out past that. \nThen I started drinking and having fun, another friend shows up, and just lost track of time. \nWhen I finally start walking to the parking lot at 12:45am, I remember my mistake and brace myself, expecting to see a hefty ticket on my windshield. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope. My car was gone. I panic, look around and can\u2019t find the tow truck name or phone number posted anywhere. I call the parking lot number and they direct me to where I need to go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, my friend was with me and  drives me less than 2 miles to the impound lot and I\u2019m told it\u2019s going to cost $512 to get it back. I almost fall to my knees. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My ticket says it expired at 10:21 PM and the form they gave me says my car was towed at 11:42 PM but the \u201cday held in impound\u201d says 2 days\u2026 how it makes sense is beyond me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of paying $5 for the extra 2 hours, it ended up costing me $512. Lesson learned. I hate DTLA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: didn\u2019t pay for the right amount of parking, had to pay $512 for towed car. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: since everyone wants to accuse me of drinking and driving, I want to add that I only had 2 beers starting at 8pm and stopped drinking altogether by 11:30pm because I knew I\u2019d be driving home. At not point was I \u201cdrunk\u201d. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I wanted more specific advice as I've been confused about how to handle this situation so here goes..\n\nI dated my partner for 8 months. We had a break after 3 months as I struggled to maintain the relationship after frequent break up conversations. Our communication improved when we got back together but I felt numb and strange a couple months into being together again. There is a lot of love there but I decided to ask for a break as I am moving home for two months and didn't want to ruin the relationship with long-distance as we had spoken about how it wouldn't work for us.\n\nAfter going on a break for a few days, we ended up breaking up instead as the break didn't have a clear end. It was hard to process as I wanted to keep making the relationship work but I felt I needed the space to understand why I wasn't feeling myself for these past months. I had definitely been neglecting my self-care and my own friends and family. I thought my issues with anxiety and deperssion were also affecting how I felt in the relationship.\n\nDue to the nature of our break up and neither side wanting it to end, we have remained friends and continued to nurture a relationship with one another. We went a week where we weren't speaking very much and it felt horrible. After that, we bumped into each other, had an awkward encounter then agreed to spend time together to see if it was a relationship worth continuing. Then we slept together.\n\nAfter a lot of talks, we have agreed that we want to stay close while letting each other explore our personal roads to peace and contentment, whatever form this takes. I want to ask yous, how do you know when to stop being friends? The relationship wasn't bad in any way, I just felt something missing for myself and I can identify clearly why I felt that way. Now I'm going home for two months, I want to spend as much time with him appreciating our connection rather than fighting the urge to spend time with him, making myself even more miserable. But I also know that trying to keep our relationship immediately could be severing our future connection to each other.  \nAny advice would be appreciated&lt;3\n\nTL;DR can you be friends with an ex in a healthy way and keep a connection if your break up wasn't toxic?",

    "selftext": "\\[*Trigger Warning - Alcohol and Drug use*\\] Alright so this whole ordeal just took place over the past several hours, and I'm still reeling. I'm writing this out to try to help me process what the fuck happened.\n\nFor some context- I (29M) am married. My friends relevant to this situation, Garth (29M) and Cheri (24F), are married to each other. Garth and I are good friends and we play Burning Wheel and other such TTRPGs together with a group of guys. Cheri and I are also quite close and we share a lot of similar interests. We're both creative, like art and gaming, etc, there's just a lot that makes us click in ways that Garth and I don't. And that's fine. We're all friends and it seems to be all good.\n\nOne day Cheri and I were messaging as we often do, and she suggested a \"fun night idea\" to me, namely, that she gets drunk and I trip out on mushrooms, and we do it together while watching a few dumb movies. In and of itself, that sounded hilarious and I thought it would be pretty fun. I'm not a drinker, I had never even been around someone who had been drunk before. Cheri likes her drinks but had only seen me dose mushrooms once before on a very low dose. I guess she was curious about us being together while under the influence, and I can't deny that I felt an inexplicable desire to investigate such an experience as well. So it seemed like a good plan and we made the arrangements.\n\nI decided to be honest with my wife, Fiona, about our plans. She was hesitant at first. There's been awkward moments between the four of us as couples before (although lines were never truly crossed), so I don't blame her. But after I made it clear that Garth would be there, she was ok with it and told me simply to tell her how it went afterward. Well, let's start by saying, \"*it went.*\" **Cue a long string of awkward fuckups that would last the entire evening.**\n\nThe first fuckup was that when I showed up, Garth wasn't home. It was only me and Cheri. She'd just put her kids to bed 30min before, and Garth was working late apparently. Which felt a little bit awkward, being alone with her, but I shrugged it off since she seemed so innocuous and nonchalant about it. I took my mushrooms and she had her first drink of the evening, and we put on a movie of her choosing which we had both agreed would probably be funny and dumb. Cheri had rearranged their living room so that the 2-seater loveseat was facing the TV instead of the normal 3-seater couch. I don't know if she did it just for that day or if it had been like that all week, since the last time I had been there they'd had the 3-seater couch across from the TV and the loveseat off to one side. This meant that we were sitting closer together. As the shrooms kicked in, every time she'd speak to me and I would turn to her I would see her hair floating up a bit like waves of reddish-orange and her skin was taking on an undeniably attractive hue. These effects are par for the course though so I wasn't concerned about that.\n\nI was peaking on the trip by the time she was starting her third drink. I don't know alcohol because I don't drink, and in my current state I was unable to discern whether she was playing up the alcohol or if she is just a lightweight. She kept giggling and laughing, leaning on me and touching me a lot. Meanwhile I was really struggling to 'zen' through this; it was like I realized there was a disconnect between our sources of inebriation. Cheri asked me to feel her hair because she saw I was staring at it and I had explained to her what it looked like visually. It felt really soft and nice. My serotonin receptors were going off like mad and in my mind, it felt like I had never seen a more beautiful and lovely person in my life. I told Cheri this, and it made her laugh uproariously and pretty much fall on top of me from laughter. She remained physically close and leaning against me for a while, and in my psychological state it felt like her body was melting into mine.\n\nGarth came home just as Cheri had cracked open her fourth drink. She happily got up and kissed him at the door. I said Hello, and he acknowledged me and went straight to the shower. I'm not sure how long he was in there, but the time dilation made it feel so long that I had completely forgotten he was even in the house by the time he came out. It was just me and Cheri being silly and watching a dumb movie. When Garth came out, he sat on the 3-seater couch by himself and was eating a meal Cheri had made earlier. He then made some kind of complaint about the meal, which she dismissed nonchalantly, and it was at that very moment that I started feeling awkward. Suddenly, I couldn't shake this idea that it was like he was watching me have a date with his wife, and going farther, right in front of him. Cheri didn't change her physical behavior much, despite his presence, except to stop leaning against me as profusely she had been. She also mentioned, right in front of Garth, that this was \"the drunkest she had been in a long time.\"\n\nFrom my time-dilated perspective, it felt like YEARS for Cheri to finish her fourth drink. And the whole time, Garth sat off to the side, on his phone. In my mental state, I couldn't stop thinking that he was *furious* at us. Cheri tried to involve him in conversation several times but he kind of ignored her, and I think the only thing I directly recall him saying was, \"This movie is the stupidest shit ever.\" Eventually Garth left the room for the evening and I didn't see him again. Cheri continued her drunken shenanigans and a lot of physical contact. As I was coming down from the trip she started eating a lot of pretzels and drinking a lot of water, which she explained to me was to make sure she wouldn't be so hung over the next day.\n\nWe spent about half an hour in deeper conversation after we were both done our respective substances. Cheri seemed completely happy with the whole experience and I couldn't sense any awkwardness from her. She happily talked about how we can do it next time, and agreed that she'd pound a drink back shortly before I arrived so that we'd be synchronized at our respective \"intoxication\" points. But I felt awkward as FUCK. I left their house feeling like I'd had emotional &amp; psychological sex with my friend's wife right in front of him. I told Fiona when I got home that I had to \"process\" the whole experience before I could articulate to her what it was like. She's curious but not overly concerned, but I'm not sure how she'll feel after I explain what happened. And now here I am, trying myself to process what actually happened, where things went wrong, and how the fuck I'm going to share all this with Fiona (or which parts I omit).\n\nTL;DR I hung out with my friend's wife and watched a movie while we were drunk and high, and it was awkward as shit and I felt like I was cheating right in front of my friend.",

My friends relevant to this situation, Garth (29M) and Cheri (24F), are married to each other. Garth and I are good friends and we play Burning Wheel and other such TTRPGs together with a group of guys. Cheri and I are also quite close and we share a lot of similar interests. We&amp;#39;re both creative, like art and gaming, etc, there&amp;#39;s just a lot that makes us click in ways that Garth and I don&amp;#39;t. And that&amp;#39;s fine. We&amp;#39;re all friends and it seems to be all good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day Cheri and I were messaging as we often do, and she suggested a &amp;quot;fun night idea&amp;quot; to me, namely, that she gets drunk and I trip out on mushrooms, and we do it together while watching a few dumb movies. In and of itself, that sounded hilarious and I thought it would be pretty fun. I&amp;#39;m not a drinker, I had never even been around someone who had been drunk before. Cheri likes her drinks but had only seen me dose mushrooms once before on a very low dose. I guess she was curious about us being together while under the influence, and I can&amp;#39;t deny that I felt an inexplicable desire to investigate such an experience as well. So it seemed like a good plan and we made the arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to be honest with my wife, Fiona, about our plans. She was hesitant at first. There&amp;#39;s been awkward moments between the four of us as couples before (although lines were never truly crossed), so I don&amp;#39;t blame her. But after I made it clear that Garth would be there, she was ok with it and told me simply to tell her how it went afterward. Well, let&amp;#39;s start by saying, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;it went.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;Cue a long string of awkward fuckups that would last the entire evening.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first fuckup was that when I showed up, Garth wasn&amp;#39;t home. It was only me and Cheri. She&amp;#39;d just put her kids to bed 30min before, and Garth was working late apparently. Which felt a little bit awkward, being alone with her, but I shrugged it off since she seemed so innocuous and nonchalant about it. I took my mushrooms and she had her first drink of the evening, and we put on a movie of her choosing which we had both agreed would probably be funny and dumb. Cheri had rearranged their living room so that the 2-seater loveseat was facing the TV instead of the normal 3-seater couch. I don&amp;#39;t know if she did it just for that day or if it had been like that all week, since the last time I had been there they&amp;#39;d had the 3-seater couch across from the TV and the loveseat off to one side. This meant that we were sitting closer together. As the shrooms kicked in, every time she&amp;#39;d speak to me and I would turn to her I would see her hair floating up a bit like waves of reddish-orange and her skin was taking on an undeniably attractive hue. These effects are par for the course though so I wasn&amp;#39;t concerned about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was peaking on the trip by the time she was starting her third drink. I don&amp;#39;t know alcohol because I don&amp;#39;t drink, and in my current state I was unable to discern whether she was playing up the alcohol or if she is just a lightweight. She kept giggling and laughing, leaning on me and touching me a lot. Meanwhile I was really struggling to &amp;#39;zen&amp;#39; through this; it was like I realized there was a disconnect between our sources of inebriation. Cheri asked me to feel her hair because she saw I was staring at it and I had explained to her what it looked like visually. It felt really soft and nice. My serotonin receptors were going off like mad and in my mind, it felt like I had never seen a more beautiful and lovely person in my life. I told Cheri this, and it made her laugh uproariously and pretty much fall on top of me from laughter. She remained physically close and leaning against me for a while, and in my psychological state it felt like her body was melting into mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Garth came home just as Cheri had cracked open her fourth drink. She happily got up and kissed him at the door. I said Hello, and he acknowledged me and went straight to the shower. I&amp;#39;m not sure how long he was in there, but the time dilation made it feel so long that I had completely forgotten he was even in the house by the time he came out. It was just me and Cheri being silly and watching a dumb movie. When Garth came out, he sat on the 3-seater couch by himself and was eating a meal Cheri had made earlier. He then made some kind of complaint about the meal, which she dismissed nonchalantly, and it was at that very moment that I started feeling awkward. Suddenly, I couldn&amp;#39;t shake this idea that it was like he was watching me have a date with his wife, and going farther, right in front of him. Cheri didn&amp;#39;t change her physical behavior much, despite his presence, except to stop leaning against me as profusely she had been. She also mentioned, right in front of Garth, that this was &amp;quot;the drunkest she had been in a long time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From my time-dilated perspective, it felt like YEARS for Cheri to finish her fourth drink. And the whole time, Garth sat off to the side, on his phone. In my mental state, I couldn&amp;#39;t stop thinking that he was &lt;em&gt;furious&lt;/em&gt; at us. Cheri tried to involve him in conversation several times but he kind of ignored her, and I think the only thing I directly recall him saying was, &amp;quot;This movie is the stupidest shit ever.&amp;quot; Eventually Garth left the room for the evening and I didn&amp;#39;t see him again. Cheri continued her drunken shenanigans and a lot of physical contact. As I was coming down from the trip she started eating a lot of pretzels and drinking a lot of water, which she explained to me was to make sure she wouldn&amp;#39;t be so hung over the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We spent about half an hour in deeper conversation after we were both done our respective substances. Cheri seemed completely happy with the whole experience and I couldn&amp;#39;t sense any awkwardness from her. She happily talked about how we can do it next time, and agreed that she&amp;#39;d pound a drink back shortly before I arrived so that we&amp;#39;d be synchronized at our respective &amp;quot;intoxication&amp;quot; points. But I felt awkward as FUCK. I left their house feeling like I&amp;#39;d had emotional &amp;amp; psychological sex with my friend&amp;#39;s wife right in front of him. I told Fiona when I got home that I had to &amp;quot;process&amp;quot; the whole experience before I could articulate to her what it was like. She&amp;#39;s curious but not overly concerned, but I&amp;#39;m not sure how she&amp;#39;ll feel after I explain what happened. And now here I am, trying myself to process what actually happened, where things went wrong, and how the fuck I&amp;#39;m going to share all this with Fiona (or which parts I omit).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I hung out with my friend&amp;#39;s wife and watched a movie while we were drunk and high, and it was awkward as shit and I felt like I was cheating right in front of my friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Or like they were being annoying and wanted them to go away.\n\n A couple of weeks of saying that phrase later... I was told by my boss that I had said something very vulgar and that I would be getting a write up soon when an HR member was available. I was astonished. I am very southern and sometimes I just let things slip casually.\n\nThis week I learned that \"See you next Tuesday\" was actually code for calling someone a cunt. A word I never use. It's very disrespectful.  \n  \nSkip to today and I am sitting in the meeting with my boss and HR. I find out that I said this vulgar word in the same conversation that my employee also got wrote up for calling someone a \"fragile bitch.\" They explained to me how we cannot have this kind of language in the warehouse and that in conversation words can be chosen poorly and this was just a bad decision to use the word. I agreed that yes whatever I said must have been bad. The entire time I just cannot remember what I would have said that would garnish a final warning but I agreed to sign the paper and understood that if I had said something vulgar then yea I should be written up.

    "selftext": "Ok so this happened about two hours ago and I don't have anyone to talk about it so I decided to post here. English is not my fist language and I am still shaking from what happened so I apologise for any mistakes.\n\nI (20m) got my driver's license about 5 months ago but since I don't own a car I almost never used it. I would occasionally take my dad's car to drive very short distances but that was it. However, I still felt pretty confident until today. I had already noticed a problem in the car where, if it is on a slope facing down and I put it on reverse, it will still move forwards when I take my foot out of the brake pedal, which means I have to quickly press on the accelerator for it to go backwards and stop moving forwards. However since it only happened one time I thought maybe it wasn't that big of an issue specially because I never used the car (BIG mistake). Today my dad told me to park the car inside of the garage because it was parked in front of my house, which is on a slope, and there was a delivery van parked right in front of it. So I got in the car, and turned it on, except it didn't turn on, only the panel lit up, not the engine. As I said, since I don't usually use the car, this hadn't happened a lot of times before, and most importantly not on a slope. Then, the guy who was doing the deliveries with the van told me to back up, I was already going to so I proceded with him in front of the car. As soon as I took the car out of parking mode and on reverse, it started to move forwards, but when I pressed on the accelerator for it to go backwards, the car continued to move forwards. I quickly slammed the brakes but since the engine was off the brake pedals were really stiff and didn't make the car stop fast enough to avoid hitting the poor dude. His leg got stuck between his van and mine, and he was yelling for me to reverse because my car was still pressing against his leg. I swear to god, I was trying my hardest but I was so scared and desperate that I couldn't even process what was happening. Since the engine was off the only way to get the car to go backwards was to turn it on, but I was to scared that I couldn't even understand what was the isse. It got to a point where I left my car and went to his side and started to try and push it up the slope to free his leg (I know this is stupid as fuck but I had never been this desperate in my entire life). By a miracle some guy passing by the street saw what was happening, got in my car and was able to turn it on and reverse it. When his leg finally became unstuck, I immediately collapsed to the ground shaking. I kept apologizing to the guy and he was surprisingly chill about all of it. I thought his leg would have at least broken but he was able to stand and walk, he just said it was hurting like a mf. I offered to take him to the hospital a million times but he said it was fine. I gave him my number so that I can pay for his medical expenses but it still didn't feel like enough, idk I was expecting him to freak out on me (which would have been 100% understandable) but he accepted my apologies imediately. I didn't even know how to feel. I am feeling guilty as fuck and, to be honest, I fully deserve it. Imagine if there was a kid in front of the car, I'm shaking just by imagining that. I guess I won't be driving for a long time. \n\nTL;DR: I (20M) rarely drive and had an accident today while trying to reverse my dad's car on a slope. The engine was off, causing the brakes to stiffen, and the car moved forward, trapping a delivery man's leg between my car and his van. Thankfully, a passerby helped turn the car on to reverse, and the delivery man wasn\u2019t seriously injured, but I feel extremely guilty and won\u2019t be driving for a while.\n\n",

The problem started this morning, my mom had left some muscle relaxants in my room for anytime I felt sore from work, after working for a while I had gotten used to the burn of the job, but for whatever reason I decided to take the muscle relaxants before work.\n\nWhen I got to work I started stacking boxes and doing the usual work you'd imagine UPS workers do (I guarantee you it's exactly what you think it is except with boxes that are between 20-100lb), until I started feeling the strength in my arms weakening, my legs were aching and my lower back would start feeling like it was squeezing together, it was a weird feeling. For a bit I tried powering through it assuming it was just me needing to fix my posture while I lift and using my legs more, but the feeling was growing more and more, then I remembered taking the muscle relaxants and realizing that my body was relaxing itself while I worked out.\n\nTo confirm my suspicions, I looked it up really quick on my phone and unfortunately, my mistake could've risked an injury and caused me to pull something a lot easier than usual. Embarrassed, I looked for a manager to tell them about my mistake, then they asked me a few questions to confirm that I wasn't BSing them until they decided that i should go home. Naturally, I would be okay with going home, but I felt so stupid having to leave my job not even 30 minutes before it even started because of my lack of knowledge on the appropriate time to take muscle relaxants. \n\nThe only reason I felt like sharing this in this subreddit is because I'm afraid of losing this job that I frankly fell in love with because of a stupid slip up, I also think I have a greater chance of getting fired because I'm still in the probation stage of my job, not that this has happened before, but I think this might be plenty of reason to let me go. At the same time, I didn't want to risk an injury and make myself a liability to them because of this. Regardless, I lost my hours for the day, and I feel like a complete idiot...",

Naturally, I would be okay with going home, but I felt so stupid having to leave my job not even 30 minutes before it even started because of my lack of knowledge on the appropriate time to take muscle relaxants. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only reason I felt like sharing this in this subreddit is because I&amp;#39;m afraid of losing this job that I frankly fell in love with because of a stupid slip up, I also think I have a greater chance of getting fired because I&amp;#39;m still in the probation stage of my job, not that this has happened before, but I think this might be plenty of reason to let me go. At the same time, I didn&amp;#39;t want to risk an injury and make myself a liability to them because of this. Regardless, I lost my hours for the day, and I feel like a complete idiot...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I let the update begin but my cell signal was really weak and was taking forever to update.

I will remember you always; you are the GOAT \u2764\ufe0f\n\nBesides having to run the ABSOLUTE GAUNTLET of social anxiety, I also scratched the left lens of my glasses, which suuuuuuucks because I'm still paying for this pair in installments, and November was gonna be my last payment \ud83d\ude2d Hopefully maybe the optometrist can just polish out the scratches or something.

In reality, he is used to me wandering in there while he is gaming, so since I didn't say anything (because choking) he just kept playing League of Legends \ud83d\ude02 Tbf if I had reached the chair and grabbed him by the shoulder he definitely would have realised there was something wrong, but I managed to dislodge the carrot just before I got to his desk.\n\nIt actually lead to a funny habit we have now, where if one of us needs attention and affection we sometimes go to the other and very dramatically pretend to swoon while saying \"OMG I'm LItEraLly DyINg and you don't even notice meeeee!\" I love this human so much \ud83e\udd70\n\nEXTRA TL;DR: I am bad at eating things, apparently.

I will remember you always; you are the GOAT \u2764\ufe0f&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides having to run the ABSOLUTE GAUNTLET of social anxiety, I also scratched the left lens of my glasses, which suuuuuuucks because I&amp;#39;m still paying for this pair in installments, and November was gonna be my last payment \ud83d\ude2d Hopefully maybe the optometrist can just polish out the scratches or something. I&amp;#39;m never going out in public again \ud83d\ude02&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Ice-cream is for swallowing, not breathing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ACTUAL TL;DR: Inhaled while eating an ice-cream cone, coughed so hard that I fainted in public in front of strangers and broke my very expensive glasses&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: OMG this actually reminded me of another dumb story \ud83d\ude02 I once was in the kitchen when I started choking (not inhaling this time, actual choking) on a piece of carrot, so I stumbled into my spouse&amp;#39;s room thinking he was going to save me with the Heimlich maneuver. In reality, he is used to me wandering in there while he is gaming, so since I didn&amp;#39;t say anything (because choking) he just kept playing League of Legends \ud83d\ude02 Tbf if I had reached the chair and grabbed him by the shoulder he definitely would have realised there was something wrong, but I managed to dislodge the carrot just before I got to his desk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It actually lead to a funny habit we have now, where if one of us needs attention and affection we sometimes go to the other and very dramatically pretend to swoon while saying &amp;quot;OMG I&amp;#39;m LItEraLly DyINg and you don&amp;#39;t even notice meeeee!&amp;quot; I love this human so much \ud83e\udd70&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EXTRA TL;DR: I am bad at eating things, apparently. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

YOUREEEE JOKING A DOUBLE WHAMMY\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d so at this point im just like yeah im going to be single forever. and so i start driving absolutely horrified and he says this: \u201chey look at the bright side, at least you didnt shit yourself\u201d. WHAT. LMAO HE THINKS IT WAS ALL MY PERIOD AND NO CACA??? i really hope when i dropped him off and he cleans up that he continues to think that. he said in the car a couple of times like dont worry about it, it happens, but i just have this gut feeling that this arrangement is coming to a close. which sucks because i actually like him but that story is for another day. so there you have it, laying in bed, 4:30 in the morning, have an exam at 11, cramps killing, hate myself.\n\nTL;DR had sex in the car with my fwb and shat myself and started my period. he thinks i didnt shit myself and that it was all just period related mess. \n\n2 days later update: so far, ive only seen him just once in the cafeteria at school, he seemed normal towards me\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but yeah we havent texted at all he snapped me once but thats all normal too so i guess we will continue to wait and see\n\nupdate: me and my friends noticed he turned off his snap location for only me and not anyone else in the friendgroup\u2026 guys its not looking good\n\n update: it\u2019s been over a week and he\u2019s ignoring me in person and has stopped contacting me through every social! so cute!",

    "selftext": "So a couple of weeks ago I had this weird dream, which was mostly normal, except that it was a sort of sex dream(?) I had about a childhood friend. Idk if it counts as that, I didn\u2019t dream about actually having sex with him but rather I knew that we had in both dreams(I had two different dreams months apart). The first time I thought I could like him because at the time one of my friends had mentioned that he(the friend the dream was about) was basically my ideal type. I explained to her that while he did seem that way on the surface I had never thought of him in such a way in all the years I\u2019ve known him, and that I guess I wasn\u2019t as superficial as others think I am since the main reason I never thought of him that way is his personality. I can put up with it and find it funny as a friend, but it\u2019s something I can\u2019t get over. I also grew up with him(sort of) so I never found him attractive or anything.\n\nBasically the first dream I had could be explained by me thinking I could like him after one of my friends mentioned he was my type and him being nicer to me at the time, though that could also be due to us just starting to hang out more then. Like a few days after that dream i remembered why I could never like him in a more than friends way. I think this recent dream was caused by one of our mutual friends liking him and talking about it while trying not to make it too obvious. I think it was because she kept saying things like \u201che\u2019s actually so nice, caring, etc.\u201d  anyways I told him about the dream, which I now realize was a mistake, and then we had a longer talk about dating(not each other just the topic) and about the guy I like and the type of people he would date and why. I specifically mentioned the guy I like because I wanted to make it clear to him that I don\u2019t like him. He has known that I\u2019ve liked that guy on and off for the past 4 years, so it\u2019s not a surprise. \n\nAnyway, the reason I think he may think I like him is that he jokingly(?) asked if any protection was used and i then told him there was(that\u2019s literally how I know what happened, like in the first dream he had one for some reason and in the second dream he was going to buy some and I was supposed to look for a hiding place from the others who were there with us). I also then told him that if it made him feel better, I didn\u2019t actually remember us having sex, and I just knew it happened and he said in his sort of usual awkwardly sarcastic(?) tone \u201cjust stop it.\u201d He then went on to ask if I knew about the mutual friend who liked him and I told him I did, which he followed up by saying he had a gut feeling as to her liking him and also what my dream was about but that he wished he was wrong both times, which is what led to the longer deeper conversation we had about dating in general. When I have seen him, things seem normal from an outside perspective, but I think that he thinks I could/do like him. \n\nTL;DR:\nI had two weird dreams months apart about me dating a friend  and I told him about the dreams after I had the second dream a couple of days or weeks ago. Unfortunately, one of our mutual friends had just confessed to him, so we ended up having a longer deeper talk about dating in general, and I mentioned the guy I like to reassure my friend that I don\u2019t have feelings towards him because I like someone already, but I think I messed things up between us by even mentioning the dreams and that he now thinks I like him.

    "selftext": "Hi Reddit, I'm going to do my best to not make this sound like a gum advertisement or a sex novel hahah.  I've recently told this story to a friend who thought it was so funny and said I should write it down somewhere.  So obviously I thought Reddit would be perfect, I'm trying to start posting some of my crazy life stories on here.\n\nSo first I need to give some background about myself and my relationship with gum.  I (M28) have chronic tonsil stones.  For anyone who doesn't know, a tonsil stone is a little white ball that forms if a food particle gets stuck in your tonsils, and they smell like there's a rotten animal in the back of your throat.  I still remember coughing up my first one in elementary school music class and not knowing what it was, but I *still* remember it, and the smell.   Now that I am aware of this issue, I'm very self conscious about my breath and *always* have gum in my mouth.  I even got doctor notes to be able to chew gum where it's not allowed (like the school bus ect).  I've considered getting my tonsils removed but would rather not have a surgery for something that can be fixed with chewing gum.\n\nOver the years, I have become a gum expert.  I know which brands smell the best and last the longest, and have come to discover the best gum for me.  I'm not sponsored, but I will say that my ideal flavor is Spearmint from a brand that has an space related name.  Now I ONLY chew this brand of gum because it lasts pretty long, and I've experienced other gums that either denigrate into almost a wet tissue type texture that has to be spit out immediately, and other brands that break up into tiny pieces after a certain amount of time.\n\nOne last detail is that although I *always* have this gum in my mouth, I don't chew it much, and it's usually just between my molars and cheek.  People have even pointed out that they can't tell I have gum in my mouth because I never actively chew it.  I'm also a gymnast and even do backflips with it in my mouth.\n\nSo now that you all think I'm that girl from Willy Wonka with the chewing gum, here's my fun TIFU story.  About 6 or 7 years ago I was visiting my college town and at the bar.  I sat next to a really handsome guy with a nice smile that I later learned was in the military.  I struck up a convo with him and he was telling me about how he was wearing his hat backwards to attract girls because douchey guys wear their hats backwards and girls like douchebags.  Then he pointed at one of my old college acquaintances walking out with a girl wearing his hat backwards, and said see?  I confirmed I actually knew that guy and he is a douche, he made fun of me for my hobby of insect photography.  Weird conversation but I entertained it because he was hot and maybe I had a chance?  I don't remember what else we spoke about that night, but that always stuck out to me lol.\n\nAt the end of the night he invited me back to his place which I thought was odd, because I thought he was straight.  At first I declined and said I'm staying with a friend less than a block away but he insisted so again I thought maybe I have a chance with this guy.  I shared my location with the friend I was staying with and while we were driving back to his place, he told me about how he was curious so I was like \"so you will cuddle with me tonight???\"  And he said \"probably more ;)\"\n\nWhen we got back to his place he showered since he had been at some sort of military training for a few days, and then came back to the bedroom to hook up.  I asked him if he had gum (of course the one time I left the house without it), partially to clean the taste of White Gummy Bear Drinks from my mouth and partially because I recently heard somewhere that BJs feel better with minty gum and he handed me a brand that was not the Space Gum brand I like.  I immediately recognized that, but beggars can't be choosers right?\n\nNow for the NSFW part.  We started hooking up and without being too vulgar, I made my with my mouth down from his neck to his chest to his beautiful abs to his dick.  After we finished hooking up, he turned the light on, looked in the mirror and said \"DUDE! WHAT THE FUCK!\"\n\nWell apparently it was one of those brands that breaks up into tiny pieces in my mouth, and he had little tiny pieces of gum stuck to his body hair.  He was blonde so he didn't have a lot of body hair, and I think he might have shaven too but it was so embarrassing to help him pick all these little pieces of gum off of him lol.\n\nOther than that, it was a pretty good hook up and we stayed in touch and hooked up again but I'm not in to long distance relationships and he was still more interested in women.\n\nTL;DR I hooked up with a hot guy from the bar and my gum got stuck to his body hair.",

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Reddit, I&amp;#39;m going to do my best to not make this sound like a gum advertisement or a sex novel hahah.  I&amp;#39;ve recently told this story to a friend who thought it was so funny and said I should write it down somewhere.  So obviously I thought Reddit would be perfect, I&amp;#39;m trying to start posting some of my crazy life stories on here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So first I need to give some background about myself and my relationship with gum.  I (M28) have chronic tonsil stones.  For anyone who doesn&amp;#39;t know, a tonsil stone is a little white ball that forms if a food particle gets stuck in your tonsils, and they smell like there&amp;#39;s a rotten animal in the back of your throat.  I still remember coughing up my first one in elementary school music class and not knowing what it was, but I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; remember it, and the smell.   Now that I am aware of this issue, I&amp;#39;m very self conscious about my breath and &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have gum in my mouth.  I even got doctor notes to be able to chew gum where it&amp;#39;s not allowed (like the school bus ect).  I&amp;#39;ve considered getting my tonsils removed but would rather not have a surgery for something that can be fixed with chewing gum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I have become a gum expert.  I know which brands smell the best and last the longest, and have come to discover the best gum for me.  I&amp;#39;m not sponsored, but I will say that my ideal flavor is Spearmint from a brand that has an space related name.  Now I ONLY chew this brand of gum because it lasts pretty long, and I&amp;#39;ve experienced other gums that either denigrate into almost a wet tissue type texture that has to be spit out immediately, and other brands that break up into tiny pieces after a certain amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One last detail is that although I &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have this gum in my mouth, I don&amp;#39;t chew it much, and it&amp;#39;s usually just between my molars and cheek.  People have even pointed out that they can&amp;#39;t tell I have gum in my mouth because I never actively chew it.  I&amp;#39;m also a gymnast and even do backflips with it in my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now that you all think I&amp;#39;m that girl from Willy Wonka with the chewing gum, here&amp;#39;s my fun TIFU story.  About 6 or 7 years ago I was visiting my college town and at the bar.  I sat next to a really handsome guy with a nice smile that I later learned was in the military.  I struck up a convo with him and he was telling me about how he was wearing his hat backwards to attract girls because douchey guys wear their hats backwards and girls like douchebags.  Then he pointed at one of my old college acquaintances walking out with a girl wearing his hat backwards, and said see?  I confirmed I actually knew that guy and he is a douche, he made fun of me for my hobby of insect photography.  Weird conversation but I entertained it because he was hot and maybe I had a chance?  I don&amp;#39;t remember what else we spoke about that night, but that always stuck out to me lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the night he invited me back to his place which I thought was odd, because I thought he was straight.  At first I declined and said I&amp;#39;m staying with a friend less than a block away but he insisted so again I thought maybe I have a chance with this guy.  I shared my location with the friend I was staying with and while we were driving back to his place, he told me about how he was curious so I was like &amp;quot;so you will cuddle with me tonight???&amp;quot;  And he said &amp;quot;probably more ;)&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we got back to his place he showered since he had been at some sort of military training for a few days, and then came back to the bedroom to hook up.  I asked him if he had gum (of course the one time I left the house without it), partially to clean the taste of White Gummy Bear Drinks from my mouth and partially because I recently heard somewhere that BJs feel better with minty gum and he handed me a brand that was not the Space Gum brand I like.  I immediately recognized that, but beggars can&amp;#39;t be choosers right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now for the NSFW part.  We started hooking up and without being too vulgar, I made my with my mouth down from his neck to his chest to his beautiful abs to his dick.  After we finished hooking up, he turned the light on, looked in the mirror and said &amp;quot;DUDE! WHAT THE FUCK!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well apparently it was one of those brands that breaks up into tiny pieces in my mouth, and he had little tiny pieces of gum stuck to his body hair.  He was blonde so he didn&amp;#39;t have a lot of body hair, and I think he might have shaven too but it was so embarrassing to help him pick all these little pieces of gum off of him lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than that, it was a pretty good hook up and we stayed in touch and hooked up again but I&amp;#39;m not in to long distance relationships and he was still more interested in women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I hooked up with a hot guy from the bar and my gum got stuck to his body hair.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "So, I was just recently hired by an HR company to do some IT/Marketing stuff, and I was pretty happy about it at first.\n\nHowever, today I encountered a problem I may have overstepped some boundaries when trying to solve the problem.\n\nThe person at the front desk had some performance as well as hardware issues with their old Windows 7 machine and asked me to solve it. Once near the PC I tried unplugging and plugging the Ethernet cable, which blue-screened the PC. So, I thought to myself \"oh, just reinstall the network driver, easy peasy\". But then, when I uninstalled the driver, I rebooted the machine in order to check if it was completely gone, but by doing that I locked myself out of the PC.\n\nThis lock-thing happened because the account the lady was using was being stored on the server-side, not locally, which meant if I wanted to login to the PC I would need the username and password of the local account, which nobody, not even the IT company hired to do most of the computer stuff knew about. Without option, and since the lady needed the telephony app workig ASAP, I impulsively installed a Linux partition and tried emulating the software on Wine without asking for permission first.\n\nFor anyone knowledgeable about IT and Linux, this isn't much of a problem to fix if they do not desire the Linux OS anymore, but to the lady that was using the PC she probably thought I \"destroyed\" or permanently modified it beyond repair. The Windows 7 is still sitting there but like I said, you can't do jack squat without local admin username and password, and the company hired to do the IT part doesn't know or doesn't want to share this information. It also doesn't help that she has a very deep and intimidating voice. I am still anxious (heart-racing) and afraid of what will happen.\n\nI was hired to do fix anything IT related and I did not want to appear incompetent and now I'm probably more screwed than ever. I really hope they see it the other way, because it would be embarrassing to be fired in just a short time.\n\nTL;DR, I tried using Linux as a workaround tool without permission at work because the PC would not work/logon.",

Pretty standard stuff, and I do enjoy speaking and engaging with just about anyone.\n\nAt some point after lunch, I hit the bathroom, as one does, and washed my hands, as one also does.\n\nI didn't dry my hands too hard since there were no paper towels and no electric blow dryer. So as I'm leaving the bathroom, I bump into this guy that I sort of knew from another company a few years back. As I go to shake his hand I have the crushing realization that my shit is moist af, but at this point, there's no stopping the train, it was genuinely like the Cyclops Ryu dap up in Marvel Vs. Capcom - powerful stuff.\n\nAll I can do is kind of cringe when his dry hand makes contact with my wet one. A minor social faux pas, no biggie. But of course, my idiot brain decides to blurt out - \"sorry my hands are wet, I just peed all over them,\" in a completely deadpan voice.\n\nHe kind of recoiled, said \"uhhhh\", and then shuffled away awkwardly before I could explain anything.\n\nI found out later that he's now working at a company we've been trying to pitch for months so my boss was kind of pissed, but he did chuckle at least (not even sure how he found out).\n\nStill don't know why my brain betrayed me but at least you guys can laugh at me.\n\nTL:DR washed my hands in the bathroom, and told a potential client I peed on them for some reason",

Pretty standard stuff, and I do enjoy speaking and engaging with just about anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point after lunch, I hit the bathroom, as one does, and washed my hands, as one also does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t dry my hands too hard since there were no paper towels and no electric blow dryer. So as I&amp;#39;m leaving the bathroom, I bump into this guy that I sort of knew from another company a few years back. As I go to shake his hand I have the crushing realization that my shit is moist af, but at this point, there&amp;#39;s no stopping the train, it was genuinely like the Cyclops Ryu dap up in Marvel Vs. Capcom - powerful stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I can do is kind of cringe when his dry hand makes contact with my wet one. A minor social faux pas, no biggie. But of course, my idiot brain decides to blurt out - &amp;quot;sorry my hands are wet, I just peed all over them,&amp;quot; in a completely deadpan voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He kind of recoiled, said &amp;quot;uhhhh&amp;quot;, and then shuffled away awkwardly before I could explain anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found out later that he&amp;#39;s now working at a company we&amp;#39;ve been trying to pitch for months so my boss was kind of pissed, but he did chuckle at least (not even sure how he found out).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still don&amp;#39;t know why my brain betrayed me but at least you guys can laugh at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR washed my hands in the bathroom, and told a potential client I peed on them for some reason&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My boyfriend used to live in that flat some years ago while he was at university, so we\u2019ve both spent a lot of time there. The flat is on the second floor with a view of a neighborhood courtyard where a community of stray cats lives. Whenever we used to cook, we would always look out the kitchen window to watch the cats.\n\nCut to midday today: I was making pasta for lunch when my boyfriend looked out the window. The blinds were halfway up, so while I, being 5'1\", could see a teenage girl in a school uniform walking through the courtyard, my 6'2\" boyfriend couldn\u2019t. He did, however, spot an old calico cat sitting right below our window that he recognized. As the girl approached her door, my boyfriend started going \"pspspspspsps\" at the cat.\n\nThe girl started walking faster and turned her back to us when she reached her door, but my boyfriend kept going. I tried to make it clear that we were talking about the stray cat outside, but I\u2019ve completely lost my voice from a cold I caught on the trip. So, from her perspective, what she probably heard was what sounded like a man and a chain-smoking whispering perv going \"pspspspsps\" at her, saying things like, \u201cWow, she\u2019s still here, she\u2019s so beautiful, probably 13 or 14 now.\u201d\n\nI was mortified. I backed away from the window and explained to my boyfriend that the girl probably thought we were talking to her. He said he only noticed her when she got to the door. I went back to the window, hoping to somehow make it clear we were talking about the cat, but my boyfriend didn\u2019t get the hint and I couldn\u2019t speak louder than a whisper, let alone yell out to clarify things to the girl (which would have been awkward anyway).\n\nWe backed away again and I explained the whole situation to my boyfriend\u2014how she sped up, turned her back, and how all she could see from the outside was a dark window and not us. He seemed pretty unconcerned about the fact that we had, quite literally, cat-called a teenager. I feel so embarrassed and guilty because I know what it feels like for this kind of thing to happen. He later apologized to me, but I told him I\u2019m not the one who needs the apology. My boyfriend really is a sweetheart, he's loving and respectful but a bit unaware sometimes. I don't think he gets the how scary it is sometimes to exist as a woman, I just wish I would have reacted faster to avoid the situation. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything we can do now that wouldn\u2019t make the situation even more awkward, but I think I\u2019m going to feel second-hand embarrassment from this forever. \n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend and I accidentally cat-called a girl while trying to pspsps at a stray cat.",

I don&amp;#39;t think he gets the how scary it is sometimes to exist as a woman, I just wish I would have reacted faster to avoid the situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything we can do now that wouldn\u2019t make the situation even more awkward, but I think I\u2019m going to feel second-hand embarrassment from this forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: My boyfriend and I accidentally cat-called a girl while trying to pspsps at a stray cat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

This TIFU happened about four hours ago. \nI'm currently on holiday in Bogota, which is beautiful, and like all tourists decided to head to one of the awesome free art museums. After looking around a couple of rooms, I start to feel a little tired from the walking, so I make a beeline for an empty bench. It's in the middle of the room, nothing around it, so I move closer. On inspection, it's a black bench with 5 shallow bowls on it. I think to myself; cool, they have funky benches here! With little bowl seats for each person on the bench! I move closer and notice that the bowls are balanced slighty on the bench - even better - it's a fun bench you can wobble the seats on! At this point, I reach out to wobble a seat... And then multiple things happen simultaneously. Firstly, the bowl makes a dull clanging thump as I push a side down towards the bench and I realise that it's made of some kind of glass and stone. Before I have the chance to make the connection that this is not normal bench material the screaming starts. As I look in the direction of the noise I realise its the security guard, screaming at me. Surprised, I look to the other group of tourists who are open mouthed looking at me in shock. At this point, I see that those tourists are sat on the other bench in the room - which is made of wood and very bench looking. It hits me that I am pushing on something incredibly expensive and old and important. I immediately let go of the bowl, and start apologising in my basic level Spanish, before almost running out of the door. \n\nI have no idea if I damaged the art and I'm so worried I'm going to end up on twitter/reddit as one of those awful CCTV people who damage art at museums. I am generally a very law abiding person and I am feeling so stressed about this. \n\nTLDR: a bench like piece of modern art in a national museum tricked me, and now i'm worried the colombian authorities are after me.\n\nEdit:\nI found a picture of the artwork online so you can all judge for yourselves how much of an idiot In was:\nhttps://colecciones.banrepcultural.org/document/guatavita-instalacin/63a069015d96b8790f25c066?pageId=6357aa7ae27d753f221c618d&amp;denominacin%5B0%5D=Instalaci%C3%B3n&amp;pos=14&amp;pgn=0",

And now I haven&amp;#39;t the foggiest as to what the surname even was and the email service won&amp;#39;t let me open that one inbox despite the fact that I used the correct password and username, because they suspect it was hacked or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, because it was (initially) just a backup account for forum subscriptions and such, I never bothered binding a phone number, an alternative email or adding any real data like an actual name and date of birth what could be used to prove that the account is truly mine, should I contact the support. Yay me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried searching online for university&amp;#39;s staff members list to help jog my memory, but none of the people with the same first name were a match, no matter which alphabet or spelling I used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR: I used a foreign university professor&amp;#39;s last name as a security question for an email, forgot what it was, and now can&amp;#39;t log in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "This was Sunday. I still feel awful.\n\nTook a cab home to Brooklyn from Newark Airport, solo with my toddler. Late evening, end of a long tough day of traveling with the little one.\n\nCabbie was an incredibly sweet older man. He gave my daughter an apple. He complimented her \u201csinging.\u201d Said \u201cG-d bless her.\u201d Incredibly sweet old man. He mentioned he\u2019d be going home after dropping us off because he\u2019d had open heart surgery (!).\n\nWe live on a busy one-way street. There\u2019s a fire hydrant in front of my building and a loading zone right on the corner of the block. Cabs usually drop off at one or the other. This was the first time since I moved to this building 3+ years ago that both of those spots have been occupied at the same time, and I\u2019m getting in with luggage, a stroller, a very tired toddler in a car seat.\n\nHe pulls in at an odd angle (like the police precinct parking angle) to a non-spot on the other side of the street from my building. There\u2019s a two-way bike lane between the parking on that side and the curb, bike lane gets a lot of e-bike traffic, not great for unloading. \n\nThe fare comes to $143, not including tip. I hadn\u2019t flown into Newark in forever, since back when it was around $100 for a cab back, so I wasn\u2019t fully prepared for the price. \u201cYou can add the tip\u2026 So $200?\u201d he jokes. It was a phone app, not like a card reader with a tip percent to select on it, and I wasn\u2019t expecting to have to enter a total instead of the tip amount. I thought $40 would be a nice, really generous tip to give, since he\u2019d been so kind to us. But my mouth accidentally said, \u201cHow about $193\u2013I mean $183!\u201d He was clearly annoyed and disappointed by the instant downgrade, so he goes, \u201cHow about $190?\u201d I was annoyed because this was already way over budget, but my toddler was already starting to fuss and cry, seeing we were parked on our street and not getting out yet, and it was my own dumb fault for saying the wrong thing then walking it back, so I was like \u201cSure, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nMy card declined in the app twice. I had to go into my bank account and see that my bank had flagged it as fraud and approve the transaction. By the time the payment finally went through, my toddler, who\u2019d been holding it together pretty well up until that point in a long day, was having a full on meltdown, loud screaming, kicking, crying.\n\nI decide that the easiest fastest way to unload, given the circumstances, would be to pick her up in her car seat (which my back really can\u2019t handle) and run her across the street while the light was red (like jaywalk it when there are no cars coming), then set her down and do the same for our stuff. \n\nSo I set down my screaming crying toddler in her car seat on the sidewalk, yell across the street for the driver to please open the trunk. When he opens it, I leave her on the sidewalk, run and grab our bags. The driver brings over the stroller (a gb pockit\u2014not like a huge stroller). I thank him.\n\nThe sidewalk on our side is a wide one. We live next door to a restaurant that has outdoor dining. I pick up the little one in her car seat, run her over to the building, set her down screaming and crying bloody murder in her car seat in front of the door to our building while I run back to grab our stuff to bring it over.\n\nThe screaming and crying has, of course, gotten the attention of the people dining at the restaurant, who are now looking over aghast at my child: it\u2019s nighttime, and the sidewalk is wide enough and the distance to the luggage and the stroller is far enough that they don\u2019t immediately see me / make the connection that I\u2019m with her. Everyone is looking in shock at this crying baby who looks like she\u2019s been abandoned all by herself in front of a building.\n\nI run over to the building, struggling, schlepping all of our stuff. I\u2019m still a bit salty from the cost of the ride being so much higher than I\u2019d budgeted for,  and I\u2019m feeling like I owe the restaurant customers an explanation, so, as I\u2019m hauling our stuff over, I yell over to them, \u201cI tipped the cab driver like $50, and he didn\u2019t even help me!\u201d\n\nI thought he had already driven away. \nHe had not. \nHe was right in front of the restaurant with his car windows down. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if he fully heard me or only partly heard me or if he didn\u2019t hear me but maybe just caught the gist of the situation. But he probably heard me.  I saw his face in that moment, and I felt terrible.\n\nIt, of course, wasn\u2019t his fault that both of the usual unloading spots on my side of the street were taken. It wasn\u2019t his fault that he\u2019d had open heart surgery and probably couldn\u2019t help me carry my things. It wasn\u2019t his fault that my toddler was having a meltdown or that I\u2019d gotten his hopes up by misspeaking about an over-large tip (that was already a lot) or that my card got declined at first.\n\nI feel so terrible. I wish I could find him and apologize or make it up to him.\n\nTL;DR: A super nice old cab driver heard me loudly complaining that he didn\u2019t help me; I feel like shiit.",

    "selftext": "Even though this altercation happened 5 years ago, it still felt like today because it is directly impacting my daily life due to the fact my sis still lives in the same city as me and is adamant in not moving out.\n\nI (23M) was born in Asia, immigrated to the US in 2012,  and studied at an elite private high school for 6 years before attending a T20 university in 2018 where I was later conferred an SB in EECS. I am currently a US Citizen and live in a studio apartment in an affluent neighbourhood of which I pay $1650/month for. I am currently engaged in post graduate research to prepare for my PhD in a few years, and make money as a software consultant, freelance mobile app developer, part-time tech YouTuber, and part-time investor.\n\nI have positive relations with my paternal family (most of his US-bound relatives immigrated to the US with H1B visas and reside in NJ, VA, CA). However, I have ambivalent (mostly negative) relations with my maternal family of which all of her US-bound relatives live in the same state an hour away from me.\n\nDue to the fact my paternal relatives are affluent/influential, and communists, they are being perceived as the 'black sheep' and 'scapegoats' in my mother's family. My maternal relatives also espouse traditionalistic views and are apathetic towards elite institutions. For example, they heavily practise filial piety and hair dye/tattoos are off limits in the family.\n\nMy parents (74M, 63F) still live in Asia and even though both are retired, they were former mid to high ranking dignitaries in Asia and have millions in assets.\n\nDuring high school, my unweighted GPA was very close to 4.0 (my weighted GPA was much higher given the fact I took many AP courses as well as post-AP courses such as Multivariable Calculus/Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Discrete Maths, CS 2, etc) and I received a 1550 on the SAT (800M, 750V) as well as an 800 on two SAT subject tests (Math II, Physics). I even competed in the USAMO and ISEF and had two CS internships in Summer of 2017 and 2018.\n\nEven though I have achieved a lot during my childhood years and adolescence and was contemplating about starting a tech startup, my mother's side showed more affection towards my sister (23F) who dreamt of becoming a general practitioner and went to a university with a &gt;80% acceptance rate (in the same city as me as my parents attended her commencement and I drove my parents there) They gave her more warmth, they talked in a nicer and more friendly tone towards her, and they even praised her, whilst my achievements were mostly ignored and instead, I was castigated during family gatherings and at worse, even ostracised. My older cousins sometimes even engaged in corporal punishment if I didn't socialise with the whole family and I am obviously weak at social skills myself. That made me feel jealous because even though my father and mother helped fund for my schooling, they as well as the whole of the mother's side collectively funded her lifestyle and gave her perks and affection. In fact, in 2014, during 9th grade, my maternal relatives attempted to tell my parents to withhold my tuition money and send me to a worse private school and siphon that money towards her so she could get freebies as well as attend some school like Philips Andover whilst also buying a condo/single house for her due to her 'respecting the family more' and 'knowing how to speak their language'.\n\nWe attended the same high school and we lived with our older sister (34F) in a 2000 sqft house.\n\nIn 2019, things did take a turn for the worse. I was still under 18 in summer of 2019 so I couldn't invest the money nor have a bank account of my own, but needless to say, I bought a safe to stockpile all the money I earned through internships, YouTube revenue, and mobile app revenue at the time, so my bank would typically have amounts in the low thousands for immediate purchases. Needless to say, in July 2019, due to the fact my 34F sister is still in charge of my bank account, I saw that my balance went down from $6000 to $1000. I essentially lost $5000 of my own money and guess what:\n\nAll of the money went to my 23F sister.\n\nIn August, I found out the whole family pooled in money and used my money to buy her a $700k condo in the poshest neighbourhood (even moreso than mine which is a college neighbourhood) and they also bought her a brand new 2019 BMW 330xi as well as pooled in money for her EB5 visa.\n\nDue to this, I became jealous at her. Unfortunately, I didn't have a therapist at the time, so I ended up so infuriated I essentially had a vocal altercation with her on the phone that went a little bit too far that my sister decided that she will go NC against me and 'lost her trust' on me. In retaliation, I went NC with everyone in my family, except my parents because I kinda rely on them for financial support as I just started to make in the mid 5 figures per year on my software. In September 2019, I started my own bank account, sold the safe, and stockpiled my money into the bank, where I funneled in all of it towards investments. By 2021, I sacked them and was 100% self reliant, and frugal (that meant I didn't move to any luxe-apartments nor did I buy any car and instead used a $250 Walmart bike to commute).\n\nEven though everything was harmonious between 2019-20 with me coexisting with her in the same city, things started to go out of control in 2020 that made my undergraduate GPA plummet, from a 4.8 in 2018-19 to a 4.6 in 2020 (remote year), and then to a 4.0 in 2021 (first in person year).\n\nTurns out, even though I have no idea of my sisters whereabouts whether she is in Asia or in the US as it was COVID, turns out police knocked on my apartment door and gave me a warning that my sister reported me to them for \"stalking\" at her college (had no idea where she studied and I was minding my own business and did not go to her college). That was what caused a heated altercation with my relatives. I told my relatives to calm my sister down, apologise for my supposed 'wrongdoing' and asked them to let her know I did nothing wrong and that I was minding my own business.\n\nIn 2020, she travelled to Asia and my parents sold that condo in September 2020, so I had no idea where she lived as my parents own multiple multi-family and single family units throughout the metropolitan area.\n\nThat made me paranoid, wanting to transfer out to another university in another state but feared upon losing my place at a top tier university, and it caused me to have trauma and sleepless nights and disinterest in studying which was what caused my GPA to plummet. It is so fascinating that my mother's family who obviously support her tell me they have nothing to do with her and they can't control her life and they just essentially let her free roam like this, which was what harmed my life. They even gaslit me, making claims that she is 'stubborn', 'a tough girl', etc, and that she won't listen because she came from wealthy family, and spread misinformation that children of impoverished parents are better behaved and more compassionate.\n\nI know my sister very well as we were classmates at high school and she is known to volunteer and help other people out, mentor, and offer therapy/counseling to marginalised/neurodivergent people, even if her grades/SATs weren't as stellar as mine and she took less AP courses than me.\n\nIn 2021, I essentially returned to campus so depressed that I essentially lacked any support as I had no therapists or psychiatrists, and my GPA plummeted big time. Even though I had an internship, a research fellowship, led a campus club, and held awards, etc, during 1st and 2nd year, I was heavily demotivated in the 2021-2 school year and all I wanted to do was graduate. After graduating, I took a small 1 week Europe trip to Berlin, Warsaw, Vienna, Bratislava, and Prague, and went back to just a deep several month rest. I did eventually get hold of a therapist and actually got a relatives RAV4 in the beginning of 2023 whilst they buy a Tesla Model Y for themselves and just driven around the East Coast for some relaxation.\n\nBetween 2019 and mid-2023 when my sister graduated from university and my parents visited US for the first time since COVID, I had no contact with her whatsoever. I didn't have any idea what neighbourhood or town she lived between 2020 and 2023, let alone the house. Now even though May 2023 was the only time since 2019 when I did talk to her, apologising to her for the 2019 incident, establishing boundaries, and ameliorating the relationship, she claimed she is traumatised by my actions, had sleepless nights, and had to resort to therapist. She ended up using profanity in front of me as well.\n\nLater, one of my cousins told me that my sister was featured on the student spotlight on the front page of the school, despite the fact my family gaslighted me telling me she is a low achiever and struggled in college. I also found out on YouTube watching her school graduation that she graduated summa cum laude (3.9/4.0) and held an internship in Healthcare and now is hired full time in that position. I was immensely betrayed. It's so baffling my family let my GPA slide whilst my sister essentially got full support even from extended family and is uplifted. She even benefited off my money and my work. Her school even praised her for being extremely involved in the school and mentions nothing about trauma whatsoever.\n\nAfterwards, I started to use my mobile revenue and investment portfolio to live off it, joined a post-undergrad research fellowship at my university in summer 2023 after returning home from yet another trip in Europe for escapism as well as start Doordashing for some fresh air outside and extra money for petrol/electric as well as to clear my brain, and all went well. Despite that, I might have bumped into her neighbourhood several times as I visited every neighourhood in the city as well as nearby suburbs through Doordash. My sister and family have been campaigning for me to leave the metro area which might result in me losing my network as well as support for my tech startup as my city is one of the top cities for tech in the US.\n\nTL;DR: 5 years ago, there was an incident that caused me (23M) to be estranged from my family and upended my life, and even though I went NC with large swaths of my family, my sister still accused me of 'calling her' despite not knowing her number, and now she and my family are threatening litigation against me, making it hard to ignore. The only thing I wanted to do now is leave this state entirely to totally forget about this family but then I would have to restart my social network from scratch if I were to move to let's say, California.\n\nSis, if you are reading this, I truly apologise for the behaviour I did against you back in 2019. I tried my best to fix my behaviour and visit a therapist. I just felt like I had to vent because of this.",

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though this altercation happened 5 years ago, it still felt like today because it is directly impacting my daily life due to the fact my sis still lives in the same city as me and is adamant in not moving out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I (23M) was born in Asia, immigrated to the US in 2012,  and studied at an elite private high school for 6 years before attending a T20 university in 2018 where I was later conferred an SB in EECS. I am currently a US Citizen and live in a studio apartment in an affluent neighbourhood of which I pay $1650/month for. I am currently engaged in post graduate research to prepare for my PhD in a few years, and make money as a software consultant, freelance mobile app developer, part-time tech YouTuber, and part-time investor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have positive relations with my paternal family (most of his US-bound relatives immigrated to the US with H1B visas and reside in NJ, VA, CA). However, I have ambivalent (mostly negative) relations with my maternal family of which all of her US-bound relatives live in the same state an hour away from me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the fact my paternal relatives are affluent/influential, and communists, they are being perceived as the &amp;#39;black sheep&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;scapegoats&amp;#39; in my mother&amp;#39;s family. My maternal relatives also espouse traditionalistic views and are apathetic towards elite institutions. For example, they heavily practise filial piety and hair dye/tattoos are off limits in the family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents (74M, 63F) still live in Asia and even though both are retired, they were former mid to high ranking dignitaries in Asia and have millions in assets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During high school, my unweighted GPA was very close to 4.0 (my weighted GPA was much higher given the fact I took many AP courses as well as post-AP courses such as Multivariable Calculus/Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Discrete Maths, CS 2, etc) and I received a 1550 on the SAT (800M, 750V) as well as an 800 on two SAT subject tests (Math II, Physics). I even competed in the USAMO and ISEF and had two CS internships in Summer of 2017 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though I have achieved a lot during my childhood years and adolescence and was contemplating about starting a tech startup, my mother&amp;#39;s side showed more affection towards my sister (23F) who dreamt of becoming a general practitioner and went to a university with a &amp;gt;80% acceptance rate (in the same city as me as my parents attended her commencement and I drove my parents there) They gave her more warmth, they talked in a nicer and more friendly tone towards her, and they even praised her, whilst my achievements were mostly ignored and instead, I was castigated during family gatherings and at worse, even ostracised. My older cousins sometimes even engaged in corporal punishment if I didn&amp;#39;t socialise with the whole family and I am obviously weak at social skills myself. That made me feel jealous because even though my father and mother helped fund for my schooling, they as well as the whole of the mother&amp;#39;s side collectively funded her lifestyle and gave her perks and affection. In fact, in 2014, during 9th grade, my maternal relatives attempted to tell my parents to withhold my tuition money and send me to a worse private school and siphon that money towards her so she could get freebies as well as attend some school like Philips Andover whilst also buying a condo/single house for her due to her &amp;#39;respecting the family more&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;knowing how to speak their language&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We attended the same high school and we lived with our older sister (34F) in a 2000 sqft house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2019, things did take a turn for the worse. I was still under 18 in summer of 2019 so I couldn&amp;#39;t invest the money nor have a bank account of my own, but needless to say, I bought a safe to stockpile all the money I earned through internships, YouTube revenue, and mobile app revenue at the time, so my bank would typically have amounts in the low thousands for immediate purchases. Needless to say, in July 2019, due to the fact my 34F sister is still in charge of my bank account, I saw that my balance went down from $6000 to $1000. I essentially lost $5000 of my own money and guess what:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the money went to my 23F sister.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In August, I found out the whole family pooled in money and used my money to buy her a $700k condo in the poshest neighbourhood (even moreso than mine which is a college neighbourhood) and they also bought her a brand new 2019 BMW 330xi as well as pooled in money for her EB5 visa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to this, I became jealous at her. Unfortunately, I didn&amp;#39;t have a therapist at the time, so I ended up so infuriated I essentially had a vocal altercation with her on the phone that went a little bit too far that my sister decided that she will go NC against me and &amp;#39;lost her trust&amp;#39; on me. In retaliation, I went NC with everyone in my family, except my parents because I kinda rely on them for financial support as I just started to make in the mid 5 figures per year on my software. In September 2019, I started my own bank account, sold the safe, and stockpiled my money into the bank, where I funneled in all of it towards investments. By 2021, I sacked them and was 100% self reliant, and frugal (that meant I didn&amp;#39;t move to any luxe-apartments nor did I buy any car and instead used a $250 Walmart bike to commute).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though everything was harmonious between 2019-20 with me coexisting with her in the same city, things started to go out of control in 2020 that made my undergraduate GPA plummet, from a 4.8 in 2018-19 to a 4.6 in 2020 (remote year), and then to a 4.0 in 2021 (first in person year).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out, even though I have no idea of my sisters whereabouts whether she is in Asia or in the US as it was COVID, turns out police knocked on my apartment door and gave me a warning that my sister reported me to them for &amp;quot;stalking&amp;quot; at her college (had no idea where she studied and I was minding my own business and did not go to her college).

A butchery &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t find the anything else from her&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to inspect the enclosure and I can&amp;#39;t figure out how she managed to escape, everything is locked up and still cat proof except for a part of the wood that has been chewed but this part couldn&amp;#39;t be chewed from the inside of the enclosure which still raise the question. How did she got out&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel very guilty, I feel stupid for trying to keep such incompatible animals together and I hate myself for that&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do, I should rehome my remaining gerbil for sure but I don&amp;#39;t know how I&amp;#39;d live with the guilt of being responsible for such a small creature and I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;d ever forgive my cat. I know it&amp;#39;s not her fault, she&amp;#39;s a kitty designed to hunt and I didn&amp;#39;t scream at her or showed her sign I was mad but deep down I don&amp;#39;t feel like being lovely to her right now, I&amp;#39;m mourning my little Coco&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RIP my Coco, I hope that you didn&amp;#39;t suffer as much as I&amp;#39;d imagine, and I hope I was able to give you the best life possible while you were with me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR; I&amp;#39;ve adopted a cat and gerbils and my cat killed one of my my gerbil &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Every day, it\u2019s the same questions: \u201cHow\u2019s your grade in \\_\\_\\_\\_\u2019s class? Are you keeping up with your assignments?\u201d And the honest answer was... no, I wasn\u2019t. I was falling behind, and I knew that if my dad found out, it would be the end of the world (or at least it felt that way).\n\nCue the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever had. Instead of being honest and dealing with it like a normal human being, I decided to create a fake email account pretending to be my teacher. I thought I could buy myself some time, maybe come up with a plan to fix my grades while my dad was temporarily satisfied. I even used their picture from the school website and wrote emails in the same formal tone they use.\n\nThe first email was pretty innocent, just something about how grades were still being processed and that I was working hard to improve. And\u2026 It worked. My dad completely bought it. He was all, \u201cThanks for the update,\u201d and for a while, I felt like I\u2019d gotten away with it. Every few days, I\u2019d send another email, making excuses for why my grades weren\u2019t posted yet, but assuring him that I was on track.\n\nEverything seemed fine. I was in the clear. Or so I thought.\n\nA few weeks later, my dad started getting more concerned. He didn\u2019t like how vague the emails were getting (I guess I was running out of excuses). So, like any reasonable parent would do, he decided to reach out to the teacher to set up a meeting. Yeah\u2026 this is where it all went to shit.\n\nObviously, when he didn\u2019t get a response from the\u00a0*real*\u00a0teacher, he got suspicious. So, naturally, he contacted the school administration to make sure she was getting his messages. That\u2019s when the school\u2019s IT department got involved. It didn\u2019t take them long to figure out that the \u201cTeacher\u201d email was fake, and it all blew up in my face.\n\nI got a call from the school principal and they laid it all out, how I had impersonated my teacher, how I had been sending fraudulent emails, and how it was a serious breach of trust and school policy. They even mentioned that this could fall under\u00a0*legal*\u00a0implications because I used their name and likeness.\n\nI knew I\u2019d fucked up. Badly. What had started as a desperate attempt to avoid one problem had spiraled into a much larger one. And now, the consequences feel unavoidable. I thought I was being clever, but now it\u2019s all blown up in my face. I\u2019ve let my dad down, made things infinitely worse for myself, and every time I think about how stupid this was, I feel sick to my stomach. I thought I could dodge one problem, and instead, I\u2019ve created a massive one that might haunt me for years.\n\nI wasn\u2019t just facing academic punishment anymore. I was facing the reality that this impulsive decision, this stupid, short-sighted idea could follow me for the rest of my life.\n\nTL;DR: Faked emails pretending to be my teacher to avoid my dad finding out about overdue assignments, he contacted the school, and now I\u2019m potentially facing legal trouble and kind of fucked.",

It turns out the tofu had absorbed more than just the water. It also soaked up the flavor of the tea. Combined with its own flavor, it created something terrible.

    "selftext": "So I am 16m in Highschool and have a group of friends who have been slowly breaking apart due to a random rumor that\u2019s been going around. Someone basically saying that we are racist which none of us are. It\u2019s caused insane amounts of tension and fights that have needed to be de escalated. I\u2019m basically the only thing keeping our group together since I really don\u2019t wanna see this group go away. Best way of doing this to my knowledge was taking the blunt end of it. I\u2019m basically the only person in the group that\u2019s getting into any kind of fights or arguments over this. I only did this because ik out of those in my group I was probably the most patient or non confrontational person if a fight happened. Anyways this has caused my anxiety to be through the roof. This has also made me have way to much pent up anger that I\u2019ve just kinda kept away cuz that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done for around 4 years to try and not show anger issues. Sorry back to topic. So it\u2019s Friday we\u2019re at the game I\u2019m beyond mad at everything but hiding it and being happy. My gf was getting mad at me at the time which made my mental situation worse and I was just trying to wait for the event to be over. I felt like if anybody tried anything I would have just broke. Basically felt helpless. While we were sitting I had to leave due to an asthma attack starting up and I just needed my inhaler rl quick and try and subside it. I came back to a extremely good female friend of mine 16f messing around with my\nPhone and just going through it. She is also in this group and atm my gf and her are insanely annoyed at each other. She is a big reason my gf was mad but it wasn\u2019t her fault so I never blamed her. Anyways I asked for my phone back cuz I was already dealing with my gf and I didn\u2019t need her seeing that plus if my gf saw she had my\nPhone me and my friend would have been in deep\nShit. I asked for it a couple times and then tried to take it out of her hands. She wasn\u2019t go and without thinking I got mad or annoyed and twisted her hand to basically force her to let it go. I could tell once I looked at her I messed up. I let anger get the best of me and genuinely hurt her. I\u2019ve said sorry and apologized multiple times but idk what to do. I don\u2019t wanna try talking to her in case I\u2019m pushing my boundaries. I was just past my breaking point and couldn\u2019t think properly but that\u2019s no excuse and I know that. I\u2019ve spent 5-6 years getting rid of my anger issues through suppression and patience and it\u2019s always worked till now. I\u2019ve always been good to ppl patient, empathetic literally everything to try and be likable and I fuck up by letting someone take my phone get to me. I just don\u2019t know what to do. I had 3 weeks of me accepting fights without doing anything back, listening to people talk shit, listening to people bet others to jump\nMe and listening to my gf complain how somebody ran into her after I got done with a guy trying to throw a punch at me. \n\nIg there\u2019s my story if anything advice would be helpful.\n\nTL;DR : I let pent up anger and depression cause me to hurt a friend of mine over her taking my\nPhone.

You already know where this is going.\n\nThe noodles were *spicy* \u2014like, I\u2019m-sweating-from-my-soul spicy\u2014 but that didn\u2019t stop me. After finishing, I thought I was being smart, so I went and washed my hands, and rinsed my mouth. You know, trying to make sure everything was all good before the main event.\n\nFast forward to the action. We\u2019re getting into it, things are heating up (pun intended), and I decide to go down on her. Big. Mistake. About halfway through, she starts squirming more than usual, and not in a good way. I don\u2019t realize at first that it\u2019s because my lips are basically made of molten lava at this point. I guess the spice hadn\u2019t worn off. :p\n\nShe\u2019s a trooper, though, and we push through\u2014both of us feeling more than just the regular heat. After we finish, I\u2019m feeling proud but confused as to why she\u2019s in so much discomfort. Then it hits me: spicy noodles. Yep, I\u2019d accidentally turned what should have been a good time into a mini fire drill.\n\nWe rush to the shower, hoping some water would cool things off. Nope, not much relief. We ended up laughing about it later, but yeah, it was way more \"spicy\" than either of us wanted.\n\nTL;DR: Ate spicy noodles, thought washing my hands and rinsing my mouth was enough, ended up causing a fire where there definitely shouldn\u2019t be one.",

You already know where this is going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The noodles were &lt;em&gt;spicy&lt;/em&gt; \u2014like, I\u2019m-sweating-from-my-soul spicy\u2014 but that didn\u2019t stop me. After finishing, I thought I was being smart, so I went and washed my hands, and rinsed my mouth. You know, trying to make sure everything was all good before the main event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the action. We\u2019re getting into it, things are heating up (pun intended), and I decide to go down on her. Big. Mistake. About halfway through, she starts squirming more than usual, and not in a good way. I don\u2019t realize at first that it\u2019s because my lips are basically made of molten lava at this point. I guess the spice hadn\u2019t worn off. :p&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She\u2019s a trooper, though, and we push through\u2014both of us feeling more than just the regular heat. After we finish, I\u2019m feeling proud but confused as to why she\u2019s in so much discomfort. Then it hits me: spicy noodles. Yep, I\u2019d accidentally turned what should have been a good time into a mini fire drill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We rush to the shower, hoping some water would cool things off. Nope, not much relief. We ended up laughing about it later, but yeah, it was way more &amp;quot;spicy&amp;quot; than either of us wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Ate spicy noodles, thought washing my hands and rinsing my mouth was enough, ended up causing a fire where there definitely shouldn\u2019t be one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Had to have the FU explained to me.\n\nI, 30M, am socially awkward loner that started using dating apps a while ago. I went in having heard horror stories about men not getting matches, so that was the mindset I had. If I got matches, then great; I'd do my best to date them if I thought we were a good fit. But I wasn't expecting much of anything, and that mindset turned out to bite me later.\n\nI've gotten a handful of matches over time, but most conversations just died after a few messages. At the time I just always attributed it to women having enough options that I just wasn't interesting.\n\nThen came the match I really screwed up on. I matched with a girl in May and we started talking. When talking with someone I generally start with small talk and then escalate to being more flirty if they're interesting. That's what I did here, but this girl took a long time to reply each time (average of 3 days), so it was slow going and I was getting more than a little annoyed after a month had passed and not much had happened. So I decided I was just going to ask her out to do something. I was expecting a yes or no, but instead she expressed confusion that I'd ask her. I just threw up my hands and moved on after that.\n\nAt the time I didn't think anything of it, but when I was talking to another guy later (he wanted to complain about his lack of success and I stupidly didn't shut him down immediately), this story came up. I showed him the chat and the dude basically called me an idiot because he pointed out that at the beginning she responded within a day, and only got less and less frequent after my fourth response when she'd responded with a location she liked to hike and I chose to follow-up about a spot I liked. He said I should've followed up on her answer, then asked her out to that spot, especially since she'd flirted twice by that point and I'd ignored it. Since I didn't ask she took it as a sign of little interest, which is why she was confused when I tried later.\n\nThe real kicker was when he pointed out she could've ghosted or blocked me anytime, and the fact she didn't proved there was still some interest on her end. Then he called me an asshole for stringing her along for a month and said I did her a favor when I quit talking to her.\n\nI felt terrible after that, because what the dude said makes sense. I got so annoyed I never asked myself why she would still be talking to me after a month when most people just immediately ghost if they don't click. It was never my intention to be an asshole, but what's done is done. I'm still matched with her and could technically send her an apology, but I doubt she'd take it as sincere at this point so I don't think it would be worth it when I've already moved on.",

    "selftext": "So Murphy's Law states that \"anything that can go wrong, will go wrong, and at the worst possible time.\"\n\nLittle story:\n\nI lost my wallet 3 weeks ago. I started school around this time, and I needed the train card inside it for traveling, the bank card for buying things, and my ID card was in it, which is just generally a good thing to have on you.\n\nI have an extra spare set of keys at a relative's place because I'm prone to losing things like crazy, but for some reason thought \"I'll just somehow never lose my wallet.\" And I didn't for years! Until now.\n\nThere were about 150\\~ ish euros in that wallet, too, so I was already very upset at myself for losing it. (I know it's not a good idea to keep that much in your wallet; I kept procrastinating on \"putting it away\", thinking I might \"need it later anyway\".)\n\nI searched literally everywhere for 3 days, but found nothing. Assumed it somehow fell out while I was walking down the street... Whoever has it, hope you enjoyed the money, ibuprofen, and Ritalin I had in it...\n\nEventually I have to bite the bullet and I start replacing the cards. But you have to pay to get the train and ID back, so the bank card comes first.\n\nIn the first week, I block my bank account, and try to replace the card. But I have to get to school in this week, too. I have to rely on someone else to buy me e-tickets in advance while I sort this out and I end up paying them back in cash, must've lost around 70ish doing this.\n\nMy school demands I buy books and licenses to material. I tell them I can't, cause I don't have my bank card yet. I pay for things in the shops I pass with coins, like I'm playing Skyrim.\n\nFinally I get my new bank card after 3 - 4 days of waiting. But because of my own stupidity, I didn't use it for another 3 - 4 days because I assumed there would be a new PIN with it, and I couldn't for the life of me find it, and I heavily procrastinated on calling the bank to ask what's up with that (social anxiety!!). Eventually, someone else informed me that the PIN should stay the same.\n\nI try to buy the school material, but don't know where to find them on the websites. I wait until I get to class again so I can ask the teacher. The teacher shows me, but on that day itself I forget to bring my bank card. I have to wait a week before I see this teacher in this class again so she can guide me through...\n\nI forget my laptop charger this same week on another day, rendering me completely useless for 6 hours out of an 8 hour school day.\n\nIn the meantime, I try to replace my train card. But I need to have a professional picture taken for the train card. No problem, I had some taken recently!\n\nOh wait. I left them in my wallet... because of course.\n\nI go get new professional pictures taken, have to pay for that too, and get my train card sorted in a couple of days.\n\nOne last card to replace; my ID card, and then I'm back on track!\n\nI make an appointment to go there. I forget about it completely and sleep through it. Of course...\n\nOn another fun little side note, I had slept through my alarm on a random Monday as well, missing most of the day. And on another Tuesday due to inability to sleep due to relationship problems. Missed the bus and the train about 3 - 5 times by this time as well and showed up late.\n\nI make a new appointment next week, and show up on time, woo! And then as I go to pay for my new ID card, my bank account somehow has insufficient funds and I still don't have it replaced. Should have checked before I left... I could've taken some cash with me.\n\nIn the meantime that this is happening, my teacher has given me a USB drive to take home with me for homework reasons, saying \"it belongs to school, so please bring it back next week\". And guess what I somehow lost? I paid for a new one, unable to find it...\n\nAnd then today has to be the real kicker. I'm making triple sure I have everything for school tomorrow. And then...\n\nI can't find my newly replaced cards.\n\nPanic, stress, searching everywhere... Nearly mentally breaking down.\n\nSuddenly remember I might've accidentally put them in one of my boxes for misc stuff.\n\nI found them. Thank God I did. But if I didn't: I was ready to stop participating in society all together, because wow, I am not wired for this world.\n\nI know it's technically my own fault, or my ADHD's fault... but I can't help but relate with the Murphy's Law statement; like *of course this happens to me.*\n\nMy friends and I used to call it \"u/ChemicalPatientZero's Luck\" before we knew what Murphy's Law was, but it had the exact same principle, if something was to go wrong, it would happen to me.\n\nFeel free to share similar stories...\n\nTL;DR. Lost my wallet with 150 euros, prescription meds, personal photo's, identification, in the week before it was back to school time, spent another 70 on public transport trying to get to school. Forgot to bring my bank card to school the day I needed it. Lost a USB drive that my teacher gave me and told me not to lose. Forgot to bring my laptop charger to school wasting a day. Slept through an appointment and messed up on the second time while trying to replace my ID card. Overslept or was otherwise late to school several times as well. And this was only the first month of school...",

Lost my wallet with 150 euros, prescription meds, personal photo&amp;#39;s, identification, in the week before it was back to school time, spent another 70 on public transport trying to get to school. Forgot to bring my bank card to school the day I needed it. Lost a USB drive that my teacher gave me and told me not to lose. Forgot to bring my laptop charger to school wasting a day. Slept through an appointment and messed up on the second time while trying to replace my ID card. Overslept or was otherwise late to school several times as well. And this was only the first month of school...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "So, a month ago I've found this guy, R, who was organizing a Discord server to play rpgs weekly. Cool dude, was tired of running complex games and prefered to be more laid back, using premade adventures and not worrying much on creating a cohesive world. I respect that, world building can be fun but it's a lot o work and can lead to gm burnout.\n\nWe played for that month and had a blast. Even though he ran premade adventures, he would be very flexible and indulge whatever we came up with, as long as it made sense and we didn't push it past his final judgement. The game can be brutal, and we had a couple of newbies, so I took upon myself that I wouldn't let them die. I began to play more tactical, asking questions and digging for details on everything that could be dangerous or exploited for our benefits. This was awesome for me, and the other players complemented me for being a \"good player\". I was really excited about this game, y'all. It had been the best experience I've had playing TTRPGs so far.\n\nOk, we had played 3 adventures, one about a minotaur, one about a haunted well and we were halfway through the third dungeon when I made a post on Reddit about how dungeons, in concept, didn't make sense. Since I've been pondering about every detail, I've started noticing that, who would have guessed, make believe does not make sense. That minotaur was supposed to be starving like the rest of the maze's denizens. The post was snarky and off-hand, but it was for a bunch of nerds on Reddit, snarky is the secret sauce.\n\nThen down came the comments like pouring rain. I sat in my room, reddit on mobile browser, legs swinging all careless, replying strangers and defending my point that when something doesn't make sense, it undermines player agency and makes the game less fun. Only in the next day I've noticed R had kicked me out of the game group and blocked me in Discord. I checked reddit and lo and behold, he had sent me some private messages at the time i was replying comments. I had even replied to him something along the lines of \"i guess we disagree on our playstyles\" not recognizing his username. I tried explaining to him I wasn't complaining about him or how he runs his game, and that I had had so much fun playing with him I didn't understand we he had cut me off like that, but the (critical) damage has already been done.\n\nSo now I'm a game orphan and I lost the best game mates I've ever had :/ R, if you read this, I'm truly sorry.\n\nTL;DR: I was kicked out of the best ttrpg game I've ever played because I unknowingly insulted the game master with a snarky reddit post.",

    "selftext": "I'm a lonely, nearly 40 year old divorced man and for the last nine months or so I've been scratching both my social and sexual itches by seeing various escorts every two weeks or so. It was going fine, I enjoyed chatting with the ladies I was meeting, then progressing to generally enjoyable sex. \n\nA few months ago I met a new lady who I hit it off with. We had a massively similar range of other interests (and for clarity, this wasn't her just pretending to be interested in the same things, as these were things she volunteered first), similar sense of humour, and the sex was pretty damn good. I decided to keep seeing her regularly, but soon realised I was developing the feels. I decided to ask her on a date, making it clear it would be a personal engagement rather than a professional one, which she politely declined (which was fine, it was what I was expecting). We continued seeing each other on a semi-regular basis. A month or two later, I decided I was starting to have difficulty separating my feelings from our time together, so I decided it was time to move on before things got any worse. I met her for a final time, explaining to her why I could no longer see her as a client. \n\nThis is where things got weird. I expected her, based on our previous interactions, to understand this. Instead, she unexpectedly became quite emotional and said she didn't want to stop seeing me. After more discussion, she asked for my phone and promptly entered her proper name and personal phone number into it. This, I know, is basically breaking rule #1 for escorts, which is never reveal your personal details because of the issues over safety. She wanted me to get back in touch with her about a week afterwards, as she was aware I had care of my children for a period of time, and to organise an actual date with her. \n\nToday was the end of my time with my kids, so I sent her a message asking her when she was available to meet up. She responded saying her boss had found out that she had given me her personal contact info and was mad at her because he believed in doing so she had lost me as a client (she had already effectively lost me as a client before she did this, as I had made it clear we wouldn't be meeting professionally anymore). She asked if we could delay meeting up and if I would come back to her as a client, which would get the heat from the boss off her, with the intent that once things had cooled down we could see each other without him knowing. \n\nThe cynic in me says that there was never any intention to go out, and that this was all just a desire to keep me as a client. But what confuses that for me is her giving me her personal details. Having been a client of this industry for some time now, I know how seriously these ladies guard their personal details, and handing them over for the sake of trying to retain one semi-regular client seems unlikely. I know also there is the possibility that her boss is coercing her to try and do this, eg threatening to stop her working as an escort. \n\nThe unfortunate end to the story is despite having convinced myself that there might actually be a genuine connection between us, one that could develop into something more, I've had to made the decision to just walk away. It's left me feeling both depressed at my hopes of finally having met someone being dashed, stupid for tricking myself into believing it in the first place, and angry that if this was a genuine connection, the circumstances of our meeting basically ruined any chances. \n\nTL:DR: I managed to convince myself that there was a chance of a genuine relationship with an escort who I had been seeing for a few months, only to be disabused of that delusion today and now I'm depressed and venting at my own stupidity.

This is something I\u2019ve done a few times but today I went later than normal since I took my parents out to a movie and made the decision last minute since the start of the sunset was gorgeous \n\nI drove 45 minutes out on some backroads until I arrived. This spot is a scenic overlook of the Appalachian mountains and a popular tourist spot but since it was late nobody was there. I was worried about being out at dusk and since I did not have pepper spray or a knife but still wanted to see the sunset I grabbed a bottle of perfume and left my car unlocked \n\nThe overlook was about 800-1,000ft from my car and you had to walk along a small winding path to reach it. I made it and nothing was out of the ordinary from the dozens of times I\u2019ve been there over the years so I started taking pictures before deciding to take a random video even though it was getting dark \n\nDuring this video I heard some slightly far off barking and the second I heard it and started questioning what it was I heard a barking and howl directly underneath the overlook (the overlook was a small circle porch, anything can get onto it within a matter of seconds). I very quickly realized that I had already been there a good bit between the walk to the overlook and taking the pictures so they likely already knew I was there and had been sneaking up on me. I did not stick around to see them or find out if they really were coyotes\n\nAt this point it was completely dark and I was not about to risk the time to turn on a flashlight so I just booked it as best I could to my car and got out of there as quickly as I possibly could. No the perfume was not used I was worried that was gonna fck me over more than I already was\n\nTL;DR, I chose to go to a mountain to watch the sunset right at dusk but got hunted by coyotes instead ",

    "selftext": "My sister-in-law teaches at the University of Minnesota. She teaches a few of the students and got tickets to a Gopher football game against USC, among other game-related festivities throughout the weekend. She and a guest were invited to go. She would have taken my brother (her husband), but he recently had a flare-up of tinnitus that he's been struggling with, and so he didn't want to go to this very loud event. He suggested to his wife that she take me with them instead, and I happily obliged.\n\nI should specify, although I did go to all of the Gopher football games when I was a student back in the 2000s, I have not kept up with the team at all since I graduated. I don't give a huge damn about how they do, to be honest. I have really not cared about college sports since finishing college 17 years ago. Gopher football is generally not a very good team and is never expected to win big, though they have randomly been pulling off some big wins here and there lately.\n\nAnyway, my sister-in-law is NOT a sports person *at all* and talked repeatedly about how little of a damn she generally gives about any of this. I've known her for nearly 20 years now and I know she has not ever cared about sports and will never care about them in the future. I do know she's frequently stressed out, especially lately, and I know she went to a hot yoga class which wore her out this morning. She and my brother have two young kids at home, and she's a very good mother who takes great care of them and who prioritizes them above all else. She also flat-out said to me that she wouldn't be mad if we left the game a bit early. As for myself, I just ran in a 10K this morning, and I had to get up at 5:30 AM for it, so I was fine with leaving early also. This game did not start until 6:45 PM in the evening.\n\nLong story short, eventually the game reaches the 4th quarter and the Gopher's offense sputters once again, which it has been doing all second half. USC (who, by the way, is ranked 11th in the country) is up by 7 points and gets the ball back, and at that point I decide it's best to give both my sister-and-law and myself what we really want, which is an early exit from this game so we can both go home and get some rest, WITHOUT having to fight traffic. We leave the game.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, as soon as we leave, Minnesota intercepts the ball, then scores a touchdown, tying the game. They would eventually score yet another touchdown and then intercept the ball with less than a minute left in the game, solidifying their improbable victory. Fans stormed the field in excitement, as this 2-3 and unfavored Gopher football team knocked off one of the best teams in the country.\n\nAs we were driving home, her husband was texting her back, saying he was \"appalled\" and \"disappointed\" that we left the game (she read his texts back to me), and she said something to the effect of \"well \\*I\\* didn't want to leave the game...\" She did agree to leave when I suggested it, in my defense. After I dropped her off, she texted me saying \"they're storming the field!\" I have a strong sense that now she's actually pissed that we left. And I am definitely pissed at myself for missing it. I kinda just want to curl up into a ball and die right now.\n\nTL;DR: got tickets to a gopher football game, sister-in-law talked a lot about being tired and how she didn't really want to stick around for the whole game. I obliged and we missed a field-storming victory and I think now SIL is pretty pissed at me also.",

As I've been re-potty training, I now understand why it takes people forever to go to the bathroom.\n\nAlso, just saying, I can't believe this. Why didn't I learn this in school or from my doctor? I told my mom (she potty trained me at age 2), and she didn't know this either!! I'm annoyed, but I'm glad I discovered it before I destroyed my body.\n\nTL;DR: I just learned that you're not supposed to push when you go #1 or #2 and I'm a grown ass adult who's been pushing for years.

Sorry I wasn't clear, I just kinda typed this out pretty quickly and didn't really explain my whole learning experience in full detail.

I started therapy a couple of months ago, though it was a temporary service for the summer since I didn\u2019t have access to one at school. Today I had two meetings, 1 with my former therapist and it was just a recap of the previous sessions, another evaluation to see where I stand now, and wrapping things up. That was during school, but I had another meeting at 3:00 so I got picked up early from school and from 3:00-4:30 ish I had a meeting with the new agency to connect with another therapist now that my other therapy sessions have ended. This one will be a permanent therapist unlike the previous one. I was texting my friend and she asked me to do her a favor and so I did her the favor and then I told her I would be honest with her. I was referring to finally entrusting her with my secret, so I did the favor, sent her screenshots and then shared my notes with her, it was a suicide note I wrote about a month ago, I then went to the restroom and while I was there I got the call notification on my watch. She called me twice and she probably would have called me a third time or however many times until I picked up, I was lucky on my way out when she called the second time. I answered and I could tell she was tearing up. She thought I was about to do something and I thought she could see that it was an old note. I also didn\u2019t give her a warning on it so my bad, but I went back and reread it and apparently I wrote it on a weekend and it\u2019s Friday today, so I get why she thought I was about to or had done something. I cleared things up, but yeah I almost accidentally gave my best friend a heart attack. We continued to talk until I had to leave for my Catholic school classes, and then I had to go to mass, but we started texting again when I got home.\n\nTL;DR:\nTIFU by sending my best friend a su!c!de letter I wrote a month ago without warning about the contents and going to the bathroom right after sending it. While I was in the bathroom she called and I didn\u2019t answer, so I nearly accidentally gave her a heart attack, I answered the call the second time she called me and we cleared things up, though she scolded me which I totally deserved. \n\nExtra Info:\nI told sent the note because I talked about it with the person who interviewed me to set me up with a therapist and because it was within the last 30 days I had to form a safety contract which included setting up 3 emergency contacts. The suicidal episode that made me write the note was a one time thing, I\u2019ve had suicidal tendencies in the past but this was the first suicidal thought I\u2019ve had in a nearly 2 years. Also I have the national suicide prevention hotline number, my school puts all the hotline numbers on the school ID\u2019s \n",

But we butt heads all the time because we often both want to be right and are desperate to be understood and do not put much effort into being understanding. This obviously means our arguments do not go toooo smoothly, but we know this and we\u2019re trying to work on it.\n\nHe is very strait laced, doesn\u2019t drink, smoke, go to clubs or bars. I am not like super wild, but I enjoy going out from time to time and love to get tipsy with my friends and have a nice smoke sesh from time to time. \n\nWhen we first started dating, he hated that I smoked. Even suggested he would end things with me if I continued to. So I decided to stop smoking because it wasn\u2019t super important to me, and it obviously was for him and I just didn\u2019t want to lose him and wanted to avoid the conflict.\n\nSince then, we\u2019ve talked about it more where I\u2019ve expressed I only stopped bc he said he\u2019d end things, and I don\u2019t want to stop doing something I enjoy just because he has a negative perception of it. \n\nAt this point, I was thinking that he had never been around it fr. Just grew up in a strict household in a strict place. Where for me, recreational weed use is literally the norm.\n\nHe asked me if I had smoked since our last conversation about it (where he said I could do it if I wanted, and just not to tell him), and I had so I told him yes. And he responded, he felt very disappointed in me. Obviously- I hated being told that. Like I am an adult.. I didn\u2019t lie to him, I didn\u2019t betray him. If I want to smoke weed once in a while, I should be able to do that without fearing my boyfriend is going to get mad at me for it.\n\nBut he finally dropped all of the lore, as to why he hates weed. He went through some family trauma with someone that was addicted to it and took advantage of his family when he was young, causing much harm.\n\nWhen he told me this, I was still caught up in being told what I did was disappointing and kept asking him to just have an open mind about changing his perception, so that it didn\u2019t hold so much power and didn\u2019t have to be an issue between us.\n\nObviously, I missed a very big moment where he was telling me something he hadn\u2019t told anyone and had a very emotional effect on him. I wish I had just put my own feelings aside and been there for him. I know I made him feel so invalidated and disregarded, which breaks my heart.\n\nObviously I know that my experience and relationship with weed is not at all connected to that family member, but he cannot separate the two which I understand. I literally very rarely smoke, maybe once every three months, and always socially. Even without knowing this, I of course would never have it around him. But I just hated that I wasn\u2019t doing something I enjoyed just because he had discomfort with it, when it wasn\u2019t something around him at all.\n\nNow I know more, I know how deep of a thing this is for him. And I want to be there for him. I know how men feel about never sharing their feelings and when they do, how receiving a poor response can do serious harm. So I don\u2019t know what I can do to fix how I responded to him being vulnerable with me and sharing that info when I was so caught up in my own feelings. \n\nI\u2019m F, we\u2019re both in our early/mid 20s\n\nTL;DR: Missed a very important time my bf opened up to me because I was caught up in my own feelings of being offended by him. He doesn\u2019t want me to smoke weed, and he let me know the traumatic reason behind why. And I didn\u2019t acknowledge it at all. ",

    "selftext": "I am definitely going to delete this later, I'm posting this under my anon account for a reason. I'm just hoping that maybe there are some other people here who've done something similar or nurses that can tell me worse stories from their work to make me feel better about myself. Or at least maybe a little mockery will help turn this from a humiliating story to a funny one.\n\nToday I had an egg retrieval operation in the hospital as part of an egg donation. This is a surgical procedure in which a needle is inserted into the vaginal wall to the ovary, collecting mature eggs to be fertilized. (While normally you only have one, injections are administered for about two weeks beforehand to increase the number of eggs matured in one cycle-- in my case there were about 25 eggs). The retrieval is done under anaesthetic, which I'm going to blame for all my poor decisions.\n\nEverything was going swimmingly until I woke up. For about ten minutes I was totally fine. Then I felt like absolute shit. I've done this once before but it didn't hurt this bad. It felt like period pain, if you were having twenty-five particularly bad periods all at once. The cramps were so bad one of the first things I did once it hit was roll over and throw up (though that could have actually been the nausea from the anaesthetic-- I am not sure).\n\nThere was an IV in my left arm so I didn't want to curl up on my left on top of it, and I tried to curl up on my right but that left my left arm in very uncomfortable position too, so I opted to roll into the fetal position while lying on my back-- that is, with my knees lifted in the air up against my chest and my calves and feet hovering parallel to the bed. This did help with the pain a little. What I realised later when recreating this position at home later is it's very difficult to get the blanket to actually cover your backside entirely like this, and the hospital blankets were not that big, so I'm reasonably sure that in trying to alleviate my pain I was also displaying my ass and genitals to all of the attending staff-- three nurses-- and possibly others in the recovery room as well.\n\nOne of the nurses went to fetch some kind of opioid to help with the pain. While that was happening, I was acutely aware of the intense ache in my vulva and pelvis. For the men in the subreddit who are not in the know, masturbating helps with period pain, and I was still reasonably sure that the blanket was covering me entirely and nobody would know. So in my delirious state I decided to rub the offending anatomy to try and reduce the pain. One of the nurses closed the curtain surrounding me and then he told me he was going to get me a second blanket \"for warmth\". When he returned with it he placed it a little lower over my body, covering my lower body and legs. I didn't really put what this meant together until later.\n\nTo their credit, they took it very well and didn't actually say anything, and it is possible they didn't see it, but reflecting on their reactions and the chain of events in clear-eyed hindsight I'm pretty sure they did. To be fair, if any of them were present for the surgical procedure they would have seen me while I was unconscious as well, but it's a different thing when I'm awake and, well, you know.\n\nAnyway, now I'm recovering in bed at home. The pain has went away but the embarrassment has only increased. At least I humiliated myself for a good cause, and I'll probably never see these people again.\n\nTL;DR: Was in pain and woozy after an operation in hospital, may or may not have masturbated in front of the nurses.",

Or at least maybe a little mockery will help turn this from a humiliating story to a funny one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I had an egg retrieval operation in the hospital as part of an egg donation. This is a surgical procedure in which a needle is inserted into the vaginal wall to the ovary, collecting mature eggs to be fertilized. (While normally you only have one, injections are administered for about two weeks beforehand to increase the number of eggs matured in one cycle-- in my case there were about 25 eggs). The retrieval is done under anaesthetic, which I&amp;#39;m going to blame for all my poor decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything was going swimmingly until I woke up. For about ten minutes I was totally fine. Then I felt like absolute shit. I&amp;#39;ve done this once before but it didn&amp;#39;t hurt this bad. It felt like period pain, if you were having twenty-five particularly bad periods all at once. The cramps were so bad one of the first things I did once it hit was roll over and throw up (though that could have actually been the nausea from the anaesthetic-- I am not sure).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was an IV in my left arm so I didn&amp;#39;t want to curl up on my left on top of it, and I tried to curl up on my right but that left my left arm in very uncomfortable position too, so I opted to roll into the fetal position while lying on my back-- that is, with my knees lifted in the air up against my chest and my calves and feet hovering parallel to the bed. This did help with the pain a little. What I realised later when recreating this position at home later is it&amp;#39;s very difficult to get the blanket to actually cover your backside entirely like this, and the hospital blankets were not that big, so I&amp;#39;m reasonably sure that in trying to alleviate my pain I was also displaying my ass and genitals to all of the attending staff-- three nurses-- and possibly others in the recovery room as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the nurses went to fetch some kind of opioid to help with the pain. While that was happening, I was acutely aware of the intense ache in my vulva and pelvis. For the men in the subreddit who are not in the know, masturbating helps with period pain, and I was still reasonably sure that the blanket was covering me entirely and nobody would know. So in my delirious state I decided to rub the offending anatomy to try and reduce the pain. One of the nurses closed the curtain surrounding me and then he told me he was going to get me a second blanket &amp;quot;for warmth&amp;quot;. When he returned with it he placed it a little lower over my body, covering my lower body and legs. I didn&amp;#39;t really put what this meant together until later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To their credit, they took it very well and didn&amp;#39;t actually say anything, and it is possible they didn&amp;#39;t see it, but reflecting on their reactions and the chain of events in clear-eyed hindsight I&amp;#39;m pretty sure they did. To be fair, if any of them were present for the surgical procedure they would have seen me while I was unconscious as well, but it&amp;#39;s a different thing when I&amp;#39;m awake and, well, you know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now I&amp;#39;m recovering in bed at home. The pain has went away but the embarrassment has only increased. At least I humiliated myself for a good cause, and I&amp;#39;ll probably never see these people again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Was in pain and woozy after an operation in hospital, may or may not have masturbated in front of the nurses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

She would have been cutting in front of me to turn into her neighborhood.\n\nInstead of completing the turn though, she locks eyes with me and smiles, slows down, and decides to let me cross the street before she makes her turn. \"How nice,\" I think.\n\nExcept, BANG!!! The car behind her wasn't paying attention. He rear ends her HARD, and the front of his car crumples. The sound was insane. This all happened in the span of seconds, and I happened to be looking straight at the spot where their cars made contact. After it happens I just stand and stare for a few second with my jaw wide open. I couldn't believe it.\n\nThe lady lost her rear bumper, but her car came out relatively okay. The other guy's car is effed. Neighbors that heard the crash came out to see what had happened. Auspiciously, there had been a police officer speaking with someone right on the other side of the street. They jumped into action and radioed for help, and started directing traffic.\n\nThere was an ambulance on the scene I shit you not in like 20-30 seconds. Thankfully everyone came out unscathed (besides the emotional trauma lol). And realistically, this lady was being way too nice. She should've just completed her turn and not slowed down for me. But I still can't help but feel guilty \ud83d\ude2d literally a difference of a few seconds either way and I wouldn't have been in that exact spot, and she WOULD have just completed her turn.\n\nOffered her my contact info incase she needs a witness for anything, but since the officer also saw the accident, she figured it would be fine. Praying for this lady that everything works out. And if you're reading this - follow the rules of the road people.\n\nTL;DR: Lady stopped traffic to let me cross the street and got rear-ended real bad.

    "selftext": "I came home from a work trip today to two workers eating lunch on the front stoop of my apartment building. I got out of my Lyft, gathered all my bags, and tried to get past them and into my building without any of my luggage slamming into them. They apologized for being in the way and I let them know it was no problem at all as I made my way inside without incident. Upon entering, I saw that the first floor hallway was lined with a bunch of new cabinets, and that the apartment straight ahead and to the back right had its door wide open. I could see that a few of the pieces of furniture in the apartment, \"1R\" were covered in plastic.  \n\nI'm friends with my downstairs neighbors, so I texted them asking if they were just getting new cabinets because it was time, or if there was some kind of flood. Pete replied a few minutes later that it was just an update that the landlord was doing as the old ones were rotten.

They apologized for being in the way and I let them know it was no problem at all as I made my way inside without incident. Upon entering, I saw that the first floor hallway was lined with a bunch of new cabinets, and that the apartment straight ahead and to the back right had its door wide open. I could see that a few of the pieces of furniture in the apartment, &amp;quot;1R&amp;quot; were covered in plastic.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m friends with my downstairs neighbors, so I texted them asking if they were just getting new cabinets because it was time, or if there was some kind of flood.

    "selftext": "My girlfriend (20F) and I (21M) have been together since I was 15 and she was 14. We have an excellent relationship, we've only had about four arguments in six years, and none of them were serious. I have no doubt she's the woman of my life.\n\nHere's how the problem started: for some years, I've seen many women complaining about how frustrating it is to be a girlfriend for a long time. For example, some say \"I've been with the same man for 9 years and I'm still just a girlfriend\" and how uncomfortable they feel in that situation. I understand how bad that can be, and I wanted my girlfriend to know I take our relationship seriously. At the same time I'm far from being financially stable enough to get married, so my solution was this: I would propose now, but we'd get married in about five years. That way we could tell people we're engaged, and she wouldn\u2019t have to be a girlfriend for 11 years before becoming a fianc\u00e9e.\n\nWe're on vacation now, and yesterday I proposed to her. She was extremely happy, cried a lot, and I was happy and cried too. But when we got back to the hotel, she asked me how I wanted the wedding to be. I told her \"I don't think it's worth planning the wedding now since we're only getting married in about five years.\" She instantly got sad and went to the bathroom for a few minutes. I apologized to her, but she was not talking to me (when she's extremely sad she usually stays completely silent). After some time she said she wanted to talk about it on Friday, that it was okay, and she wanted to enjoy the rest of our vacation.\n\nIt's clearly not okay I shouldn't have done this. I thought she would be happy and understand my point of view (which we still haven\u2019t talked about yet because I'm respecting her space), but now I think I tried to fix a problem that didn\u2019t exist and ended up hurting her. Looking back she never complained about being a girlfriend for six years, I don't know why I thought this was necessary.\n\n\n\n  \n**UPDATE:** I followed the advice from the comments, and it was really just a communication problem. Earlier today, we talked about it. I explained what my idea was and showed her this post. She laughed about it and said that doing this suits my character, lol. She said she wouldn\u2019t mind being my girlfriend for 10 years because we are still young and it didn\u2019t matter to her. She mentioned that I could have explained my idea to her before proposing, but in the end it was fine and she said it was cute that I thought about doing this.\n\nI apologized a million times, and we decided together that I\u2019ll propose to her again in a few years, and the wedding will happen a year after the proposal, like a normal couple. She\u2019ll wear the ring I gave her because she liked it, and if someone asks us about our relationship, we\u2019ll say that we\u2019re getting married soon.\n\nNow, addressing some things I\u2019ve seen in the comments: it\u2019s important to me that we have a wedding (ceremony), but we are definitely going to live in the same house before our wedding. This year, I\u2019ve stabilized myself in a situation which I believe the best way to explain to an American is: you're making $120k a year but instead of living in NYC, you live in a medium-sized city where the cost of an excellent life is $5k a month. So we\u2019re definitely moving in together early next year, but our wedding will have to wait a little longer.\n\nSome people thought I proposed but didn\u2019t want to get married (and that\u2019s my fault for communicating poorly). I do want to get married, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible right now. We both would rather move in together before having our wedding (we\u2019ve talked about it). Another clarification is that, for me, getting married means having the wedding, not moving in together. She thought I meant we wouldn't move in for another 5 years, which isn't the case. again, my fault for not explaining it well.\n\nThanks for all the comments!\n\n**TL;DR:** I asked my girlfriend to marry me but I only wanted to get married in 5 years and I ended up hurting her feelings.",

I didn't really know what all of the separate settings do, so I'd just turn on any that heats up the oven and works for what I'm making. \n\nI decided to try and bake some apples with sugar and cinnamon, and the recipe said that it must be covered in tinfoil while it's baking. I didn't have any but I had parchment paper so I figured that that must be fine and I didn't want to go out and buy tinfoil (the nearest shop is 20 minutes away and I didn't really have the time, + I just couldn't be bothered). Parchment paper is usually very safe to use in the oven as well, and at home there was 0 risk and that's what I was used to, so I didn't really think too much about it. \n\nIt went swimmingly for most of the time the apples were in the oven, until I opened the oven and slightly adjusted the parchment paper to better observe the state of the apples, when all of a sudden it caught on fire. At that point I was just confused and scared, I wasn't aware it was possible to start a fire in the oven with parchment paper, and naturally there was a risk the fire would spread. One of my two flatmates who was there at the time started pouring water into the baking tray, and the other flatmate went to open windows and doors while I took the tray out of the oven and ran it under the water to put out the flames. All I was left with were some apples with a goopy, undercooked topping, surrounded by the charred remains of the parchment paper. \n\nIt turned out that I had turned on the fan and grill setting, and the parchment paper must have touched the grill above it, which then started the fire. So yeah, I won't try baking again any time soon.\n\nTL;DR: I turned on the fan and grill setting due to being unfamiliar with fan ovens, covered what I was baking in parchment paper, the parchment paper touched the grill and set on fire.

One of my two flatmates who was there at the time started pouring water into the baking tray, and the other flatmate went to open windows and doors while I took the tray out of the oven and ran it under the water to put out the flames. All I was left with were some apples with a goopy, undercooked topping, surrounded by the charred remains of the parchment paper. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It turned out that I had turned on the fan and grill setting, and the parchment paper must have touched the grill above it, which then started the fire. So yeah, I won&amp;#39;t try baking again any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I turned on the fan and grill setting due to being unfamiliar with fan ovens, covered what I was baking in parchment paper, the parchment paper touched the grill and set on fire. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "Obligatory \"on mobile\" disclaimer. \n\nSo it's not what you're thinking. They're not that kind of special. To give a little back story, my wife and I have been trying to eat healthier lately, tracking our calories and protein and vitamins, minerals, all that. Over the last few weeks, we've realized that, on a good day, we get maybe 15 to 20 grams of fiber, despite eating vegetables and fruit with at least 2 of our meals. So we've been dedicating extra attention to upping our fiber intake, and now we're getting at least 20, sometime up to 40 grams a day. \n\nSo, today, I come home and my wife is sitting on the couch. I go into the kitchen, and there is almost a whole 9\u00d713 pan of brownies sitting on the counter. I ask if she's saving them. She says no. I ask if I can have some. She says \"of course baby, eat as much as you want, they're healthy.\" That was all I needed to hear. I grab one and start eating it. It's a little dry, texture is a little off, but it's not bad. I start on dinner, eat another one. At this point, I think it's important to say that the hardest part of keeping my calorie intake down is I snack if given the opportunity. Not bad when it's carrots or cherry tomatoes, but if there's sweets, they have to be out of sight or I'll find myself just grabbing and eating without thinking about it. A bad habit from when I quit smoking and snacked to keep my mouth busy, I guess. \n\nAs I finish cooking, I realize I've eaten five of these brownies. So, I do the logical thing and grab a sixth, eating it as I walk of the living room to tell my dear wife, who said to eat as many as I want, that I might have to make her some more brownie and I'll need the recipe for her healthy browned. She gets a confused look on her face, followed quickly by concern, and replaced almost immediate with amusement. \n\"Honey,\" she says, \"how many brownies did you eat?\" \n\"Six,\" I say, after swallowing the last bite, slightly apprehensive at her poorly concealed amusement. \"Why, is something wrong?\"\n\"Well that depends on your time frame for wrong, honestly. Right now, no, nothing is wrong in 30 minutes to an hour? Maybe.\"\n\nAt this point, I'm beginning to get concerned, and she, thankfully, didn't keep me waiting for long on the reason for her amusement. \n\"I didn't make those brownies. My coworker did. I told her about us needing more fiber and she said she had the perfect recipe. Each one of those brownies is supposed to have about 7 grams of fiber in them, and you ate 6 of them.\"\n\nAt this point, I knew I had made a horrible, horrible mistake, but I tried to reason with myself. Maybe I've been getting enough fiber that it won't be like the time I jumped from almost no fiber to eating a fiber 1 bar with an Olli pop with my lunch and painted my backside with blue porta potty water 45 minutes later. Maybe it won't be so bad, besides, how could 1 brownie have 7 grams of fiber? They weren't amazing, but they were better than the fiber brownies you get at the store. Alas, my hope was for naught. No sooner had I finished dinner, and my stomach rumbled in a way that spoke of the horrors to come. Immediately, I made haste to the porcelain throne, yelling to my wife that she would have to serve dinner tonight. No sooner had I taken my seat that the floodgates were blown wide open. I'll spare you the details, but suffice is to say that I was seated on my throne for over an hour, and needed a shower after. \n\nSuffice is to say, my rear is tired, the bathroom still smells of my regret, and my wife can't look at me without chuckling and has made it known she will be telling the evil person who made the brownies about how well they worked on her poor, unsuspecting husband. I will be asking how healthy these random snacks are from now on.\n\n\nTL;DR, in an attempt to get more fiber, my wife's coworker made brownies with 7 grams of fiber and I ate 6 not knowing, and paid the price for it. \n\n\nEdit to add the same copy and pasted reply I've put in comments\nhttps://divaliciousrecipes.com/flaxseed-chocolate-brownie/#recipe\n\nThis is the recipe my wife's coworker says she used as her base, but she changed it up to make them better. How, I don't know, but she swears the only difference is they have more protein and a few more calories, but it's not by much",

I go into the kitchen, and there is almost a whole 9\u00d713 pan of brownies sitting on the counter. I ask if she&amp;#39;s saving them. She says no. I ask if I can have some. She says &amp;quot;of course baby, eat as much as you want, they&amp;#39;re healthy.&amp;quot; That was all I needed to hear. I grab one and start eating it. It&amp;#39;s a little dry, texture is a little off, but it&amp;#39;s not bad. I start on dinner, eat another one. At this point, I think it&amp;#39;s important to say that the hardest part of keeping my calorie intake down is I snack if given the opportunity. Not bad when it&amp;#39;s carrots or cherry tomatoes, but if there&amp;#39;s sweets, they have to be out of sight or I&amp;#39;ll find myself just grabbing and eating without thinking about it. A bad habit from when I quit smoking and snacked to keep my mouth busy, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I finish cooking, I realize I&amp;#39;ve eaten five of these brownies. So, I do the logical thing and grab a sixth, eating it as I walk of the living room to tell my dear wife, who said to eat as many as I want, that I might have to make her some more brownie and I&amp;#39;ll need the recipe for her healthy browned. She gets a confused look on her face, followed quickly by concern, and replaced almost immediate with amusement. \n&amp;quot;Honey,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;how many brownies did you eat?&amp;quot; \n&amp;quot;Six,&amp;quot; I say, after swallowing the last bite, slightly apprehensive at her poorly concealed amusement. &amp;quot;Why, is something wrong?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Well that depends on your time frame for wrong, honestly. Right now, no, nothing is wrong in 30 minutes to an hour? Maybe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I&amp;#39;m beginning to get concerned, and she, thankfully, didn&amp;#39;t keep me waiting for long on the reason for her amusement. \n&amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t make those brownies. My coworker did. I told her about us needing more fiber and she said she had the perfect recipe. Each one of those brownies is supposed to have about 7 grams of fiber in them, and you ate 6 of them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I knew I had made a horrible, horrible mistake, but I tried to reason with myself. Maybe I&amp;#39;ve been getting enough fiber that it won&amp;#39;t be like the time I jumped from almost no fiber to eating a fiber 1 bar with an Olli pop with my lunch and painted my backside with blue porta potty water 45 minutes later. Maybe it won&amp;#39;t be so bad, besides, how could 1 brownie have 7 grams of fiber? They weren&amp;#39;t amazing, but they were better than the fiber brownies you get at the store. Alas, my hope was for naught. No sooner had I finished dinner, and my stomach rumbled in a way that spoke of the horrors to come. Immediately, I made haste to the porcelain throne, yelling to my wife that she would have to serve dinner tonight. No sooner had I taken my seat that the floodgates were blown wide open. I&amp;#39;ll spare you the details, but suffice is to say that I was seated on my throne for over an hour, and needed a shower after. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suffice is to say, my rear is tired, the bathroom still smells of my regret, and my wife can&amp;#39;t look at me without chuckling and has made it known she will be telling the evil person who made the brownies about how well they worked on her poor, unsuspecting husband. I will be asking how healthy these random snacks are from now on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR, in an attempt to get more fiber, my wife&amp;#39;s coworker made brownies with 7 grams of fiber and I ate 6 not knowing, and paid the price for it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit to add the same copy and pasted reply I&amp;#39;ve put in comments\n&lt;a href=\"https://divaliciousrecipes.com/flaxseed-chocolate-brownie/#recipe\"&gt;https://divaliciousrecipes.com/flaxseed-chocolate-brownie/#recipe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the recipe my wife&amp;#39;s coworker says she used as her base, but she changed it up to make them better. How, I don&amp;#39;t know, but she swears the only difference is they have more protein and a few more calories, but it&amp;#39;s not by much&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Winston, now perched on my head, looked like a drowned rat who&amp;#39;d just survived a hurricane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I managed to wrestle him free and wrap him in a towel. He&amp;#39;s currently sulking under the bed, plotting his revenge, I&amp;#39;m sure.  The bathroom looks like a swamp monster threw a tantrum in it. And I smell faintly of tuna and potting soil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Tried to give my cat a civilized shower. Ended up with a flooded bathroom, a traumatized cat, and a newfound appreciation for professional groomers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: clearly should have made my title say &amp;quot;pussy&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;cat&amp;quot; for the updoots&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I loved my hair the first few times I went to her, but after that, my hair was coming out noticeably different every time.

After several of these instances, I was so disappointed with my cut and color and finally decided to go to a new salon. I never gave her a reason or anything, just stopped scheduling appointments with her. Fast forward to now, I have been going to a new stylist at a different salon (I'll call her Anna), and have been super happy with my cut and color the past few times I have gone to her. Today, I found out via social media that Maggie (1st stylist) just got a new job at Anna's salon (the place I am going now). Now, if I go for another appointment with Anna, there's a good chance Maggie will see me. Super awkward... I'm now considering if I need to find yet another salon and risk hating my hair again, just to avoid the embarrassment and awkwardness. I guess I should have seen this coming since I live in a small town with only a handful of salons... oh well.\n\n  \nTL;DR: I ghosted my old hair stylist, but she just got a job at the new salon I started going to, so it's going to be hard to avoid the awkwardness.",

    "selftext": "See edits below for answers to some FAQs\n\nI (26 F) and my husband (28 M) have been married for 5 years and have known that him about that long as well. Before I get into this let me give a little backstory because it provides some necessary context. We both grew up in a high demand religion with a very intense purity culture. It is not uncommon in the culture of our religion to marry young and fast, and start having kids right away. We unfortunately fit right into that stereotype. We were just two horny young people who dove head in and there was no one around us telling us no. The last five years haven\u2019t been easy but we do genuinely love each other and have both put in a lot of effort to make it work and this last year especially has been a good year for us. \n\nI mention the above because part of what we\u2019ve been working on is being more affectionate and intimate with each other. So we were in bed and we were just having some pillow talk, telling each other things that we liked about each other. At one point I told him that I thought about him all the time when he\u2019s gone for work (works a very demanding job, with overnight 12.5 hour shifts), how handsome I think he is and how much I miss him.\n\nHere\u2019s  where I fuck up- I also tell him I think about him when I touch myself and imagine that it\u2019s him. He looks at me and looks away and is CLEARLY uncomfortable. He says \u201cOh\u201d. \nAnd I\u2019m like\u2026 \u201coh? What\u2019s wrong? Does that make you uncomfortable?\u201d\nAnd he says that it caught him off guard and he is a little uncomfortable.\nY\u2019all I was shaking in my boots. I\u2019m like \u201cyou are my husband. I have two children with you. We\u2019ve been married and have been having sex for 5 years. Why on gods earth would it make you uncomfortable to know that your wife thinks of you in moments of private?\u201d\nAll he had to say to that was that it just surprised him. I pushed for more details but admittedly I probably sounded upset (because I was), he got defensive, so I just dropped it because I honestly don\u2019t even know what to say. \n\nI should\u2019ve known it would go down like this. This man absolutely refuses to talk about sex outside the act itself. Will not sext, will not flirt, NOTHING, which is a complete 180 from when we were dating/engaged. It\u2019s been a thing I\u2019ve tried to respect but also have had to talk him about and remind him that I\u2019m his wife not his best buddy, thus us working on affection and intimacy with one another. I don\u2019t know if the purity culture has just screwed with him and created a mental block in his head regarding sex, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s related to me and how he feels about me.

We are also okay with each other watching porn as well. I also know for a fact that my husband doesn\u2019t do it often as he\u2019s monitored constantly at work and then at home he\u2019s always with us and usually falls asleep before me, so I don\u2019t think those are the root of the problem here. \n\n3. It became very clear early on in our marriage that I have a high libido and he has a low one, so we\u2019ve had to navigate through that and haven\u2019t always done it well. ",

Before I get into this let me give a little backstory because it provides some necessary context. We both grew up in a high demand religion with a very intense purity culture. It is not uncommon in the culture of our religion to marry young and fast, and start having kids right away. We unfortunately fit right into that stereotype. We were just two horny young people who dove head in and there was no one around us telling us no. The last five years haven\u2019t been easy but we do genuinely love each other and have both put in a lot of effort to make it work and this last year especially has been a good year for us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mention the above because part of what we\u2019ve been working on is being more affectionate and intimate with each other. So we were in bed and we were just having some pillow talk, telling each other things that we liked about each other. At one point I told him that I thought about him all the time when he\u2019s gone for work (works a very demanding job, with overnight 12.5 hour shifts), how handsome I think he is and how much I miss him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s  where I fuck up- I also tell him I think about him when I touch myself and imagine that it\u2019s him. He looks at me and looks away and is CLEARLY uncomfortable. He says \u201cOh\u201d. \nAnd I\u2019m like\u2026 \u201coh? What\u2019s wrong? Does that make you uncomfortable?\u201d\nAnd he says that it caught him off guard and he is a little uncomfortable.\nY\u2019all I was shaking in my boots. I\u2019m like \u201cyou are my husband. I have two children with you. We\u2019ve been married and have been having sex for 5 years. Why on gods earth would it make you uncomfortable to know that your wife thinks of you in moments of private?\u201d\nAll he had to say to that was that it just surprised him. I pushed for more details but admittedly I probably sounded upset (because I was), he got defensive, so I just dropped it because I honestly don\u2019t even know what to say. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should\u2019ve known it would go down like this. This man absolutely refuses to talk about sex outside the act itself. Will not sext, will not flirt, NOTHING, which is a complete 180 from when we were dating/engaged. It\u2019s been a thing I\u2019ve tried to respect but also have had to talk him about and remind him that I\u2019m his wife not his best buddy, thus us working on affection and intimacy with one another. I don\u2019t know if the purity culture has just screwed with him and created a mental block in his head regarding sex, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s related to me and how he feels about me. I genuinely don\u2019t know and I honestly don\u2019t know if he knows either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway I\u2019m up and still thinking about it, I went to bed shortly after that conversation, just feeling really disappointed and somewhat rejected in a way. What I do know is that his reaction has definitely ruined my own \u201cprivate time\u201d with myself because if he pops up in my head during it, I\u2019ll just remember what he said and it will totally kill the mood.

When I was being filthy and irresponsible by not washing my empties out, it actually killed the flies because it was too strong.

Now they drink the watered down sour, don't die, and I have a bunch of fruit flies. I have fruit fly traps setup all around them, but they only go for the empties. I am ashamed that I drink, but I am also ashamed of how much I've spent on fruit fly traps in the last couple weeks. I tried some home remedies too, but they keep going for the water down empties. My fuck up is probably from drinking in general, but let's focus on the flies. When I have the opportunity to clean up, they all go to the compost bin; I'll throw that out and then they go after the cats food. I'll go through a period of no flies, or I think so, and then I'll crack a beer and realize the flies are there again. Do they hibernate or lay dormant like fleas? I have enough spiders, there shouldn't be any flies. Did I mess up by propagating lazy spiders? I did notice that the house spiders will eat the jumping spiders if they catch them. \n\nTL;DR Made strong beer tolerable for fruit flies",

    "selftext": "So this actually happened over 2 years ago while my mom and I were in Paris. I was 18 at the time and had just graduated from high school. Since I graduated with my Associates Degree at the same time by taking dual enrollment classes in high school, my mom put together a special trip for the two of us to go to Paris for a week as my \"double graduation\" gift.  \n  \nCut to night 1 of the trip and I\u2019m absolutely blowing up the bathroom after holding it in all day (hot girls have stomach issues, amiright?). I lost count of the amount of times I flushed the toilet after the eighth flush. I went through almost an entire roll of shitty ass hotel toilet paper in one sitting. The rest was a blur until I was finally done. Then, after the last flush, the toilet bowl water started bubbling rhythmically. Three bubbles. Blub\u2026 blub\u2026 blub. I pass it off as nothing to worry about and go about my day.  \n  \nDay 2: the bubbling is still there. Blub. Blub. Blub.   \n  \nDay 3: It\u2019s happening quite regularly now, probably at a frequency of once every other minute. My mom and I were a little concerned, but passed it off yet again because we thought it would just go away\u2026 Famous last words.  \n  \nDay 4: The next morning, I wake up to a horrendous odor and my mom calling for me from the bathroom. While we were asleep, the toilet overflowed and FLOODED our hotel room with poo water. That's right, poo water \\[insert Bee Movie reference here\\]. The whole room reeked and the carpet was damp. We had to wear shoes inside the hotel room for fear of getting anything on our socks or bare feet. My mom, like the trooper she is, cleaned up as much of the mess as she could using the towels we had in the bathroom. The floor was still covered in shit and sewage, though, so she called the concierge to let them know about the situation, then sent me to go grab more towels from them. After I brought the extra towels, we mopped up as much as we could before we got dressed and ready for our plans that day. By the time we were almost ready to leave, we heard a knock at the door. It was the plumber.  \n  \nThe plumber didn't speak much English but the concierge had already given him the run-down of the situation. We let him in and when he rounded the corner to see the bathroom and get a full whiff of the stench, he exclaimed what I can only assume was some curse in French. After around five minutes of attempting to plunge the toilet, he realized he didn't have all of the tools he needed.   \n  \nThis is my mom's favorite part: When he came back out of the bathroom, he looked at us and WAGGED HIS FINGER while repeating, \"No... no... no good... no...\" before leaving the room to go get more supplies from his vehicle. At this point, my mom and I were ready to go, so we left to get breakfast at a cafe that was about a 20-minute Uber ride from the hotel. We explored the surrounding area for a bit before Uber-ing back to the hotel.  \n  \nWhen we got back, the door to our room was propped open. The plumber was not alone. Two other men were now in our hotel room trying to fix the toilet. The craziest part? They had to \\*remove the toilet from the wall\\* because it was that bad. We didn't plan on staying for long, we just had to get changed into nicer clothes to go to a restaurant we had made a reservation for that was more upscale than our casual clothes would allow. We grabbed our change of clothes, got changed in the lobby bathroom, then dropped off our things in the room before heading off to lunch.  \n  \nFast forward a couple of hours later: The three men are still there and the toilet is still off the wall. They gave us a rough estimate of when they would be done, which was probably going to be another 2-3 hours. During this exchange, they all kept shooting glances at us that were a mix of disgust and befuddlement. I can only imagine they were talking amongst themselves throughout the day saying things like, \"Ugh, these Americans and their bowels,\" and, \"What the actual fuck did those women EAT?\" We told them that the wait was completely fine, thanked them, and apologized profusely. When we got in the elevator, out of earshot, we burst out laughing because of how insane the whole thing was. We're like children when it comes to poop/fart jokes, so even though this was a serious issue and we felt really bad for the plumbers, we still thought it was absolutely hilarious.  \n  \nWe had about an hour and a half to kill before we had to leave for our reservations at Versailles, so we decided to go for a walk to a quaint little bakery nearby that had some tarts we wanted to try, then brought our tarts back to the lobby where we sat for the next hour. Long story short, we returned at around 7:30 pm and were informed the room wasn't quite ready yet as it was being cleaned and were told to return in about an hour. We thanked the concierge, apologized for the trouble, then went to grab a late dinner down the street.  \n  \nUnfortunately, when we got back to the room later that night, the shit smell lingered. We put two and two together and figured the plumbers had to have been there for at least 6 hours of the day from start to finish, given the first guy had arrived at around 10:00 am and they had to have all left between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm. We were still reeling from the whole situation and couldn't help but burst out laughing for what seemed like the 50th time that day. After that, we made a rule that courtesy flushes were a must after two wipes so we wouldn't run the risk of clogging or damaging the frail little toilet again.  \n  \nSince then, this has probably been the funniest personal story I've ever told. We're going back to Paris in a couple of months AND we're staying at the same hotel, so hopefully I won't repeat the same mistake this time lol.  \n  \nTLDR: If you've ever wondered, \"How many Frenchmen does it take to fix a toilet?\" The answer is 3.",

I\u2019m pregnant so I like sitting in the bath with some snacks and today I was starving so I made a crisp sandwhich. Got my cheese and onion on white bread and I\u2019m living it up, I put it on my little bath table and I get in. \n\nI\u2019m watching penguinz0 and chilling when I take my first bite into said sandwhich. Taste is 10/10 but weirdly it feels like there\u2019s GLASS in the sandwhich and I hear a SNAP, pain radiated through out my lower jaw. I continue chewing thinking haha just a bit of pain in my canine haha! Every bite tho I\u2019m feeling snap, snap, snap. Well I swallow and my mouth is filling with blood and it hits me, I\u2019ve just literally knocked my own tooth out eating the softest crisp sandwich. \n\n30 miles to the nearest emergency dentist to be told they can take out the rest which they do, I have a panic attack and now im left with a gap where my left lower canine used to be. I\u2019m supposed to getting a bridge (although if anyone could say whether a bridge of leaving it is worth it let me know as I can\u2019t afford an implant!) \n\nTLDR: I was eating a crisp sandwhich in the bath and took a huge bite and when I crunched I snapped canines out. Travelled 30 miles to be told I have to get a bridge with another dentist. I can\u2019t eat Aldi cheese and onion again. ",

I\u2019m pregnant so I like sitting in the bath with some snacks and today I was starving so I made a crisp sandwhich. Got my cheese and onion on white bread and I\u2019m living it up, I put it on my little bath table and I get in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m watching penguinz0 and chilling when I take my first bite into said sandwhich. Taste is 10/10 but weirdly it feels like there\u2019s GLASS in the sandwhich and I hear a SNAP, pain radiated through out my lower jaw. I continue chewing thinking haha just a bit of pain in my canine haha! Every bite tho I\u2019m feeling snap, snap, snap. Well I swallow and my mouth is filling with blood and it hits me, I\u2019ve just literally knocked my own tooth out eating the softest crisp sandwich. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;30 miles to the nearest emergency dentist to be told they can take out the rest which they do, I have a panic attack and now im left with a gap where my left lower canine used to be. I\u2019m supposed to getting a bridge (although if anyone could say whether a bridge of leaving it is worth it let me know as I can\u2019t afford an implant!) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I was eating a crisp sandwhich in the bath and took a huge bite and when I crunched I snapped canines out. Travelled 30 miles to be told I have to get a bridge with another dentist. I can\u2019t eat Aldi cheese and onion again. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "Obligatory: not today, but the mistake is once again on my mind.  \n\nAbout two years ago, I went to northern California with my named beneficiary. We hiked along the coast and among the redwoods. It was lovely -- beautiful rugged coast, tall trees, faint aroma of barbecued Ewok.\n\nA few days after we got back, I developed a rash on my face and wrist. One of my eyes swelled nearly shut. I get contact dermatitis from Tide and other products, so I figured it was an allergic reaction. I tried to medicate with Benadryl and cortisone cream, but it kept spreading.\n\nAfter a few days of intense discomfort, I went to see a nurse practitioner. She said, \"That's poison ivy.\" I told her that was not possible, because I had not been anywhere outdoors for a couple of weeks... except California, but the rash started a few days *after* I got home. She said, \"Well, then it's poison oak. It can persist on clothing for weeks.\" \n\nI got the poison ivy soap. I got the poison ivy spray. I took repeated scalding showers and applied goo liberally. My face got better quickly, but my wrist stayed bad and then my left ankle and right calf got horrifically itchy. It was not like burning or pain, it was just an urgent need to scratch and it was *always* there. I realized I was 'reinfecting' myself. \n\nI can't be 100% sure, but I think I must have brushed a piece of clothing against poison oak while on our hike. I then managed to take the item off without contacting the urushiol, and then put it in my dirty clothes bag and brought it home to launder. I then washed that laundry in cold water, because that's good for the clothes and the environment.\n\nBut cold water and detergent do nothing to urushiol. It's an oil. It does not dissolve in cold water. Tumbling clothes around and around together in a warm dryer does give urushiol plenty opportunity to spread. Every single item of clothing in that load was exposed, and by the time I realized what happened, they had all been folded and put away. \n\nI collected every possible item of clothing that had been on that trip or had been touched by an item in that trip -- probably 70% of my casual wardrobe, in four or five loads -- and ran all of it through the washing machine twice on 'hot'. I wrecked some wool socks, but honestly I couldn't bear the thought of putting them back on, knowing they might be contaminated. Slowly, the rash got better, though my right calf was the last to stop itching weeks later. \n\nSo okay, lesson learned, that's all behind me -- right? Except any time my right calf gets itchy -- sunburn, mosquito bite -- the whole thing gets itchy just like the poison oak. I got a mosquito bite on that calf in the last few days, nearly two years since the trip, and again the whole calf is itchy. I can treat it with OTC creams, but it's still a huge annoyance. \n\nIt's great to wash your clothes on the cold setting. They last longer! So does the planet! \n\nBut if you're out where you might be exposed to poison oak or poison ivy, wash your clothes with warm or hot water when you get home. You won't give half a fart about the saving the environment after you've spent two weeks trying to scrape it out from underneath your skin. \n\nI do still love the environment, but I'm also really glad washed all my underwear on the normal environment-destroying warm temperature after that trip. If my man parts had itched as much as my calf did back then, I would have lost my mind. \n\nTL;DR I washed clothes exposed to poison oak in cold water, thus spreading the poison to an entire load of clothing. The resulting exposure left me miserable for months, and the itching recurs from time to time. .",

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obligatory: not today, but the mistake is once again on my mind.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About two years ago, I went to northern California with my named beneficiary. We hiked along the coast and among the redwoods. It was lovely -- beautiful rugged coast, tall trees, faint aroma of barbecued Ewok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days after we got back, I developed a rash on my face and wrist. One of my eyes swelled nearly shut. I get contact dermatitis from Tide and other products, so I figured it was an allergic reaction. I tried to medicate with Benadryl and cortisone cream, but it kept spreading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few days of intense discomfort, I went to see a nurse practitioner. She said, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s poison ivy.&amp;quot; I told her that was not possible, because I had not been anywhere outdoors for a couple of weeks... except California, but the rash started a few days &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; I got home. She said, &amp;quot;Well, then it&amp;#39;s poison oak. It can persist on clothing for weeks.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the poison ivy soap. I got the poison ivy spray. I took repeated scalding showers and applied goo liberally. My face got better quickly, but my wrist stayed bad and then my left ankle and right calf got horrifically itchy. It was not like burning or pain, it was just an urgent need to scratch and it was &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; there. I realized I was &amp;#39;reinfecting&amp;#39; myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t be 100% sure, but I think I must have brushed a piece of clothing against poison oak while on our hike. I then managed to take the item off without contacting the urushiol, and then put it in my dirty clothes bag and brought it home to launder. I then washed that laundry in cold water, because that&amp;#39;s good for the clothes and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But cold water and detergent do nothing to urushiol. It&amp;#39;s an oil. It does not dissolve in cold water. Tumbling clothes around and around together in a warm dryer does give urushiol plenty opportunity to spread. Every single item of clothing in that load was exposed, and by the time I realized what happened, they had all been folded and put away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I collected every possible item of clothing that had been on that trip or had been touched by an item in that trip -- probably 70% of my casual wardrobe, in four or five loads -- and ran all of it through the washing machine twice on &amp;#39;hot&amp;#39;. I wrecked some wool socks, but honestly I couldn&amp;#39;t bear the thought of putting them back on, knowing they might be contaminated. Slowly, the rash got better, though my right calf was the last to stop itching weeks later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So okay, lesson learned, that&amp;#39;s all behind me -- right? Except any time my right calf gets itchy -- sunburn, mosquito bite -- the whole thing gets itchy just like the poison oak. I got a mosquito bite on that calf in the last few days, nearly two years since the trip, and again the whole calf is itchy. I can treat it with OTC creams, but it&amp;#39;s still a huge annoyance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s great to wash your clothes on the cold setting. They last longer! So does the planet! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;#39;re out where you might be exposed to poison oak or poison ivy, wash your clothes with warm or hot water when you get home. You won&amp;#39;t give half a fart about the saving the environment after you&amp;#39;ve spent two weeks trying to scrape it out from underneath your skin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do still love the environment, but I&amp;#39;m also really glad washed all my underwear on the normal environment-destroying warm temperature after that trip. If my man parts had itched as much as my calf did back then, I would have lost my mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I washed clothes exposed to poison oak in cold water, thus spreading the poison to an entire load of clothing. The resulting exposure left me miserable for months, and the itching recurs from time to time. .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "I was working at home very late and got hungry so I threw a frozen egg, sausage, and cheese biscuit in the microwave. I cook most stuff in the microwave on a low setting. My oven has inverter technology so it's particularly good at cooking slowly. Low-power cooking with an inverter allows the food to heat more evenly, and cooks certain things better - like without changing texture. These biscuits come out heated perfectly through every time. It's truly amazing.\n\nSo I put it in for 6 minutes at 20% power. When it was done I flipped the sandwich over and set it for another 12 minutes. I returned to my desk and worked. My mind was deeply in my work. \n\nI'm always smelling food being cooked by neighbors and sometimes they make really good smelling stuff. After a couple minutes sitting my there I noticed the smell of something delicious - but only in the background. I didn't think about it - it registered way in the back of my mind somewhere.\n\nAfter another couple minutes, I smelled someone baking a cake or something. It was a unique sweet aroma, and again it smelled delicious. For this, my conscious mind picked up on it just enough to sort of think \"Wow, that smells amazing, but why are my neighbors baking at 2:00 am?\"\n\nAnother minute, again deeply focused, I started to detect something uncomfortable happening, but I couldn't pull my mind away from my work (ADHD hyperfocus is a bitch). Another minutes after that I became aware of what the discomfort was - I was something burning. My neighbors totally screwed up. Oh well. Again, I was deeply focused.\n\nAnother minute and the smell pulled me out of my work-focus and I thought \"They really burnt the shit out of their food.\"\n\nFINALLY, my brain was able to get a message to me - \"DUDE! YOU'VE GOT FOOD IN THE MICROWAVE! IS THAT WHAT'S BURNING!?\"\n\nI jumped up and ran to the kitchen and the smell got really strong, and then I saw the microwave. Thick, dense, brown-gray smoke was pouring out the top like some kind of industrial waste-burning chimney. The room was filling with the acrid smoke quickly. It was very uncomfortable to breathe. I opened the microwave and once the rest of the smoke cleared I saw my biscuit. A charred lump of black ex-food, smoldering, still emitting whisps of smoke.\n\nIt turned out that I set the oven time for 10 minutes but I was so focused on my work that I forgot to set the power to 20%, so the thawed biscuit continued to cook at 1100 watts for 8 minutes. My kitchen exhaust fan was on, so the aromas and smoke were mostly pulled out the window so it took a long time for it to reach me.\n\nSince I didn't smell it quickly, the oven had the opportunity to cook the living crap out of the sandwich. It had probably been smoking for a couple minutes and I didn't didn't smell it. I opened windows and let the exhaust fan clear all the smoke. For the next week, everything in my kitchen continued to smell like that awful smoke. It's now two weeks after that happened, and the kitchen is okay except for my expensive inverter technology microwave which still smells as if there's currently burning waste inside.\n\nThe smoke was so dense it had to have coated all the electronics inside with thick soot. I'm sure the smell will go away, but at this point I'm thinking 4 months, and I imagine the soot will shorten it's life. Bummer, man.\n\ntldr: Forgot to properly set the microwave and filled my kitchen with smoke from the burning food inside.",

I was completely out of the antibacterial handsoap.  \nSo I decided to have a quick look under the sink to see if we had any new bottles, and what I found was a gag gift my brother had gotten me, \"probacterial handsoap\".\n\nI was like, \"Awesome, this finally has a purpose.\" so I used it. Well, I'm starting to wonder if it was actually a gag gift now, because my head is pounding, my mini trashcan is filled with snot covered tissues and I'm coughing phlegm like a madman.  \nSo I tried to look for the soap online, because there was no way it was actually the soap that made me sick.  \nBut I couldn't find anything about it. I don't know where the hell he got it, but It's like it doesn't even exist.  \nDo people sell soap that makes you sick on the black market or something?   \nI mean, on the plus side, if it is the cause... I know what I'm looking to when I want to get out of something.\n\nTL;DR: Ran out of antibacterial handsoap, and used a gag gift called \"probacterial handsoap\" and now I have a cold.",

I was completely out of the antibacterial handsoap.&lt;br/&gt;\nSo I decided to have a quick look under the sink to see if we had any new bottles, and what I found was a gag gift my brother had gotten me, &amp;quot;probacterial handsoap&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was like, &amp;quot;Awesome, this finally has a purpose.&amp;quot; so I used it. Well, I&amp;#39;m starting to wonder if it was actually a gag gift now, because my head is pounding, my mini trashcan is filled with snot covered tissues and I&amp;#39;m coughing phlegm like a madman.&lt;br/&gt;\nSo I tried to look for the soap online, because there was no way it was actually the soap that made me sick.&lt;br/&gt;\nBut I couldn&amp;#39;t find anything about it. I don&amp;#39;t know where the hell he got it, but It&amp;#39;s like it doesn&amp;#39;t even exist.&lt;br/&gt;\nDo people sell soap that makes you sick on the black market or something?&lt;br/&gt;\nI mean, on the plus side, if it is the cause... I know what I&amp;#39;m looking to when I want to get out of something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Ran out of antibacterial handsoap, and used a gag gift called &amp;quot;probacterial handsoap&amp;quot; and now I have a cold.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I\u2019ve had plenty of flying experience but I\u2019ve always hated flights as I get sick extremely easily and also tend to get anxious on the plane. My boyfriend sat behind me because we couldn\u2019t get seats together, so I was stuck in the middle seat between a woman and another guy. An hour and a half before landing, I decided to order an instant soup cup because I wasn\u2019t feeling good and pretty hungry. I downed it and half an hour later, the plane began to descend. I was already feeling the anxiety that had lingered for the entire flight. It was extremely bumpy and the turbulence was getting really bad. My stomach was churning and I prayed for the best, but unfortunately, I felt everything in my stomach rising up my throat. I immediately grabbed the vomit bag that was in front of me and within 10 seconds all of the soup that I ingested was out. I couldn\u2019t really see what the reactions around me were, but I think they were pretty shocked. I kept going for another 20 seconds until I was done. I was shaking at this point, hands trembling while I hold onto the bag of bile. I stared into nothing, horrified, I have never done this before in my 10+ years of flying. But it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s in the bag, and I\u2019m fine, right? And then, the worst thing that could possibly happen at that moment happened, the plane shook violently and I lost grip of the bag. Oh fuck. The bag dropped and spilt all over the floor infront of me, landing on my shoes, the woman beside me\u2019s legs and her shoes. I could\u2019ve died there and then. We were both lost for words but I tried to apologise as best as I can while she gave me some wet wipes to clean up and she took off her shoes to clean it. The guy beside me attempted to move away from me as best as he could, he was lucky to have escape unscathed. It took the entirety of the landing duration to clean up as best as we could. I apologised to her again after the flight landed and she said \u201cIt\u2019s okay I work at an ER, I\u2019ve seen a lot worse.\u201d Props to her for handling it so well and not going insane at me, ER workers are built different. Yes I did tell and apologise profusely to the flight attendants after the flight. Definitely was a horrible start to a good holiday.\n\nTLDR; Threw up on long distance flight in the bag but dropped the bag onto someone else.",

It was my choice since a few months before breaking up I started feeling like the relationship was more of a chore, rather than a commitment. I decided to break up with my ex since I thought she didn't deserve that. She understood, and we ended the relationship in good terms.\n\nMy ex doesn't matter here, it's what happened after her. Literally a month after I broke up with my ex, I met this one girl through one of my closest female friends and she was great. She showed great interest in me, initiating conversation with me on the daily and was always very sweet to me. I liked her too, but then I thought of why I was single in the first place. I decided to not lead her on, and started making it clear I only wanted her as a friend, because I genuinely found her to be a great person to keep around, but I didn't want to risk it by dating her and it not working out because I wasn't in the right place to do it. I just thought it would've been selfish.\n\nTo this day she is a great friend to me and has become one of my closest ones through time. However, things have changed, she is now in a relationship and honestly it never bothered me. I never felt jealousy and they've been together for a few months now I think. Just this morning she texted me, asking for advice on a small issue they had going on. I don't even know what the fuck happened from that point on. I gave her advice, she said thanks, then next moment we started talking about my stance on relationships (I have told her that I've been avoiding them for a while) , then she started telling me about how she used to have a crush on me when we first met. \n\nI knew she did, but having her say it just felt different. I thought I moved on and that the feelings I had for her were platonic, but holy it felt soo much different. I like to live life with no regrets, but this is definitely it, and I do not enjoy the feeling. I still think I have no real interest in dating her, especially now that she has a boyfriend, but brother I can't stop thinking of what could've been. This shit has been on my mind all day and it's making my brain hurt.\n\nTLDR; Girl had crush on me right after I broke up with my ex. I wasn't ready for relationships, so I kept her as a friend. A year later she has a boyfriend and told me she used to have a crush on me. I give up on love.",

I just thought it would&amp;#39;ve been selfish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To this day she is a great friend to me and has become one of my closest ones through time. However, things have changed, she is now in a relationship and honestly it never bothered me. I never felt jealousy and they&amp;#39;ve been together for a few months now I think. Just this morning she texted me, asking for advice on a small issue they had going on. I don&amp;#39;t even know what the fuck happened from that point on. I gave her advice, she said thanks, then next moment we started talking about my stance on relationships (I have told her that I&amp;#39;ve been avoiding them for a while) , then she started telling me about how she used to have a crush on me when we first met. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew she did, but having her say it just felt different. I thought I moved on and that the feelings I had for her were platonic, but holy it felt soo much different. I like to live life with no regrets, but this is definitely it, and I do not enjoy the feeling. I still think I have no real interest in dating her, especially now that she has a boyfriend, but brother I can&amp;#39;t stop thinking of what could&amp;#39;ve been. This shit has been on my mind all day and it&amp;#39;s making my brain hurt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR; Girl had crush on me right after I broke up with my ex. I wasn&amp;#39;t ready for relationships, so I kept her as a friend. A year later she has a boyfriend and told me she used to have a crush on me. I give up on love.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

He would also barely tell me why saying \"i have shit to do\" and last week he cancelled because he wanted to practice by himself. He never told me any other reason as to why he couldnt make it. i told him that he just didnt want to go to practice on saturday and yet again he said he had shit to do. i told him that he never said any other reason other than wanting to practice alone. he told me he had other responsibilities and i told him to just find another date that he is free to practice. his response was telling me to put a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger. i asked him if he was free to practice this week and he told me probably not because he had shit to do and i asked him what he had to do. he ended up telling me a reason that he had never told me before, expecting me to know that it was the reason he couldnt make it. i felt horrible that i didnt know, i apologized, sent him sympathies, said we didnt have to worry about the band until his situation got better but he didnt care. he ended up telling my ex, who now hates me, she told her friends (and also wouldnt let me tell my side of the story), i have lost everyones respect, my friend hates me, even though i feel awful for misunderstanding, everyone hates me and i lost my best friend.

There were leftovers, and she told me that they were in the kitchen if I wanted some when I got up.  After waking, I went to the kitchen and grabbed a roll and tossed it in the toaster oven to rewarm it.  Then I opened the fridge to grab the cream cheese icing she made.  The last time she did, I had mentioned the recipe was a little *too* cream-cheesy, so she tried a different recipe this time.  There it was, in a glass measuring cup on the top shelf.  At this point it was cold and hard to spread, so I popped out a few tablespoons and put it on my now hot roll and let it soften and then spread it around.\n\nI sat down at my work computer and at my roll while checking emails and messages.  As I ate, I noticed the icing wasn't particularly sweet, but also didn't taste like cheese at all.  But it was also a bit smoky?  Or maybe that was the cinnamon roll?  Either way, I was hungry and I finished my roll and my first morning meeting.  Curious about the icing, I asked my wife if she used the recipe my sister had sent us yesterday, and she said she had.  I noted it was a bit smoky and not very sweet and she was confused.  I mentioned where I had pulled the frosting from, and she cackled, \"THAT'S NOT ICING, THAT'S BACON GREASE!\".  So I responded in kind, \"WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE ICING?  AND WHERE IS THE ICING??\"  Apparently, the icing was on the counter, still in the mixing bowl.\n\nAs I write this, my stomach is occasionally gurgling, like a thunderstorm on the horizon, and my wife is shaming me to her sisters and mine, and anyone else she can get ahold of.  I expect in a few hours greased lightning will be shooting from my anus and my wife will be laughing outside the door.  I'll die steadfast in my belief that bacon grease looks just like icing, and honestly didn't taste half bad on the cinnamon roll.\n\nTL;DR: I accidentally put several tablespoons of bacon grease on my cinnamon roll instead of cream cheese icing, and ate the whole thing.",

Trigger warning: if you're easily grossed out, you might want to skip ahead.\n\n\n\nI (34M) attended a celebration party for one of my friend, and in the middle of the party, I was feeling hungry, so I went to see what the choices of the foods are. Among the many selections, I noticed on the corner of my eyes, they served, as optional sides, Asian chili peppers. The way that we usually eat it is bite a portion of it after you took a bite of your food to make your food spicy. You can also use it for cooking ingredients to spice up your dish, but this time, the host served it raw on a bowl.\n\n\n\nYa boi here is accustomed to eating many spicy foods throughout his life &amp; even ate Asian chili peppers plenty of times, so this is nothing to me! I grabbed a good amount alongside my foods because I will go to town with this peppers! I noticed some people took a tiny bite off the peppers, but not me! I haphazardly bit off half of the peppers with each bite of my food, so if my math is mathing, 1 pepper is good for 2 bites. I took it like a champ! Every time I get more foods, I get more of these peppers, and I swore, I think I consumed more peppers than the other guests combined. Keep in mind that there's no alcohol involved to make this kind of decision, but oh boy...curse my hubris.\n\n\n\nAfter the party dissipates and the majority leaves (including me), the moment I arrived home, my stomach was churning, screaming, begging for me to release whatever I consumed. My gut is now in control, so I went to the toilet, preparing to do my business, and this is the beginning of my realization that I screwed up majorly. The next 15-20 minutes were a torture session, because, as you all realize, what comes in...must come out. My butthole feels like the gates of hell itself. My rectum is on fire and I'm in agony! I was sweating profusely, body shaking, mind aching, and constantly afraid every time my gut is telling me to \"open wide\".\n\n\n\nWorst part 1: I was pushing so hard &amp; in pain at the same time that I didn't realize I gave myself hemorrhoid. After I cleaned myself up, the pain lingered, followed me wherever I go. Every time I clenched, it taunted me, told me that there's nothing I can do about the pain. It does slowly dissipated over time, which is good.\n\n\n\nWorst part 2: What I released from my newfound gates of hell is just the beginning. Apparently, my gut thinks it's funny to put me in a multiple torture session throughout my evening instead of one go, because in every 30 minutes interval, it's telling me that I have to \"open wide\" again, and repeat the whole Baghdad all over again. This happened in a total of 5 times, even gave me rude awakening in the middle of my sleep. I swore, I was in a fetal position in my bed, begging whatever deities that put me in this endless loop of torment to stop.\n\n\n\nMaybe I wronged someone in my past life &amp; was now took their revenge from the gates of hell I just opened up, but I'm glad the torture is over...for now...\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I was way too overconfident to consume an ungodly amount of Asian chili peppers, resulting in giving myself an endless torture session, provided by my own gut.",

I&amp;#39;m going to be standing at the altar thinking about my new husband, and the pastor certainly might be too!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: As in the title, I accidentally showed a very intimate photo of my partner to the man that will officiate our wedding and I have no idea how to face him on the day of.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

They read this story about a teacher whose student found out his dad may not be his dad, due to having a blood type that would not be possible based on his parents blood types.\n\nA little background info: I will sum up my family relationship as a whole by saying it is straight up complicated and I have the therapy bills to prove it lol. My parents divorced a few years ago and my mom moved away. I have since started to heal and work on myself instead of laughing everything off and detaching.\n\nNow, I have always had little suspicions about my dad being my bio dad. I can see where I look like my mom, but not my dad. The features I share with my sister, are my moms. I have a few that nooo one in my family has. My dad was not on my birth certificate, which was vaguely explained. But when looking for my birth cert years ago I found my mom\u2019s divorce papers from AFTER I was born. My parents got married when I was 2 or 3 I think. But it\u2019s never mattered deep down because my dad is my dad and that will continue to be the case. I have no interest in changing that regardless so besides a few jokes here and there I never looked into it.\n\nThat is, until I decided to watch that episode, and without thinking but just being excited about punnet squares, text my dad asking his blood type. Now my mom is type O, and I know this bc what kind of narcissist would she be without informing everyone that she is a universal donor. So when my dad said A+, I went \u201c\u2026..\u201d and speedily opened up google and what do you know THEY CANT MAKE A B- BABY LIKE ME NOW CAN THEY\n\nI verified with him my mom is O and then told him to call me. Then IMMEDIATELY REGRETTED IT and breathed a sigh of relief when he said he was golfing and would later. And then IMMEDIATELY called my grandma (she\u2019s a real one, ultimate confidant) and asked if she knew any secrets and explained the situation (and how genetics works which was a journey and made me sound real smart, so at least there\u2019s that) and she was not helpful but bless her for trying. \n\nChatted with my dad on the phone, he was kinda like wtf and he looked for his blood donor card while we chatted about things. Books, tv, his girlfriends kids starting school. We were both pretty chill about it. He couldn\u2019t find it but did tell me that my mom was actually still very married to this man, but he said they had a horrible relationship, and it seems like they may as well have been estranged/separated/whatever like I was told. But they lived together\u2026..neither of us seemed surprised, and later over text he said he was always curious but it wouldn\u2019t change anything. \n\nSo, we may take a Walgreens paternity test this week when we have our planned dinner. I feel incredibly guilty for making this a thing when I\u2019m either completely desensitized to the point I don\u2019t care, or I really don\u2019t care. Either way, it does not change anything for me. He will remain my dad that I love and look up to, and I will not be going on some \u201cwho is my real dad\u201d kind of journey. That\u2019s not my thing. However I may have just inadvertently hurt my dad, causing or reopening a wound that I feel so guilty for. I wish I had not been curious, I pray that he really is all \u201cwow color me surprised\u2026not\u201d about it like he seemed. I always joke that the one thing I got from my dad was his sense of humor and skill at COD. Praying to the universe I did get his sense of humor and it matches in this scenario (blood or not blood). I will be so mad at myself if I am hurting him.\n\n\nI fun fact-ed myself too close to the sun, I fear.\nDon\u2019t worry, I will update \n\n\n\nTLDR; Shayne Topp from iCarly read a story about blood types spotlighting paternity inconsistencies. Realized my blood type spotlighted paternity inconsistencies. My dad doesn\u2019t seem to be my bio dad, I fear I am causing him unnecessary pain bc to me he is still the only dad I want &amp; I shouldn\u2019t have dug.\n",

I was very active and went to the gym 5x a week back then so I could pick her up and toss her around easily. That was 10+ years ago. Since then, I had a health issue that made me lose 25lb. I\u2019m better now but I obviously also lost a lot of strength from that. We\u2019ve also had two kids so obviously my wife put on some weight from that and wasn\u2019t able to lose it all after like she wanted to.\n\nMy wife now weighs 160lb and I want to make it very clear that I absolutely love it. That extra 25lb went to all the right places, if you know what I mean. I do not think she\u2019s fat or overweight, I have never said that, or even joked about it. I think she\u2019s the sexiest woman alive.\n\nSo earlier this year, our youngest started school so we finally had 100% alone time at home for the first time in years (neither of us have family nearby). So we started messing around throughout the house, just like we did before kids. But I noticed I couldn\u2019t lift, carry, or toss her the same way I did when we met. So I decided it\u2019s time to hit the gym again since it\u2019s been years and I only weighed 175. I\u2019ve been working out for 6 months, gained about 10lb already, and got a lot stronger. My wife noticed the muscle gain and we started talking about working out and she asked why I decided to start again out of nowhere. So without thinking about how it sounds, I told her exactly why \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. \n\nIn my head, she\u2019s perfect, and me struggling to lift her is my problem, not hers. But obviously she sees it differently. She\u2019s not super pissed or anything, but I can tell she\u2019s a bit bummed about it. She\u2019s a confident woman and she\u2019ll be just fine in a day or two but I should\u2019ve worded it differently or just made up a different reason when she asked lol.\n\nTL;DR:\nWife gained a few pounds after pregnancies, I lost weight and strength due to a health issue a few years back so I was struggling to lift/carry her. I started working out to be able to lift her easier and accidentally told her that\u2019s why I started working out. ",

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my wife and I met, she was about 135lb and I was 200lb. She\u2019s 5\u20198\u201d and I\u2019m 6\u2019. I was very active and went to the gym 5x a week back then so I could pick her up and toss her around easily. That was 10+ years ago. Since then, I had a health issue that made me lose 25lb. I\u2019m better now but I obviously also lost a lot of strength from that. We\u2019ve also had two kids so obviously my wife put on some weight from that and wasn\u2019t able to lose it all after like she wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife now weighs 160lb and I want to make it very clear that I absolutely love it. That extra 25lb went to all the right places, if you know what I mean. I do not think she\u2019s fat or overweight, I have never said that, or even joked about it. I think she\u2019s the sexiest woman alive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So earlier this year, our youngest started school so we finally had 100% alone time at home for the first time in years (neither of us have family nearby). So we started messing around throughout the house, just like we did before kids. But I noticed I couldn\u2019t lift, carry, or toss her the same way I did when we met. So I decided it\u2019s time to hit the gym again since it\u2019s been years and I only weighed 175. I\u2019ve been working out for 6 months, gained about 10lb already, and got a lot stronger. My wife noticed the muscle gain and we started talking about working out and she asked why I decided to start again out of nowhere. So without thinking about how it sounds, I told her exactly why \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my head, she\u2019s perfect, and me struggling to lift her is my problem, not hers. But obviously she sees it differently. She\u2019s not super pissed or anything, but I can tell she\u2019s a bit bummed about it. She\u2019s a confident woman and she\u2019ll be just fine in a day or two but I should\u2019ve worded it differently or just made up a different reason when she asked lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:\nWife gained a few pounds after pregnancies, I lost weight and strength due to a health issue a few years back so I was struggling to lift/carry her. I started working out to be able to lift her easier and accidentally told her that\u2019s why I started working out. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

May 2023, I realised I developed some feelings for R, and requested for some space in our friendship, so that I can sort out the feelings. I went to therapy, worked on myself and was able to move past the feelings and got in contact with R again and we slowly began to become friends again. Few months ago, we had an honest conversation about although she has moved past the incident, she sometimes gets uncomfortable and overthink if she is giving me some signals. The main reason for this is that unfortunately I am an overwhelmingly clingy person and can often give a lot in friendships and sometimes that can be a lot for her and can make her uncomfortable. She also confesses that she hasn't had any close guy friends, because most of them would develop feelings for her and then cut off contact with her and I am the only friend who started talking to her again. We had a discussion and decided that I will try to respect her boundaries more and she will try not to overthink too much whenever we are just being friends. \n\nNow, let's come to what happened last weekend. I went on a trip with some of my friends (but not R) and I found a really cool hat which was perfectly R's style and 100% would have suited her. I did not think about it properly and impulsively bought it for her. It costed me 15 Dollars, which is not too bad for me. When I gave her the hat, I realised she actually got a bit uncomfortable. Then she pointed out the discussion from a few months ago, that this is what she was talking about that me buying something for her, is a fine line, but is kind of crossing the boundaries and makes her a bit uncomfortable. It immediately hit me then that I came on too strong, and seemed like a creep because I bought something specifically for her. She did say that she knows that I didn't have bad intentions and was just trying to be a friend, and she doesn't like saying this either, but this is something that did make her uncomfortable. We did decide that I will take the hat back, but I feel like a shitty person at the moment. I definitely messed up really bad and in hindsight it all was kind of creepy. At this moment, I am not concerned about how she sees me, but I am really worried that I hurt a good friend of mine. I did apologise to her profusely but that won't fix the fact that I did hurt her. I feel like just going into a corner and staying there or just completely moving away. I know it will all be okay again, but I did break the trust that I was building over last few months and I feel awful about putting her in this position.\n\nTLDR: I impulsively bought a hat as a gift for a friend I used to have crush on and made her uncomfortable and ended up hurting her",

All he had to do was get up and go to school and I'd be home after school that night. \n\nWell on my way out the door I jokingly said \"no parties\" thinking nothing of it. \nI attend the funeral. Make my way home. Everything is good. \n\nSaturday comes around, I wake up, step outside to smoke. And there's a note on my door.. it says,\" I have pictures of your son sucking a big pick veiny dildo. I'm almost as big. Want to let let me smash\"\n\nLe sigh.. it's 7 am on a Saturday. I'm too old for this shit.  So I immediately check my box of adult toys that I keep under my bed. And be damned if I'm not missing a big pink veiny dildo. I woke my son up, shoved the note in his face and I'm like \" what is this\".\n\nBeing a typical teenager he's like \" I don't know\" \nThen I'm like \"where is it\"\nAgain \" I don't know\" \n\nIt's now 715 in the morning on a Saturday and I'm on my way to his friends house. Madder than hell. I knock on the door. Mom answers the door with the cutest little baby money on her shoulder. I ask for her son.

So now I know who wrote the note. Some kid I never even met. \n\nThen I have to proceed to yell at these 2 sleepy teenage boys about privacy. And how violated I feel. This went on for a good 10 minutes. Cause I was mad and felt violated. Lucky the boys mom was very considerate, and let me say my piece. She had seen pictures and videos of whatever they did with the dildo. All the pictures had been deleted by the time I got to them. \n\nLadies and gentlemen do you know how hard it is to yell at 2 sleepy teenage boys at 7 30 am on a Saturday.. When all you want to do is pet the little baby monkey. But you can't cause you've been yelling for the last 10 minutes and have scared it. \n\nTldr: went out of town.

    "selftext": "I have a Microsoft office 365 account for work. One time probably 2 or 3 years ago I was trying to transfer a spreadsheet from my work account to my home computer, so I logged onto my Microsoft account on my phone. I immediately logged out afterwards and my work requires me to change my password every 3 months. There is zero reason my phone should be connected to my work account still.\n\nWell, I read on reddit sometime in the last few years that Bing's video search engine with safe settings off is really good for porn. They were right. I've been using it as my primary porn search engine ever since. This morning I logged onto my work computer and they did a system \"upgrade\". Anything we had customized on our desktop was reset and they removed all browsers aside from Microsoft Edge for whatever reason.

It's doubly worse because we recently had a latin secretary I had a fling with that nobody really knows about (but people talk).

    "selftext": "This did not happen today, but just about a year ago. At the time, my wife and I were married for about a year.  My wife and I have very opposite interests, but we both support each other in the things that the other loves.  \n\nFor example, I love going to different conventions, dressing up in costume, meeting celebrities, and checking out the unique merchandise that is sold. My wife is a big football fan, and will never miss a game if she can help it. My wife will come to conventions with me and I'll watch the games with her and occasionally we make it to one in person.  \n\nA lot of people have questioned our dynamic because of our interests. To distill it down simply, I was a theater kid who wrote for the school newspaper and she played softball and loves football. People asked how on earth we fit together, even my mother, but we balance each other very well and I can't see myself with anyone else.  \n\nMy wife pointed out to me at one point that even if my interests aren't her thing, she loves that when I do my favorite things, the fact that I want her to be a part of them speaks volumes about how I feel about her and I feel the same way.  \n\nOn to the fuck up. Last year we attended a game for her favorite NFL team. Her dad bought tickets for the entire family and invited us to get there early to tailgate in the parking lot.  \n\nAs we were getting ready, my wife stated that as we would be grilling in the parking lot and going through a crowded stadium, it might be prudent to leave our wedding rings at home. Earlier in the year, a stone fell out of mine when we were on vacation, and I searched for an hour before finding it. So I agreed with her.  \n\nI jokingly asked her what we should say if anyone asks why we're not wearing our rings. My wife rolled her eyes and said nobody would notice that. I said that someone was bound to notice it and we need to come up with something funny to say. We decided that if anyone asked, we would whisper, \"Well, we're working on things...\" and just leave it at that.  \n\nWell, we arrived, had a great time, and nobody said anything. We posted several group photos to Facebook and Instagram along with photos of us grilling in the parking lot. About ten minutes later, my mother texted me.  \n\n\"Why aren't you guys wearing your wedding rings in the photo you put up on Facebook?\"  \n\nI showed it to my wife, and we both cracked up laughing.  \n\nSo I sent the following back, \"Well, we're trying to work on things, but the tickets were already purchased, so...\"  \n\nWe had a good laugh, forgot about it, headed inside, and had a great time.  \n\nCue the end of the game. We headed out to our car, waited in the queue to get out, and then began to drive home.  \n\nAbout five minutes into the trip, notifications start going off on my phone. I hadn't realized that the stadium had terrible cell service, was essentially a dead zone, and didn't bother to connect to the stadium WiFi.  \n\n\"I know you're kidding, but please confirm that for me...\"  \n\n\"It's really not funny to joke about. I'm very nervous about you guys...\"  \n\n\"What does that mean you're working on things? Why aren't you wearing your rings?\"\n\n\"Please pick up your phone.\"  \n\n\"This is not to week to do this to me, I am freaking out right now!\"  \n\n\"Why aren't you answering your phone?\"  \n\nBy the time I called to assure her that I had simply been joking, she had already called multiple relatives freaking out that my wife and I were splitting up and I wasn't answering the phone. When they heard the details, everyone else thought it was pretty hilarious. My mother, however, did not, and is still angry that we pulled that on her.  \n\nTl; Dr - Posted photos without our wedding rings on social media. Led my mother to believe we were breaking up and due to no service, she didn't find out it was a joke until 6 hours later.",

    "selftext": "So recently, I started going to the playground with my 2-year-old. He loves it \u2013 slides, swings, the whole deal. It's been great, especially since he gets tired out, making bedtime a breeze. But... I seriously messed up.\n\nIt's been getting colder, so he's been wearing longer pants \u2013 those soft polyester ones because they're warm. The playground has plastic slides and metal stairs, which means a lot of static electricity gets built up.\n\nThe first time it happened, he went down the slide, I grabbed his hand to help him off, and zap \u2013 static shock. He looked confused but shrugged it off. He goes down the slide again, and zap, it happens again when I grab his hand. Now he's visibly upset, not crying, but giving me that \"what the hell, Dad?\" look.\n\nThis has been happening for the past 3-4 playground trips, and now he outright refuses to hold my hand. Every time I reach for him, he says, \"Dada, no poke.\" He still wants to go outside but won't touch any of the playground equipment except the swings.\n\nThe worst part? He somehow managed to shock himself on the metal stairs, and now he won't hold the railing either, which is definitely not safe for a toddler.\n\nSo yeah, no more playground for us for a while. I\u2019ll just have to deal with longer nap times until he forgets about the \"pokes.\"\n\nTL;DR: Static shocks from the playground slides have traumatized my kid, and now he won\u2019t hold my hand or use half the equipment.",

    "selftext": "So this happened in the last 24 hours. My wife wife and I are poly. She's bi so we both get to date women. There is a girl at my work who is recently divorced who I've been friends with for past 6 months. No feelings by either party. Well I told her about being poly and we had became pretty close. Well I'm dumb cause this is where I fucked up. I'm on the spectrum and have a hard time with girls hitting on me. I can never get it right. Anyways I thought I was crazy cause over text we were friends but in real life she seemed like a different  person. I thought I was looking into it too much maybe she's being nice and that's all. Well she came into work after her shift alittle drunk cause she was going to drink with the other servers at my work. I made her some food and then she got really close to me kept touching me. She even said I looked really nice and that she liked my eyes. We talked about some other stuff. She asked if I wanted to come with to the bar. I declined cause I was tired and live far away. She asked for a hug I gave it to her and they left. I thought at this point she liked me, but I didn't know if it was the drinking or if she actually did. We texted that night she apologized for the hug I told her it was OK so now I'm confused. Finally, last night we were texting all day. I was still really confused cause she's way out of my league but I didn't know how to feel. I wanted to clear the air. I asked her if we could talk about that night cause I was confused. I said that were the vibes I was picking up real because I feel crazy. I also said that I didn't want to lose our friendship over something that isn't there. She said that she was just tipsy and that she only saw me as her friend. Things seem even weirder. We texted alittle after that I said that I'm happy that we are just friends and that I'm good with that. I just needed clarification. Now things feel so awkward and I feel like I lost a friend.\n\nTLDR - I thought a friend was into me turned out she was just drunk.",

Sorry about formatting, I'm on mobile\n\nSunday I try to tidy my house, visit family and get ready for the work week ahead.\nIm a single woman, recently bought my own place and live alone. \n\nThis morning, after waking up, I was a little bored and horny so I took one of my toys to have some fun.\nIt's purple, vibrates and is double appendaged (sorry about details but they're important lol).\n\nAfter I finished having my fun I went to the bathroom, washed my friend but instead of drying it I left it hanging on the towel rack using the appendages to hook it onto the rack.\nI had to go out to the shops and then went to see family.\n\nEnded up going to lunch with my sister  and niblings and invited them to spend time at my place...completely forgetting about my little friend in the bathroom...\n\nThank God we stayed in the backyard, the kids were distracted helping me build a few chairs and playing with a kid friendly axe game I recently bought.\n\nMy sister went inside to use the toilet where she had a \"dizzy spell\" after washing her hands in the \"kitchen\".\n\nAbout 15mins later she and the kids left and I walked into the bathroom, saw my purple friend was still hanging there and freaked out. \nI rang my sister straight away and asked \"You said you used the kitchen sink to wash your hands yeah?\"\nShe said \"Um yeah, whys that?\"\nI was relieved and just said \"No reason. Just asking.\"\n\nHours passed, I fired up my new BBQ and was cooking some sausages when I got a text from my sister. \nHere's the text exchange word for word:\n\nSis: \"Urgh...

    "selftext": "Just started a new serving job at a small restaurant downtown in my city. I have worked three shifts before this, and the atmosphere there is super cute and intimate and everyone is lovely, and it is CRAZY busy around dinner time. \n\nI hopped in the shower a couple hours before my shift and started having intense cramps and nausea. I\u2019d had been (tmi) painfully stuck on the toilet before that. I ended up taking a few tylenol about 1.5 hrs before my shift, but they didn\u2019t help my stomach and I was honestly feeling pretty weak.

She's from out of town (30ish minutes away by car), so she's at my place on and off.\n\nYesterday I had a relative's birthday at a bar ( private event ) so I decided to invite her since she doesn't really go out anymore. I worked in the morning and had the chance to have a Tequilla tasting with a guy who drinks Tequilla for a living, which was amazing since I could get tipsy for my shitty shift. Then, I worked my regular 12 - 10 pm shift, got back home at 11, showered, and went straight to the party with my SO and family.\n\nWe all had a great time she sipped on her virgin cocktails while I destroyed my wallet and got shit faced. Everything was going perfect we danced, socialized, saw some people that I hadn't seen in years and the bonus was that I was drunk but nowhere near my limit ( blacking out, fumbling or puking ).\n\nWe stayed till around 3 am. before we finally decided it was time for us to go. We get home, change into our pyjamas, and hit the sack.\n\nNow, this is when the FU happens. See, I have a history of sleepwalking ( alcohol makes it more likely to happen ), and it turns out I was gonna relive what usually ends up being a funny story.\n\nSo those who are familiar with somnambulism will know that you'll generally have little or no memory of these incidents, so all I have is my SO's testimony and the evidence  i had the next morning ( unusable work attire ).\n\nEssentially I woke up in the middle of the night/morning got up and went to the corner of the room where she had her purse, she found it a bit weird since I was just kinda staring at the wall. Until she heard a noise that sounded like a stream, confused as she was, she started to put two and two together and started yelling and berating me. I stopped turned around and stared at her for a few seconds and then went to finish what I started in the right place. After a minute or two, I came back to our room, ignored her cleaning my mess, and went back to bed.\n\nSafe to say, I got the cold shoulder in the morning until we finally talked and laughed about it. I had already told her I was a sleepwalker and a few funny stories that happened in the past. Now, she one upped me in embarrassing stories to tell our future child.\n\nTL;DR: Sleepwalked and pissed in my girlfriend's purse.\n\n( Not sure if this is against the no Pissing or Shitting thyself rule since I technically didn't lol probably would've been better tho )",

And initially I didn't say anything about it, but I was honestly irked. The next day (The day before my birthday),  I confronted her shoplifting the dumb keychain. And she said \"Its not my fault, its just how I was raised\", and I got pissed off and told her to take accountability for her actions instead of blaming other people for her mistakes, then she \"took accountability\" by blaming it on her mental illnesses, which IMO shouldn't be ones scapegoat, and that's not taking REAL accountability for your actions. Which I told her. And we got into the worst fight in my life, and even though it was just words...It felt like I was hit by a train.

He had to try a few switches before getting the right one, and in retrospect I wish I asked him to help me get my fuse box labeled. That aside, he turned off the power in my bedroom at some point. But that wouldn't really do anything right? \n\nWell, I found out that, no, that *would* actually do something. The guy finished up what he was doing outside, then went back downstairs to turn the power back on. When he came back into the living room, where I was, he had a grin on his face. I didn't think much of it. I paid for his service and he left.\n\nAfter that, I went into the basement to check that none of my cats went down there. As I passed my bedroom, I noticed my image LED light had turned on when the power got restarted. I thought it was neat. I checked the basement, then came back upstairs. This time I *really* looked into my room at the light. \n\nI was watching it change colors when I realized something. I was so used to it that I hadn't thought twice about where the light was placed. It was in a very dark room on top of a display case full of adult toys. I keep my room dark so it was hard to see much, but it was obvious what was in the case even in the dim light. That would have been bad enough, unfortunately that was not all. I air dry my toys after cleaning them by putting them *on top* of the case. In front of the light was a large dragon dildo. And in front of that was a second *larger* dragon dildo. \n\nI understood why the electrician smiled at me the way he did.

So back story. \n\nI (f31) and my little sister (f27) work at the same store. I was at a different location but this year I transferred to the store she works at as a manager 3 levels higher than her. I have a degree in baking and ran a bakery for 5 years and my sister hates that I do because that is \"what she wanted to do\" as we both spent our childhood baking rhe grandma and it was always a special thing for us. It is always an argumentbetweenus about 100% from scratch (her side) or more times than none from scratch but always open to using mixes or pre formed product (me). At my old store I always made special treats for holidays or whenever I got stressed out. And my coworkers at my old store all loved my baked goods to the point that ot looked like the wildebeast scene from the lion king. My sister also did the same at her store\n\nMy sister expressed to coworkers when I moved stores that she was worried the people at her store would love my baked goods more than hers. Because of this, I just avoided bringing sweets all together and just kept them to neighbors or something of I was stressed.\n\nIt came to a head this month because for work we started our month long charity fundraiser. We were finally given permission to do a bake sale to raise money so I jumped in because I am used to mass production. So I made quite literally 200 dozen cookies (if not more), about 40 loaves of banana bread, peanut brottle, snack mixes of all kinds, and easily 45 dozen muffins over the course of a month. And whenever I brought product in, our coworkers would scavenge the boxes before even getting to the sell table and more times than none sold out of product within 12-18 hours. Meanwhile, my sister made cinnamon rolls and brownies and sold almost none in 2 days. She then went off in a huff, made a small scene about throwing everything in the garbage, and never brought product in again. \n\nNow, the fundraiser is over so obviously the bake sale is done. But now she hears from all of our customers and coworkers about how amazing the food was and of ill ever make more. Several regulars came in asking for the recipes. My sister made a whole show and said \"the stuff isn't even from scratch\". Which is a lie and she knows it. The only thing that wasn't 100% scratch was the muffins and it was still a dry mix. But one customer told her \"I don't care of it's not from scratch, they taste delicious!\". And since then, she has not brought anything to work, doesn't want to bake, and stopped talking to me about opening up her own bakery. I feel like an asshole but I also feel like she needed a reality check a bit.\n\nWhich by the way, I raised almost $6000 by myself with the food. And I spent some 200 hours of my own personal time for the month to make this stuff on top of my 50 hr a week job and 2 smalls kids. I am exhausted haha\n\n\nTL:DR. Little sister hates that I don't always make from scratch nor listen to her advice, then got butt hurt that my baked goods sold better than hers.",

For reasons that will become apparent I'm typing this with my non-dominant hand.\n\nA couple months ago my dad brought down a couple trees by his home. My parents live in an old farmhouse so he needs the wood for heating during the winter. Usually I help split it by hand but his year he decided to be sensible and rented a gas powered log splitter.\n\nIt was fantastic. 22 tons of hydraulic pressure tore even the largest and most knotted logs apart in seconds. What would normally be four weekends of work went by in six hours. \n\nWe were careful the entire time. One person grabs logs, the other loads it, and hands stay off the lever until everyone knows a clear. \n\nUntil the end. When we had five logs left we came across a log where half of it has grown perpendicular to the rest. There was no nice fork to aim the splitter at and the wood brought the blade to a dead stop every time we tried to split it. There were clear weak points I could see, but the log was large enough that it would overhang the edge and fall off the splitter if I tried to align those spots with the blade. But if I put a hand on the side of the log I could hold it steady while keeping it lined up. \n\nSo I did something dumb. Five logs before I could go eat and this was the only one that looked difficult. It'll be fine, right? Just hold it steady for a couple seconds, split the log, then go inside. Easy.\n\nNot easy. The log twisted the second the blade touched it, trapping my finger between the log and the steel strike plate at the back. Remember those 22 tons of pressure? Turns out that's a tiny bit more than a finger can take before crushing. I pulled the lever back immediately, but it was too late. \n\nFortunately only some of my finger got pulped completely. I'm at the hospital right now to see how much can be salvaged. Any related puns or nicknames you have for me while I wait (90 minutes and not triaged yet...) would be appreciated.\n\nTL;DR - tried to hold a log steady while splitting it and crushed my finger when it shifted",

What would normally be four weekends of work went by in six hours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were careful the entire time. One person grabs logs, the other loads it, and hands stay off the lever until everyone knows a clear. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until the end. When we had five logs left we came across a log where half of it has grown perpendicular to the rest. There was no nice fork to aim the splitter at and the wood brought the blade to a dead stop every time we tried to split it. There were clear weak points I could see, but the log was large enough that it would overhang the edge and fall off the splitter if I tried to align those spots with the blade. But if I put a hand on the side of the log I could hold it steady while keeping it lined up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I did something dumb. Five logs before I could go eat and this was the only one that looked difficult. It&amp;#39;ll be fine, right? Just hold it steady for a couple seconds, split the log, then go inside. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not easy. The log twisted the second the blade touched it, trapping my finger between the log and the steel strike plate at the back. Remember those 22 tons of pressure? Turns out that&amp;#39;s a tiny bit more than a finger can take before crushing. I pulled the lever back immediately, but it was too late. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately only some of my finger got pulped completely. I&amp;#39;m at the hospital right now to see how much can be salvaged. Any related puns or nicknames you have for me while I wait (90 minutes and not triaged yet...) would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - tried to hold a log steady while splitting it and crushed my finger when it shifted&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

But then when i get to the place my GPS was directing me, I realized i put in the WRONG ADDRESS! I was in the right city, but the place was a little more than 20 minutes away. I pull over at this point i am sobbing and my make up is a mess, I call my dad asking what to do, he says call them so I do.

I\u2019m crying even more at this point, I can\u2019t get in contact with anyone, I look like a mess, and the only point of showing up at this point is to make all the other candidates look better by comparison.

I pull over at this point i am sobbing and my make up is a mess, I call my dad asking what to do, he says call them so I do. I have to dig though handshake to find the number and when so do call it\u2019s the after hours machine. I\u2019m crying even more at this point, I can\u2019t get in contact with anyone, I look like a mess, and the only point of showing up at this point is to make all the other candidates look better by comparison. If i when I\u2019d be an hour late at least. I just went home.\nTLDR: Everything that could go wrong, went wrong, and I didn\u2019t even make it to my interview&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "Today started out fucking awesome. I was gonna help one of my greatest homies move back to our hometown. Let's call him C, I'll be accompanied by another buddy, J. J and I left town about noon and drove about 30 mins to the next town over where we found C hanging out with his gf's mom, she's gonna be T. She was driving a Uhaul for him. C had a pretty big distaste for his landlord/roommate which will become important later. I also got myself a red bull and brought no water, which will also become important later. T will stay in the car while us strapping young men take care of business.\n\nThings went very smoothly for us, C's landlord kept butting in but largely left us alone and C was admittedly kind of an asshole to him, which still has me pretty miffed because I think we could've solved what happened next in a civil way. C's landlord was very unhappy because my buddy didn't exactly give notice. We threw a bunch of bags in the trash can and this old man starts throwing a shit fit, he comes out ranting and raving in that righteous drunk old man rage and starts grabbing trash bags out of his trash can and throwing them into the Uhaul. He got one bag in there before I got up in his face and told him to stop being an asshole, I further explained that he could've asked us nicely and we would've taken the bags out of there. He fucked off continuing to rant and I grabbed those bags out of the trash can and set them on the curb for now.\n\nOnce we packed everything up, C had gotten everything from the house except some insulin. He started throwing the trash bags back i to the trash can, though J and I had already planned to just take it and toss it elsewhere. I guess C just really hated the landlord. T stepped out with us and J and I watched C start doing this. I immediately knew this old fucking man landlord was about to cause a scene so J and I head back to my car and I hoped things didn't escalate. Well, the old man comes out, starts throwing a fit, and they get into a tussle where I haul my happy ass over to them. T is yelling at them to break it up. By the time I get there, they had broken up but this old fuck goes back inside yelling about some crazy shit, I'm half expecting him to come back packing heat but thankfully he just calls the cops. Unfortunately, C has left his damn insulin inside.\n\nWe wait and the police arrive. C and J are hanging out in my car while I sit with T on the back of the Uhaul. The trash is and will remain in the landlord's trash can to be his problem. Right before police arrive, the old guy comes out to T and I and NOW starts trying to be nice to us. He offers us a voucher if we just take the trash to the dump. We tell him that we just want the insulin and we'll gtfo. A cop pulls up while he makes this proposition and he tells to the sheriff that he thinks we got it handled. I yell over him that no, Mr. officer I think you should stick around. As I walk around, low and behold I fucking know the sheriff, which may or may not have helped our case. \n\nThe sheriff is incredibly polite and pretty much takes C's side over the whole thing. He escorts C and the landlord inside and I didn't hear details but that trash was not coming with us and that insulin definitely was. Nobody was arrested and we left the place without further incident. J and I rode together and we were a little peeved at C for instigating but that old dude was definitely an asshole. I was just glad that it was over, and I was thirsty as fuck.\n\nI'm driving home and I start feeling a headache come on once we get into our hometown. I stop and get some water and we continue to the place C will be staying. Once we get there, I help unpack and start feeling real sick out of nowhere. My head and heart are pounding, I was pretty sure I had a migraine coming on. I was sweating like crazy and drank my whole water bottle. I stopped helping and sat down awhile. J gave me some ibuprofen. My buddies definitely could tell I wasn't doing so good and kept checking on me until I told them that I was just gonna head home and lie the fuck down. I am so glad I did, but I think I should've probably taken my happy ass to the hospital.\n\nI got home clutching my head and rushed inside. I vomited up that whole water bottle and all the ibuprofen before I stripped and sat and in the cool shower for like 40 minutes. My eyes especially felt really droopy and I was so, so, so very tired, if that makes sense. That headache might've saved my life because I absolutely could not sleep until it was gone. I suspect it was probably some good old heat exhaustion or heat stroke fever that had set in before I cooled myself down. After I got out of the shower, I lied in bed where my head continued to pound and I weirdly kept forgetting to breathe or was breathing real shallow so I kept kicking on deep, manual breaths until I managed to sip down a little water and 2 more ibuprofen. The head pain subsided, I could drink water if I was slow and laid down on my right side, and I took 2 more ibuprofen and finally felt well enough to fall asleep. I definitely should've gone to the doctor, the more I read the more I think I could've accidentally killed myself had I not cooled myself off ASAP. I woke up about an hour ago, my head is sore as fuck but I feel alright again and I think that today, I fucked up.\n\nTL;DR I helped my buddy move with no water on hand. I think I got heat exhaustion or stroke but somehow managed to treat myself with seemingly no permanent damage to myself.",

My first mistake was dropping the eldest off at school first, causing her to make a huge scene, \"because she wanted to be dropped off last\". Big drama. Tears, yelling, the works. Somehow get her sent to school and the other to kindergarten.\n\nDrive home to work remotely (pretty standard office work). Decide to play some dota 2 to blow off some steam, while attending our regular weekly meeting. It's a pretty basic meeting that is rarely relevant to my work, as it is basically our head manager relaying broad information from the whole company, but I attend in case something of relevance turns up. About 150 people usually attend. I sign in before the meeting starts, mute my webcam and microphone and queue up a game of dota.\n\nAs is the case with many video games, things get heated. After about 5 minutes, my lane partner starts flaming me, due to us not agreeing how to play the lane. So I say \"it's way too early to flame bro\" and keep playing. A couple of minutes pass and things are still going poorly. My teammate keeps flaming, and I just can't deal with more shit so I say \"whatever, muted\" and keep playing.\n\nAbout 30 seconds pass and I notice I'm getting pinged on Teams, Outlook and via texts on my phone. Six different people from different departements are telling me my mic is on and they can hear everything. Mortified, I check the video call. I muted my webcam and *the audio from the video call, instead of my own microphone*. I desperately sign out, sign back in and mute correctly. Apparently our head manager has been saying \"can whoever has their mic on please mute it\" a couple of times already. I thank the people giving me a heads up embarrassed but trying to shrug it off, finish the match while on the call and feel horrible the rest of the day, although not hearing anything else about it.\n\nAnyway, we still one the game, even though I played like shit, we lost all lanes, and we had no business winning it, lol.\n\nTL;DR I was arguing with a teammate in a video game, while unknowingly broadcasting to about 150 people in a video meeting.

    "selftext": "Hi, long time lurker here and this one is probably the most embarassing and just totally panic inducing thing I did in my teenage years so yeah it didn't actually happen today but a few years back. I had just started highschool and the school management was just basically non-existent. Chances of there being a garbage bin in the washroom were like 0.002% which is ridiculous considering it was an all girls school. So there was no proper place to dispose used pads and girls would just bring a garbage bag, put the used pad in it and then had to keep it in their school bags which was disgusting ofcourse. We had an empty pocket reserved for that purpose in our school bags. There was only one stall in the floor my classroom was and it was in the balcony area, thankfully the stall had three walls and a door that had a lock. But the sink was in the open, I hope you get the picture. And the school building was facing a two story complex which looked like a haunted house in a narrow lane. There was a big garbage container located right in the front of apartment complex and it's lid was broken so it was always half open.\n\nNow you might know where this is going. So I was on my period and had to change, normally I'd do what everyone did with the used pad which is wrap it in 3-4 layers, put in the garbage bag and into it's reserved pocket in the school bag. But I suddenly got this bright idea of aiming the garbage bag right into the garbage container on the street. And I was on 4th floor. This was the day I accepted that my aim is total shit when the garbage bag in which the pad was landed right at the edge of the roof of the complex. My heart jumped out of my chest the moment I realised what I have done and I started panicking. I went back to class and I was sweating profusely, told my friends what just happened and now all of us were panicking. We went back to check and see if by some miracle it fell down but no, it was still there, unmoved. One friend came up with the bright idea of throwing something else at it to make it fall down but we couldn't muster up the courage because teacher's office was right above.\n\nNow though I had never seen anyone on the roof ever before, I knew that a family with lots of kids lived there and well kids are curious and unpredictable. But this one curiosity could literally traumatize a kid. I imagined the parents suspecting the school because of obvious reasons and making a complaint, then the witch-hunt following it. Gosh, now everyone was panicking and making up scenarios so we took a BLOOD oath that we'd never open our mouths if ever questioned. And it became a daily routine to check on the poor garbage bag sitting on the roof. I had never wished for a thunderstorm so much before but that never happened. Then after 3 months of praying and hoping, it was gone one day, finally out of the sight. Saying I was relieved would be a huge understatement, we even went out for ice-cream to celebrate surviving that lol.\n\nTL;DR : Aimed a used pad at the garbage container, missed it and it landed on the roof of a complex where a family lived.",

I was sick for 2 days and just sat on the sofa bored and feeling terrible. I clicked on some fitness influencer to see a good exercise (I save good ones to do later myself) and she had a whole bunch of self promoting pictures from holidays and other typical influencer pictures. Scroll down, oh there's another girl showing off her glute progress, and the most effective way for that is to wear very little or shorts/leggings that enhance. Scroll down, and there's some girl with something else along those lines. \nWell, the highly intelligent algorithm decided to do it's job and change my feed from the usual fitness related material with some nerdy topics mixed through, to a page of semi-clad women in bikinis. Well, I refreshed my feed and there was something with a girl in something leather, and I clicked. Once again, the algorithm says \"Don't worry, I got you\". \nWash, rinse, repeat as I scrolled to my ultimate demise. \n\nMy wife, the highly observant woman that she is, noted that it's not like me to spend as much time just scrolling so she decided to open my Instagram and see what I was doing. Well, as you can imagine, that did not go well. It hit every nerve and trigger point which resulted in an argument that I have no defense for. \nTelling her that I love her, and that she's the only one for me and the only one I want falls on deaf ears because my Instagram feed indicates that there's something I'm lacking and looking for. She is justifiably so hurt by my stupidity, and on the verge of giving birth there's a chance she won't want me there to give comfort during labour if she's feeling so betrayed by me. \nSo, my huge f**k up is that scrolling pictures on Instagram will sour the birth of our child and I'm hating myself because I can't undo it. \nI feel so horrible. \n\nTLDR: My wife checked my phone and saw lots of semi naked girls on my Instagram feed and now hates me, right before our child is born.",

She let us hold her, she was head butting us, amazing. We looked at the board of kitty profiles and read that her name was Tiger and her description was great! Friendly, 2-4 yrs old, found on the streets with 3 kittens and ready for a forever home. We applied, on a Friday we got confirmed that we could take her home, amazing, scheduled to do so on Tuesday. \nI was walking around town with a couple of my friends that Saturday. The cafe has a big window where you can see all the cats, I suggested we go look at my girlie! The girl working the register told me where she was hanging out. I bring my friends to the window\u2026that\u2019s not Tiger? She got it wrong right? Whatever I met the kitty a week or so ago maybe my perception of her size or coloring was totally off. Oops. \nTuesday comes, we go in, cat carrier in tow, sign papers. Tiger walks over I say \u201cOh she can tell we\u2019re taking about her!\u201d I get up to pet her and the rep goes, \u201cOh that\u2019s Zebra.\u201d And brings Tiger over. That\u2019s..not who I thought we were getting?My partner and I look at each other and start a game of anxiety chicken or trying to communicate to one another \u201cI really want a cat, Tiger seems amazing let\u2019s still take her\u201d We leave and immediately confirm, that\u2019s not who we were expecting. \nSo we took the wrong cat home. Turns out that Zebra was not adoptable at the time we met her. My perception of her was not incorrect we just never confirmed that she was the kitty in the picture!!!\nWell I\u2019ve had Tiger home for a couple days and I can confirm that emotionally, I absolutely did not take the wrong cat home. She is my best friend and I am in love with her. I just want to spoil this beautiful baby forever! (I can tell that she was meant to me mine from the transition anxiety poops/farts, my anxiety manifests the same)\n\nTL;DR: I didn\u2019t confirm that the cat I saw in the profile was the cat I was petting; best fuck up ever. \n\nEdit to add that I posted a picture in the comments! I was unaware of the cat tax! ",

About 2 weeks ago my partner and I went to a cat cafe and had a great time with this sweet sweet kitty. She let us hold her, she was head butting us, amazing. We looked at the board of kitty profiles and read that her name was Tiger and her description was great! Friendly, 2-4 yrs old, found on the streets with 3 kittens and ready for a forever home. We applied, on a Friday we got confirmed that we could take her home, amazing, scheduled to do so on Tuesday. \nI was walking around town with a couple of my friends that Saturday. The cafe has a big window where you can see all the cats, I suggested we go look at my girlie! The girl working the register told me where she was hanging out. I bring my friends to the window\u2026that\u2019s not Tiger? She got it wrong right? Whatever I met the kitty a week or so ago maybe my perception of her size or coloring was totally off.

I then proceeded to give this person a code to my account (stupid ik, but that's what this post is for)\n\nAs soon as the red flags started to finally process in my head, I reached out individually to this bandmate via BAND to ask them if it was really them. That's when they confirmed that I'd been had. Before I knew it, I was booted out of my own Instagram account, the link to my Facebook account and phone number was undone, and for a whole 2-ish hours, my Instagram account was no longer mine.\n\nCue an autism meltdown. For those who don't know what a meltdown is like, it isn't fun. At least for me, my brain just starts spiraling out of control.

As soon as I got my account back, I immediately took precautions to hopefully prevent this whole debacle from happening again.\n\nHonestly, this is something that I wouldn't wish on anybody, and I'm so lucky that I managed to get my account back.

I already have a 12 year old daughter and 8 year old son so this is going to be my third kid. \n\nSince I work from home, I was home alone all day with my husband going to work and my kids going to school. During a morning work meeting, I felt like throwing up and just nauseous in general. This has been going on for a few days  now so I took a few tests and I learned I\u2019m pregnant. I was going to tell my husband as soon as he got home but my kids come home before him so I planned to keep it a secret from them until I\u2019m ready to tell them.\n\nA few hours after I took the test, my son came home then my daughter did an hour later. She went to my bathroom to borrow my moisturizer and she found my pregnancy test right on the counter. She ran downstairs holding the test and quickly asking me if it\u2019s true. My son overheard the whole thing and wanted my answer so bad. I told them it was true and my daughter started looking very stressed. She told me it was because she didn\u2019t want to look after a baby. I really get her because I had a sibling 13 years younger than me that me and my siblings spent most of our time looking after. \n\nI hugged both of them and told them it was going to me okay. I really didn\u2019t want my kids to find out before my husband came home, but it happened anyway.\n\nTL;DR: My kids found out I\u2019m pregnant from me leaving my test on the counter and they\u2019re worried about it now. Me and my husband are happy about this ourselves and have assured our kids that it\u2019ll be alright",

She lied to my mom and told her all sorts of false things about me. \nI don\u2019t know why but I never was able to let it go. I saw her manipulate people I love around me and just tried to get attention whenever someone in my family wanted to share their success. I had thought about cutting her off a few times but never did because my family invites her to events. (I also want to quickly add that she hangs out with the family from my mom\u2019s side, which isn\u2019t her biologically family. Also important to note that my mom became her stepmother when my sister was 2 years old.)\nSo yesterday I turned 19. And we had a small conversation via text. I was pretty cold towards her because I just didn\u2019t want to speak to her. \nAnd today she send me a long message where she told me she\u2019s done trying to stay in contact with me because she\u2019s the only one putting in effort.

You know the vibes.\n\nAnyway, this past weekend I attended a music festival. Between all the dancing, party favors, and other shenanigans, my body went through a lot. \n\nThis morning we had our usual intercourse (missionary mostly). Right after I blow my load on the sheets, I discover to my horror that there is blood everywhere in my nut. Immediately I think I\u2019m dying.\n\nI ask ChatGPT what this means, and it tells me this can happen from time to time, and usually means you bursted a blood vessel, which checks out given the music festival. Ok, so I\u2019m safe. HOWEVER, before that, I had taken a picture of the jizz just in case I needed to show a doctor. Safety first.\n\nFast forward to later in the day, I text my (female) coworker what I thought was a hilarious meme and put my phone down. My phone blows up immediately, and I discover to my horror I had just sent her my little mess instead. I tried to explain but she didn\u2019t take it well. I\u2019m worried she\u2019s going to take it to HR. \n\nTLDR; came blood, committed workplace harassment. Am I cooked?",

She doesn\u2019t believe in either birth control or abortions, so I\u2019ve been using the old withdrawal method. You know the vibes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this past weekend I attended a music festival. Between all the dancing, party favors, and other shenanigans, my body went through a lot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This morning we had our usual intercourse (missionary mostly). Right after I blow my load on the sheets, I discover to my horror that there is blood everywhere in my nut. Immediately I think I\u2019m dying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ask ChatGPT what this means, and it tells me this can happen from time to time, and usually means you bursted a blood vessel, which checks out given the music festival. Ok, so I\u2019m safe. HOWEVER, before that, I had taken a picture of the jizz just in case I needed to show a doctor. Safety first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to later in the day, I text my (female) coworker what I thought was a hilarious meme and put my phone down. My phone blows up immediately, and I discover to my horror I had just sent her my little mess instead. I tried to explain but she didn\u2019t take it well. I\u2019m worried she\u2019s going to take it to HR. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR; came blood, committed workplace harassment. Am I cooked?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "TIFU - the other day I was in a meeting with several coworkers discussing a project we are all involved in.  I struggle with one individual, Vikram, because he is rude to women in our meetings and I quite frankly I just don\u2019t like him.  I joined the meeting from my desk which is in an open office and not in the conference room, that was my first screw up.\n\nIn all of our past meetings he constantly talks over top of people and repeats himself, asking the same questions or making the same statements over and over.  During this meeting, he wouldn\u2019t stop talking over top of me and another coworker who were trying to explain what we were working on.  I had finally reached my limit and told him to stop talking so that we could finish our explanation.\n\nHe didn\u2019t stop, so I asked my female coworkers to leave the meeting then proceeded to chew him out.  I didn\u2019t raise my voice, but I was talking with what my kids would call my mean dad voice, which is low, firm and very direct.  Second screw up.  Like I said, I am in an open office.  I have people all around me.  My manager, \u201cVijay\u201d who is a director, and the manager above him, \u201cJoe\u201d who is an executive, are within 20\u2019 of my desk and overheard what I was saying.  I told Vikram to shut his mouth and open his ears while I explain the process.  He then yelled over top of me \u201cyou can\u2019t tell me to shut up\u201d and I proceeded by saying, \u201cI just did.  Now shut up and listen so I don\u2019t have to repeat myself again.\u201d\n\nSomewhere in the middle of my comments I said that he was acting like a child and if he wanted me to treat him like a toddler I would.  Third screw up.  After that comment he kept quiet, but I could see the door to Vijay\u2019s office close and Joe was in his office asking what the hell was going on with me.  I have worked with these two in various roles for many, many years and they know I don\u2019t ever talk like this to anyone.  I finished my explanation of the process we were developing and our current status, then asked if he had any questions.  Before allowing him to respond I said that if history was any indication I lost him about 3 sentences into my explanation, so I needed to know where I lost him.  He said he didn\u2019t have any questions and immediately left the meeting.\n\nVijay and Joe were still in Vijay\u2019s office with the door closed when I went to check on Annie, one of my female coworkers who had stayed in the meeting.  This guy has been known to back her into conference rooms and berate her about her part of the project.  She is more than half his age and a recent hire in our company.  By the time I got to her desk, Vikram came storming out of the conference room looking for Joe.  He pulled Joe into the conference room and proceeded to unload everything that had taken place.  As per his normal behavior he talked over top of Joe, I could hear most of what was being said.  He wasn\u2019t too terribly off on his story of what happened.\n\nI met with Vijay for my regular one on one later in the day.  He told me I was out of line and I should never have called Vikram a toddler.  He went on to say I should have joined the meeting in the conference room and going forward I am not allowed to join Vikram\u2019s meeting from my desk.  \n\nMy take away is that since I was in an open office and several people overheard me chewing Vikram out, that was the problem.  If I had been in a private conference room I wouldn\u2019t be in trouble.  I have been asked to apologize - a genuine apology.  The problem for me is I\u2019m not sorry for what I said or for how the message was delivered.  He had it coming for a long time.  Now, for the first time in my nearly 30 year career I have been put on an \u201cimprovement plan\u201d.  \n\nTL;DR I chewed out a coworker in a meeting while I was sitting in an open office and told him he was acting like a toddler.",

Even had some obscure similarities in food, movies and music. \n\nAt one point we were sharing our sense of humor and she hesitantly brought up dark humor. I am totally into that so I encouraged her to share a joke. The day we were having this phone call happened to be 9/11 so she hit me with a 9/11 joke. I thought it was pretty funny and we laughed together. We both agreed that jokes like this aren't meant to belittle the tragedy but rather share a bit of laughter and comfort around the subject.   \nShe then recommended I watch a stand up special by Daniel Sloss called Jigsaw. Great stand up, by the way, go watch it. The first ten minutes was basically talking about voluntary child abuse. \n\nThis is where I fucked up. Fast forward a week, things are still going great and I heard a pretty dark joke that I found funny. So I decided to send it over to her, thinking she was also into dark and messed up humor like I was. \n\nThe joke was: \"This guy went to a paraplegic strip club the other night. The place was crawling with pussy.\" \n\nWell, following that joke I didn't get a response for two days and then when I asked if it was too dark she just replied she didn't like it. What a glorious way to self-sabotage. Needless to say I think that's a lesson to keep dark jokes until much later in the dating process lmao. \n\nTL;DR Told a pretty fucked up joke to a girl I matched with on a dating app who said she liked dark humor (9/11 jokes) and then got ghosted",

But now I\u2019m sloshing, full of lemon juice, and my stomach was hurting. So I threw up, and it stung, oh my god it\u2019s so acidic. I think I mutated the acid in my stomach or something. It was absolutely delicious, but a terrible idea and I just thought I should warn people not to drink straight lemon juice. I also mixed it with a spoonful of salt, because I thought it might be tasty (it was). \n\nTLDR: I drank too much lemon juice and made myself throw up, it was yummy tho ",

But there was a BIG bottle of ReaLemon lemon juice, I guess my dad went to Costco recently, anyway, and I thought it would be tasty to drink a glass full. It was, so yummy, I genuinely enjoyed it. But now I\u2019m sloshing, full of lemon juice, and my stomach was hurting. So I threw up, and it stung, oh my god it\u2019s so acidic. I think I mutated the acid in my stomach or something. It was absolutely delicious, but a terrible idea and I just thought I should warn people not to drink straight lemon juice. I also mixed it with a spoonful of salt, because I thought it might be tasty (it was). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I drank too much lemon juice and made myself throw up, it was yummy tho &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "I heard some shady noises outside of my apartment;it\u2019s a pretty dark alley, so a car prowlers dream. So I go outside to have a look, and see a couple cars with their doors wide open. It\u2019s 2am mind you.  I\u2019m a bit of a shady character myself, so automatically I\u2019m out on the hunt for this son bitch. Do a quick lap around my parking lot and I don\u2019t see anyone, and as I\u2019m on my way back I see someone in all black across the street coming out of another dark alley full of cars. Right away I think that\u2019s the mofo. So I start stalking this person just to see if I can get some eyes on them, I get close enough where I could shine a light on them and can see it\u2019s a female.  However there was no reaction from her when I shined the light;head down and starting to walk a little faster. In my mind she\u2019s trying to avoid me. All of a sudden she ducks into a garage of a house and out of sight. So I go home and call the police to let them know there\u2019s someone out prowling cars.  The police show up and start looking around, I tell them what I saw.  Well they go looking into one of the vehicles and it looks like someone was rummaging around in it, they go into the other vehicle and low and behold there\u2019s 2 people sleeping in it. They wake them up and ask them what\u2019s going on.  Turns out their dog went missing earlier in the day, and they had the idea that if they left the doors open to their vehicles that the dog would hop in and wait for them. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f FML. So here they are getting woken up by the police at 2:30 in the morning, probably thinking the worst.  I couldn\u2019t believe what just transpired, felt like such an idiot, and so bad for the couple that lost their dog.  And after I came inside I started thinking about that poor girl that I was following, she must have been shitting her pants thinking I was going to kidnap her or something. Who even knows if that was her house or not and she was just seeking refuge.  MY GOD!! Talk about a double whammy.  I don\u2019t think the block watch jacket fits me quite well. \n\nTL;DR  I mistook someone that I thought was breaking into vehicles and 110% freaked the shit out of them, while at the same time scaring the shit out of a couple that just lost their dog.

So I go outside to have a look, and see a couple cars with their doors wide open. It\u2019s 2am mind you.  I\u2019m a bit of a shady character myself, so automatically I\u2019m out on the hunt for this son bitch. Do a quick lap around my parking lot and I don\u2019t see anyone, and as I\u2019m on my way back I see someone in all black across the street coming out of another dark alley full of cars. Right away I think that\u2019s the mofo. So I start stalking this person just to see if I can get some eyes on them, I get close enough where I could shine a light on them and can see it\u2019s a female.  However there was no reaction from her when I shined the light;head down and starting to walk a little faster. In my mind she\u2019s trying to avoid me. All of a sudden she ducks into a garage of a house and out of sight. So I go home and call the police to let them know there\u2019s someone out prowling cars.  The police show up and start looking around, I tell them what I saw.  Well they go looking into one of the vehicles and it looks like someone was rummaging around in it, they go into the other vehicle and low and behold there\u2019s 2 people sleeping in it. They wake them up and ask them what\u2019s going on.  Turns out their dog went missing earlier in the day, and they had the idea that if they left the doors open to their vehicles that the dog would hop in and wait for them. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f FML. So here they are getting woken up by the police at 2:30 in the morning, probably thinking the worst.  I couldn\u2019t believe what just transpired, felt like such an idiot, and so bad for the couple that lost their dog.  And after I came inside I started thinking about that poor girl that I was following, she must have been shitting her pants thinking I was going to kidnap her or something. Who even knows if that was her house or not and she was just seeking refuge.  MY GOD!! Talk about a double whammy.  I don\u2019t think the block watch jacket fits me quite well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR  I mistook someone that I thought was breaking into vehicles and 110% freaked the shit out of them, while at the same time scaring the shit out of a couple that just lost their dog. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I fell in love with Julian when i was a freshman, i am a junior in hs now. It will be 3 years since our relationship this december. He was tge first peraon that i loved and he was the first memory in my life that was healthy for a good 5 years. I really struggled with mental health issues when i was younger to tge point where i had become a psyche patient at only 10 years old. He always comforted me and i became codependant and didnt realize i even fell in love for the first time until a almost a year after the relationship when my sluislidal ideation and depression became more agressive around 4 months before our anniversary. \n\nNow to the past week. Julian and i have been talking more and we have finally gotten past the cusp of awkward exs and started becoming friends again around a month ago. This week specifically broke my heart... 4 days ago i get a tezt feom him which was a surprise since i normally reach out first so i immediatly responded. We began talking and it quickly became a non stop rush of questions, reminiscing, and random conversations for 3 days straight. We didnt talk for about 4 hours yesterday and he asked me if i had eaten, which made me tear up quite a bit cuz he only dis that when we dated.. anywho to tge dream last night. I  had trouble sleeping so i texted our mutual friend cole to talk to him about how he was and how julian and i, i think, are getting closer again but i wont have false hope. Cole continued to comment on how cute our conversations were and how he was happy to see julian and i getting closer again. I began to tear up and stopped answering as quickly which prompted cole to call me.out of concern i guess. I immediatly started sobbing and explain that i just want julian to love me like he used to which i knew was selfish and col conforted me through it and even said that i wont know until life shows me that were meant to be in the future. After a couple hours on the phone i fell asleep. This is where the problem starts. I had a dream about me and julian as an older couple with children and grandchildren around a christmas tree...i know this seems childish but the fact that i woke up crying made me realize that i have no idea what to do with myself....i was hoping the internet people couls thats why im writing this. I was in a different state for a school trip last night but that dream hurt me ao bad that i immediatly started driving 7 hours home and came home to talk to my mom. I sat there unable to even talk for about an hoyr before my mom spoke up. The second she spoke i broke down in sikent tears and asked my mom to hold me like i was 5 again. I havent cried tgat loud and hard since my childhood dog died last year in september.... i realize now that i either have to stop talking to him to geal myself but i cant...i mean i cant but...god i dont knoq what to do...can you talk some sense into me? \n\nEdit: we had a short conversation. I asked him the full reason as to why we broke up and all he could say other than his parents and me not knowing how to process love was \" i dont f***in know i forgot...drank and smoked it all away low key\"...ive been on read since i apologized...ig this TIFU has gotten worse.\n\nTL;DR TIFU by having a dream about my ex and realizing im falling in love with him again.\n",

    "selftext": "My (29F) boyfriend \"Alex\" (28M) have been together for 3 years and living together for over 2. We both agree on and plan to get married, but we want to be more financially stable first. We've never had a fight, just a few very calm disagreements and our communication is great 99.9% of the time. This is all to establish that as far as I can tell we have a very healthy relationship and I'm not totally crazy for doing this.\n\nI have a tendency to plan out things that I want to say in my head, but have a terrible memory, so I write them down. I'm also one of those people who always dreamed of getting married. I was single for a lot of my young adult life and had started to be convinced it would never happen. Then I met Alex and was absolutely blown away by happiness. I've never known love like this and we've weathered a few complex life events with no problems. My friends and family love him, his friends and family love me, aside from normal life chaos things are great. \n\nNow to the meat of the story.\nA month or so ago I couldn't sleep and my brain had already been in the mode of \"I wonder what our wedding would look like?\" (which isn't super common but happens). I then thought down the path of what I would say for vows. To be fair, I've been to a handful of weddings but never closely studied the vows so I'm not even 100% sure what I came up with will work, but my brain generated something that sounded like the perfect little speech before leading into the \"I promise to...\" Part. I'm not a writer and usually don't come up with things that pretty so I wrote it down in my notes app. \n\nFast forward to last night.\nAlex was at a concert with friends. I had plans to meet up with one of my best friends, \"Jess\". They're also in a happy long term relationship and have also been thinking about wedding stuff in general. While talking I without thinking said something along the lines of \"I even kind of started writing my vows so...\". They freaked out and of course wanted to read what I had, and I know they wouldn't tell Alex, so I showed them. Jess of course started crying saying they loved it. The conversation continued, I went home, and Alex got home from his concert too.\n\nHere's where I went wrong. \nI'm terrible with secrets and lies. Ever since I was a kid and had a lie bite me in the ass I just don't. I've found life to be better when open and honest. \nAlex is also friends with Jess and asked how our hangout was. I started to say \"great but I made them cry\" and cut myself after \"but I\" upon realizing what he would ask next and I don't want to lie to him. He obviously realized I had a secret and started playing 20 questions to find out what it was. Like I said I'm horrible with secrets and he managed to figure out that it's some sort of gift but that he won't get it for possibly years. It's worth noting that he HATES both gifts and surprises, they make him anxious, uncomfortable, and feeling indebted. This is when I knew I messed up, because once he knew something existed, I knew he would dwell on it indefinitely and it would bother him. Yes I could have lied and said it was something about Jess and their partner but I was also anxious at that point and picked the wrong cover up. \n\nAfter apologizing for knowing that I've created a train of thought that will bug him, and trying to convince him that he would be best off forgetting I said anything, we went to bed. He said he had a dream about solving a puzzle, and throughout the day has been texting me probing questions trying to figure it out. I am obviously not going to reveal any more, and I certainly won't be showing him what I wrote, but I feel bad that this will genuinely bother him for a while. \n\nAlso to anyone thinking \"just tell him something but don't reveal it all\", that might make things worse. We both fully plan to get married but it's not really on our radar anytime soon, and I know he has a lot of anxiety about \"not feeling enough like a grown adult\" especially when it comes to marriage. I should add that we both have stable careers and he is the most emotionally intelligent man I've ever met, so other than saving money and him feeling comfortable with the idea, I don't think there are actually any roadblocks. I'm in no rush whatsoever and will happily wait until he is as enthusiastic about it as I am. If I was to reveal that it had anything to do with our future vows it might make his anxiety worse. He doesn't mind talking about it, weddings are a common topic with many of our friends getting married, but it's not something he thought about prior to our relationship so discussing little details for our own wedding stresses him out a little, his brain just hasn't thought that far yet. I don't want to give him even the slightest idea that I'm trying to rush him, when in reality I'm just living the dream of my inner little girl thinking about her future wedding.\n\nTLDR:\nIn the midst of a happy long term relationship I randomly thought up part of what I might want to say for my vows at our eventual wedding. My boyfriend hates surprises, and I accidentally revealed that I have a secret after I showed what I wrote to a friend. He is now going to drive himself crazy trying to figure out what it is, which I obviously will not confirm even if he does figure it out. I feel guilty for giving him an unsolvable puzzle that he will dwell on ",

I don't think it's tourette's but I've never been tested for it. Anyway I've been reading online that some men feel more confident after manscaping their \"netherregions\". So I think you all see where this is going. Ive been shaving and trimming my beard with a beard trimmer that I also use to shave my head when my hair gets too long. I thought to myself \"well if it works for my hair and beard I don't see why it wouldn't work for what I've got going on 'down under'\". So I take a pair of trimming scissors I use for my beard and was being EXTREMELY careful when cutting the hair length down so it's easier to shave it off. After I was done I used my electric trimmer. Welp my body decided \"this seems like the perfect time to twitch\". And I ended up accidentally cutting my \"hotdog\". Thankfully i didn't hit a vein. But was left with a stinging pain. Needless to say I'm gonna buy the proper tools for the next time I decide to trim the hair downstairs. \n\nTL;DR I tried to shave around my groined area and ended up accidentally cutting my \"member\".

I also have a tendency to involuntary twitch. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s tourette&amp;#39;s but I&amp;#39;ve never been tested for it. Anyway I&amp;#39;ve been reading online that some men feel more confident after manscaping their &amp;quot;netherregions&amp;quot;. So I think you all see where this is going. Ive been shaving and trimming my beard with a beard trimmer that I also use to shave my head when my hair gets too long. I thought to myself &amp;quot;well if it works for my hair and beard I don&amp;#39;t see why it wouldn&amp;#39;t work for what I&amp;#39;ve got going on &amp;#39;down under&amp;#39;&amp;quot;. So I take a pair of trimming scissors I use for my beard and was being EXTREMELY careful when cutting the hair length down so it&amp;#39;s easier to shave it off. After I was done I used my electric trimmer. Welp my body decided &amp;quot;this seems like the perfect time to twitch&amp;quot;. And I ended up accidentally cutting my &amp;quot;hotdog&amp;quot;. Thankfully i didn&amp;#39;t hit a vein. But was left with a stinging pain. Needless to say I&amp;#39;m gonna buy the proper tools for the next time I decide to trim the hair downstairs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I tried to shave around my groined area and ended up accidentally cutting my &amp;quot;member&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "My mom and I were returning from a trip this past weekend and she had been coughing quite a bit during the 7 hour drives. She had just come back from a theme park the week before, so it was safe to assume she caught something out there.\n\nAs a precaution, I gave her a Covid test last night and found it was positive. At this point though, we had all been vaccinated and boosted at least 2 times each, so the next day, we masked up and went about our business. We\u2019re in the process of moving and the new house still needs a lot of work. I went to my job for a quick shift. \n\nMy throat was starting to become sore, but I figured that with a day off the next day, if I was to get any worse, I\u2019d have a whole day to be REALLY sick and could make the call if I couldn\u2019t come in afterwards. But aside from the sore throat, I was fine. I wore a tight mask and used my personal bottle of sanitizer more frequently.\n\nA customer tried to call in an order over the phone twice. The first time, my co-worker answered and transferred her to the kitchen. We\u2019re at the lull in our staffing, between the lunch rush and dinner rush, so servers were scarce. As a result, the call bounced back to the front where I answered. She explained that she wanted to place an order, come into the store to pay and then leave. No problem, my co-worker just forgot to radio the kitchen that there was a call on hold. I transfer her again and this time I tell the kitchen to answer.\n\nA few minutes pass and a lady walks in, masked up. Not an uncommon sight in my store, but still somewhat rare. She wants to place a to-go order with a server, explaining that she tried to call in twice, but was never answered. Great, it\u2019s the same lady. Our call-ins are supposed to go through a third party, but for some reason, some calls come through to us and transferring them to the kitchen is hit or miss. Frustrating, but again, no problem. I call up a server and her order finally gets taken.\n\nShe toils around the store for a bit, grabbing a few packs of jelly beans. Employee protocol calls for us to hand customers baskets to encourage them to shop more. I walk up to her with a hand basket and politely offer it to her. She thanks me and drops her candies in. I walk away to go back to my register duties.\n\nA few minutes later, she walks up to me and asks if I was okay. And this was where my fuck up happened. I have a bad habit of over sharing at work.

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom and I were returning from a trip this past weekend and she had been coughing quite a bit during the 7 hour drives. She had just come back from a theme park the week before, so it was safe to assume she caught something out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a precaution, I gave her a Covid test last night and found it was positive. At this point though, we had all been vaccinated and boosted at least 2 times each, so the next day, we masked up and went about our business. We\u2019re in the process of moving and the new house still needs a lot of work. I went to my job for a quick shift. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My throat was starting to become sore, but I figured that with a day off the next day, if I was to get any worse, I\u2019d have a whole day to be REALLY sick and could make the call if I couldn\u2019t come in afterwards. But aside from the sore throat, I was fine. I wore a tight mask and used my personal bottle of sanitizer more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A customer tried to call in an order over the phone twice. The first time, my co-worker answered and transferred her to the kitchen. We\u2019re at the lull in our staffing, between the lunch rush and dinner rush, so servers were scarce. As a result, the call bounced back to the front where I answered. She explained that she wanted to place an order, come into the store to pay and then leave. No problem, my co-worker just forgot to radio the kitchen that there was a call on hold. I transfer her again and this time I tell the kitchen to answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few minutes pass and a lady walks in, masked up. Not an uncommon sight in my store, but still somewhat rare. She wants to place a to-go order with a server, explaining that she tried to call in twice, but was never answered. Great, it\u2019s the same lady. Our call-ins are supposed to go through a third party, but for some reason, some calls come through to us and transferring them to the kitchen is hit or miss. Frustrating, but again, no problem. I call up a server and her order finally gets taken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She toils around the store for a bit, grabbing a few packs of jelly beans. Employee protocol calls for us to hand customers baskets to encourage them to shop more. I walk up to her with a hand basket and politely offer it to her. She thanks me and drops her candies in. I walk away to go back to my register duties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, she walks up to me and asks if I was okay. And this was where my fuck up happened. I have a bad habit of over sharing at work. Not gross out over sharing or secret-spilling, moreso familial gossip. Still no one\u2019s business. But in my head, Covid is no longer the Plague it used to be. You mask up, wash your hands frequently and only stay home if you\u2019re really sick.

    "selftext": "In order to truly express my FU I need to give some context.\n\nIn August 2022, I went into a coffee shop I've never been to which is where I met this girl. She works there as a barista and there is a bar top that pretty much faces their workstation. I sat at the bar top and she immediately starts conversing with me. I think she's just being kind but I enjoy our conversation. \n\nSince then, I have been going to this coffee shop every weekend and we always end up talking. Now, before people say I'm being creepy, I'd like to mention that after the first few weeks, I got a surprise follow request from her on Instagram. I did not give her my info although I'm not hard to find because I have a unique first name. Safe to say she enjoyed our conversations just as much as I did.\n\nAnyways, I found out early that she has a BF she is in a long distance relationship with. He works in a different state while she is still in school. Still, at this point even though I knew there was no chance at dating her, I still enjoyed our conversations. \n\nFast forward to April 2024. She has graduated college and quit working at the coffee shop. With that, I also stopped going. I never saw her or talked to her again. The only connection we had now was through Instagram where time to time she would like my stories and I would like hers but nothing more.\n\nAnother thing to note is that during the time I got to know her, she told me she did not want to live in the state her BF lives in and that she wants to stay in our current state. So I knew that when she graduates , either her BF would move back or they would break up.\n\nSo over the summer, every few weeks I would check her insta to see if she still had pics of her BF posted. Its now September 2024, I go to check her profile and no more BF pics.\n\nI'm excited and nervous. I'm thinking all week if I should just DM her and ask her out. Then, on Sunday Sept 15th, I GET A HINGE LIKE FROM HER.\n\nTo my own fault, I got overly excited. Not only was this a girl I was super into but the fact that it was someone I knew prior and IRL made this situation so much better. I can't remember the last time I went on a date with a girl that I didn't know anything about prior to hinge. \n\nIt's also worth noting that over the last couple years i've more or less given up on online dating. I just have not had any genuine connections and every first date feels like the same.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm just too excited. Already thinking about our future together. Too much of that, which is not something I ever really do.\n\nSo i match and message her on Monday. Say 'hey its been a while' , 'how are you' etc...she responds immediately and then follows up asking for my number so we can swtich to texting (wow she's really into me).\n\nShe texts me saying she wants to catch up and I ask if she wants to go out for drinks Friday night so we can catch up in person. She says yes.\n\nSo there are mixed opinions of what to do when date night is a few nights away. I try to do minimal messaging of 'hey how does 8pm her sound' one night then maybe the next day say 'hey just want to check if were still on for tomorrow'. I don't want to message too much because I want to have conversations in person.\n\nWell she messages me saying \"I know we're supposed to catch up Friday but I can't wait lol. I want to hear about your new job!\" (WOW she's really into me!)\n\nSo we are message pretty heavy back and forth. She is hearting all my messages. It feels like a true love story. Romance is in the air. My heart is beating, I'm smiling, I'm just so happy that this opportunity has come. I'm on cloud 9.\n\nThe Wednesday morning I woke up to a cold sore (FML FML). I immediately applied treatment. All day I'm applying treatment to minimize its visibility. Though i prevented it from getting huge, there are still blisters and its noticeable. Thursday is same case. I'm applying treatment all day, looking in the mirror every 20 minutes wondering if I need to re-schedule or if it'll get better. I really really did not want to cancel and just prayed it would be good enough by Friday. \n\nIts Friday morning. It's improved but still noticeable. Enough that i'm still checking myself out in the mirror every 20 minutes debating if I can see her like this. I'm really trying to hold out hoping its good.\n\nIts Friday at 3pm. 5 hours before date night. I realize too late that I can't be seen like this. It's probably more in my  head than realistically but I made the decision to text her asking to re-schedule. I wanted to be honest but cold sores are something I'm pretty self conscious about and I just felt scared that it would be a major turn off telling her that. So i told her I had a migraine and that I don't see it getting better anytime soon so I want to re-schedule. Ironically, it seems the real turn off was cancelling a few hours before. And looking back, migraine sounds like such a dumb excuse.\n\nShe doesn't respond on Friday.  \nSaturday morning I send a follow up text telling her how sorry I am. She immedieatly responds and says its no problem. These things happen. She says shes busy all weekend but that we can find time to reschedule again later. I ask if she's free weeknights and would like to meet Monday night. No response rest of Saturday. No response Sunday. Over the weekend i'm checking Hinge to see if she's made any changes to her profile(nope). On Monday no response. I check her Hinge profile again that night and she unmatched me. \n\nAt this point my heart has sunken. I feel like the universe dangled happiness in my face and pulled the rug out from under me. I feel like I've been kicked to the ground. I feel as if every bit of hope and happiness has escaped me. I haven't been able to sleep. I can't stop thinking about this. I'm constantly looking at my phone screen hoping to receive a text I will probably never receive. I am looking upwards to god every hour swearing at the top of my lungs at how un-fucking-believable this timing could have been. To finally get my opportunity for a date with her and a cold sore in the same week! FML! It is 100% my fault for getting too excited about this too early because the disappointment has crashed down so hard on me. I think its hurting because this girl knew me IRL. She was into me. I had already attracted her and then I fucking blew it up. To go from texting everyday to absolute silence. It fucking hurts.\n\nIt's Tuesday. I just sent her another message this morning asking how her weekend was but I think its over.\n\nTL;DR: Had a date planned with an amazing girl I've been into for over a year. Got blessed with a cold sore and had to cancel. Tried to reschedule and  haven't heard from her since.",

I was retroactively denied time off due to understandable circumstances, and my workload was about to triple, but I had it in writing that I was likely going to get the newly available supervisor role with this trial period went great. Massive pay bump too.\n\nWhat this meant was I wasn\u2019t going to be able to see my gaming cousins much, which was an absolute bummer, but I still had some evenings we could talk. At least, I thought that was going to be the case. Anytime I got home after work, they were in the spare room together gaming with each other on their Switches. I was able to join in on their LAN games, but they never once left the room unless it was for the bathroom or something.\n\nI never asked anyone why they kept to the room. It just didn\u2019t cross me. In my house, when the door is closed, they want privacy. Admittedly, I was a little disappointed, as I was under the understanding they were into board games and was hoping to play some Settlers or 7 Wonders with them. Since my brother moved out and my friends across the country, I\u2019ve been a bit starved for board gaming.\n\nThis went on for the whole week, the only time I saw them was when they went to the Bathroom we shared. (IMPORTANT)\n\nFriday at work was an extremely busy day trying to get everything done before the weekend. I was rushing between everyone making sure things kept going, and my adrenaline was extremely high. I didn\u2019t even register that anything was wrong until I got home that evening and absolutely crashed.\n\nI felt weak, dizzy, my strength absolutely sapped. As a result, I didn\u2019t even talk to my parents, I just called it an early night and went to bed.\n\nI was feeling absolutely horrible Saturday, fever, headache, upset stomach, and the water I took with my medication tasted like a Switch Gaming Cartridge. I was sick. I went downstairs to get something light to eat, and my dad pushed one of the COVID test kits into my hands. That's when the shoe dropped.\n\nThe reason why my cousins were not leaving the spare room was because they were quarantining themselves. They caught COVID from a wedding they went to five days before they came to visit, and no one bothered to inform me. Hell, I am kicking myself that I didn't realize it out sooner. Worst off, I was sharing a bathroom with them while my parents were using the downstairs bathroom. I didn\u2019t ask, no one told me. It just completely slipped my mind.\n\nOf course I had it and the next three days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) was hell on Earth. Despite having all my shots up to date to say it was the worst I felt ever would be an understatement. It could have been a lot worse, but today, Tuesday, I felt good enough to return to work with proper precautions in place to ensure it would not spread\u2026\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nRemember when I said that Friday I was rushing between everyone to make sure things kept running. This involved handling things, passing it to others, talking to others, and ensuring quality of prints. Where I live, COVID Regulations are not mandatory, it's basically \u201cUse common sense, if you have it, wear a mask, clean up your area, don\u2019t be an idiot.\u201d Now we can add \u201cDon\u2019t be an uninformed MORON\u201d to that list.\n\nIt started with two people calling in sick. Then, one by one my team started feeling sick and ill. Some were more resistant and able to continue working, but a lot just asked to leave early. Someone used one of the tests provided by the company, and yep, they have it. Not just them, but after they were confirmed the rest of the team took the test and everyone save for the one person I don\u2019t interact with caught it (and I don't think thats going to last long). Because the one person I don\u2019t interact with was the only one who didn\u2019t catch it, it was easily traced back to me as Patient Zero.\n\nMy boss said he is going to stick up for me, argueing their should be no disciplinary actions against me for being careless or not adhering to due diligence. I was genuinely uninformed, and the moment I learned I emailed my boss to do a wipe down of the facility, but it was too late. Right now I am sitting in an empty print shop, three quarters of my team missing, still have a headache, and brainstorming with my boss about how we are going to get out of this mess.\n\nRight now the only thing that has been set in stone is Face Masks and Hourly Wipe downs are coming back into effect, which the team is just going to absolutely love but won't help right now.\n\nI don\u2019t think I am going to get that Supervisor position. I am sure my direct boss will stand up and fight for me, but an entire facility shutting down from me, that\u2019s going to be hard to ignore.\n\ntl:dr Read the F'ing room.

Little did I know I put WAY too much (also the chili flakes were spicier than I thought they would be). And I\u2019m also dealing with a canker sore so that\u2019s fun lol. I have a high spice tolerance, but even I can get a little too confident about it.\n\nAnyway, I start to eat my pasta, and it tastes delicious but I can barely eat it because my mouth is on fire. Also it\u2019s 11pm at this point (I eat at weird times) so I\u2019ve ultimately decided to order in some late night McDonald\u2019s to curb my hunger. As for the pasta, I hate wasting food so I put the rest of it in the fridge and I\u2019ll try to eat the rest of it cold tomorrow and we\u2019ll see if that helps tone down the heat a little bit.

Little did I know I put WAY too much (also the chili flakes were spicier than I thought they would be). And I\u2019m also dealing with a canker sore so that\u2019s fun lol. I have a high spice tolerance, but even I can get a little too confident about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I start to eat my pasta, and it tastes delicious but I can barely eat it because my mouth is on fire. Also it\u2019s 11pm at this point (I eat at weird times) so I\u2019ve ultimately decided to order in some late night McDonald\u2019s to curb my hunger. As for the pasta, I hate wasting food so I put the rest of it in the fridge and I\u2019ll try to eat the rest of it cold tomorrow and we\u2019ll see if that helps tone down the heat a little bit. After all, I wanted some heat but not full on lava in my mouth \ud83e\udd23&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I put too many chili flakes in my pasta and now I regret it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "SORRY for a long post and ass formatting.  \n  \nI had my fresher night yesterday, and my friends and I were enjoying the vibe of the DJ; the room was closed, tiny (for 900 students), and quite hot with no air conditioning, due to which the floor was slippery as fuck; I was jumping and dancing like crazy, and in some moments my leg slipped inwards, and I had a crack sound in my ankles and knees (i crack my knees often so not a big issue for me, but the ankles scared the shit out of me because this type of shit had never happened to me before). I rushed outside the crowd (because of adrenaline) and fell as soon as I passed the crowd. A guy(fresher) helped me check both my legs out and brought my chair so I could sit properly with my legs well-rested; halfway through the checking, my friends also came to help me. They called the security guards so we could call for an ambulance to the medical center (I could not walk). We had to fucking wait for the ambulance for 20 mins while it was just inside my campus. Till then, I informed my father about it; he got worried and scolded me for dancing/jumping and said that I was too careless (but I told him to chill down a bit). When I was in the medical center, the doctor said it was just a sprain(both the ankles), but he would need to examine it tomorrow (that being today). I came back and told him everything; he then told my mom when I went to sleep (my mom resides in a different country). I slept a lot and missed one of the meds prescription that was given by the doctor the night before. \n\n\n\nNow, I woke up and called my mom. She started to yell at me that I had lost all of my schedule/discipline (a bit back context on it: The last whole week, I had a lot of quizzes and a butt load of assignments {for clubs and departments that I have joined or trying to join and was trying to squeeze out time my from sleep/classes for that}} and not maintaining a fucking proper schedule that I should follow. I told her I was trying to get a proper schedule, but the load was too much, and this went on for 20 minutes. She had to sleep, so she hung up.\n\n\n\nI went back to the medical center (the doctor told me to) and got my X-ray done from a hospital outside my campus. A minor fracture in the right ankle (it was written \"?undisplayed fibula fracture\"). The general doctor said tomorrow, the orthopedic will come and check on you to see if you require a plaster or not. I told my father everything; he was quite chill about it now (my mom was sleeping, so I was unable to talk with her).\n\n\n\nBack again, my mom woke up and started to scold me. She said, \"You've changed a lot since you went to university.\" Not talking with us as you used to (the amount of time), and to be honest, I am to be blamed here as I feel like she will scold me if I say, \"I am going somewhere inside the campus\" or \"Hanging out with my friends\" maybe I am being too judgemental and harsh (she doesn't do that normally), but I feel like I have already disappointed my parents a lot and don't want to disappoint more. \n\n\n\nI really want to catch up with my parents again.\n\n  \nTL;DR: I Broke my leg and got scolded by my mom on a different topic.",

I rushed outside the crowd (because of adrenaline) and fell as soon as I passed the crowd. A guy(fresher) helped me check both my legs out and brought my chair so I could sit properly with my legs well-rested; halfway through the checking, my friends also came to help me. They called the security guards so we could call for an ambulance to the medical center (I could not walk). We had to fucking wait for the ambulance for 20 mins while it was just inside my campus. Till then, I informed my father about it; he got worried and scolded me for dancing/jumping and said that I was too careless (but I told him to chill down a bit). When I was in the medical center, the doctor said it was just a sprain(both the ankles), but he would need to examine it tomorrow (that being today). I came back and told him everything; he then told my mom when I went to sleep (my mom resides in a different country). I slept a lot and missed one of the meds prescription that was given by the doctor the night before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I woke up and called my mom. She started to yell at me that I had lost all of my schedule/discipline (a bit back context on it: The last whole week, I had a lot of quizzes and a butt load of assignments {for clubs and departments that I have joined or trying to join and was trying to squeeze out time my from sleep/classes for that}} and not maintaining a fucking proper schedule that I should follow. I told her I was trying to get a proper schedule, but the load was too much, and this went on for 20 minutes. She had to sleep, so she hung up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went back to the medical center (the doctor told me to) and got my X-ray done from a hospital outside my campus. A minor fracture in the right ankle (it was written &amp;quot;?undisplayed fibula fracture&amp;quot;). The general doctor said tomorrow, the orthopedic will come and check on you to see if you require a plaster or not. I told my father everything; he was quite chill about it now (my mom was sleeping, so I was unable to talk with her).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back again, my mom woke up and started to scold me. She said, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve changed a lot since you went to university.&amp;quot; Not talking with us as you used to (the amount of time), and to be honest, I am to be blamed here as I feel like she will scold me if I say, &amp;quot;I am going somewhere inside the campus&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Hanging out with my friends&amp;quot; maybe I am being too judgemental and harsh (she doesn&amp;#39;t do that normally), but I feel like I have already disappointed my parents a lot and don&amp;#39;t want to disappoint more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really want to catch up with my parents again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I Broke my leg and got scolded by my mom on a different topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "My husband recently went to the doctor for routine blood work/checkup and the doctor suggested a magnesium supplement to help him get to sleep at night. I thought, great! We have magnesium, I've been taking it for years. Husband points out that the doctors specified magnesium glycinate. We have magnesium oxide. Didn't think much if it other than the doctor had mentioned less stomach upset with the glycinate. We promptly got busy and I forgot to order the supplement until last night. \n\nA little history, I've been taking magnesium since I was a teenager on and off. I have chronic anxiety. Back then, we called them my happy pills, and it's possible that they were actually the glycinate because they seemed to help my mood. But once I was out in my own I either didn't take them, or just went to the drug store and bought whatever supplement was available. Generally the Natures Best Magnesium, which as verified last night is magnesium oxide. I go through phases where I take it, and have taken it based on doctor's recommendation even, but I have never noticed any improvement in mood. This last go around, the only benefit I noticed was that if I took two it would clear up some constipation with some diarrhea.\n\nAs we were laying in bed last night, hubby asked if I ever ordered his magnesium and as I hadn't we went down the rabbit hole of trying to remember which specific magnesium we needed and I got curious, so googled the difference between oxide and glycinate. The first response was that oxide is used to treat things like constipation and glycinate is used for things like anxiety and sleep. Anxiety and sleep is what I've always been told, yet have not in almost two decades felt the result of.\n\nTwo decades of shitty sleep that led eventually to a sleep specialist that told me I'm perfectly fine. At least 15 years of trying to manage anxiety with various meds and doctor visits, weekly therapy, and finally most recently after a panic attack that put me in the ER, a psychiatrist. I'm not saying that taking the right supplement would have changed any of that, but I have spent the last two decades thinking magnesium just doesn't do anything for me. When it turns out I've been taking the wrong supplement the whole time. \n\nAnd as icing on the cake, as I went down my google rabbit hole last night, I ended up on a reddit thread what when I exited out of left me on my reddit home page on my phone, to be immediately informed that an iconic musician in our community was tragically killed in a horrible motorcycle accident. Something I would have learned eventually, but really didn't need to find out as I was trying to go to sleep. Just because I'd put my book down to google magnesium. \n\nTL:DR Googled the magnesium supplement my husband's doctor recommended only to learn I've been taking wrong type for decades, equalling no improvement in anxiety but an increase of diarrhea. Then as a result of the googling learned an iconic musician in our community died. Went to bed very sad. ",

Anyway, he used to reply to my stories and then we started chatting casually and  we have been talking online for a while. \n\nI really liked talking to him. He was funny, had a good taste in movies and films. Only issue was he didn\u2019t reply me on time and i confronted him once or twice about it but he explained that he is not much of a texter(?) but slowly he started changing this habit and used to reply me with 1-2 hrs. \n\nSo fast forward to today, we decided to meet and we did meet. We went to a bar, had couple of drinks. Yapped a lot. It was perfect. But then he casually told me that he is checking out some girl at the table. At first I was like \u201chaha yeah right as if she\u2019d choose you\u201d like in a fun frolicking way. Then he started checking out other girls randomly and he was telling all these to me. I was getting uncomfortable and sad cause i was literally sitting in front of him and all he could see was the other girls. \n\nI had a lot to drink and so i confronted him then and there like why would you check out other girls when you\u2019re out with me? So he was like why shouldn\u2019t I? If you want you can do the same too? I was like no why would I, I am literally here with you. My whole focus should be on you. It\u2019s a bit rude. So then he goes like what do you think this is? Do you think this is a date because I thought it was a simple meet and greet. \n\nNow here I knew that this might be platonic from his end but u was being delusional and thought no it might not. So I told him yeah I thought it was a date and I like you. I like talking  to you and I was looking forward to meet you.  Here he went completely cold and distant and he went like see i didn\u2019t realise this was the case for you cause from my end i have been very clear that it\u2019s a casual hangout for me. If i have some feelings for you later, i would tell you but now I don\u2019t but I really liked spending time with you and u would like to meet again. I asked him how do you want to hang out the next time we meet to that he replied casually only and not to expect anything else. \n\nThis went on and i returned home. We texted a little bit talking about the same thing and he was being completely honest about his feelings which I appreciate and I also agreed to be friends with him. \n\nBut today morning he has not replied to my texts. He\u2019s posting stories and everything. Completely ignoring me. I think I fucked up a perfectly good relationship by being dumb and I am so embarrassed.\n\nTL;DR I messed up a perfectly good relationship by misunderstanding the situation and now i can\u2019t stop spiralling  over it.

Now, I had to cancel and change one of the bookings. And I also had to do the same for my manager. And it was a very rushed day at work so I didn't double check the dates. This is where I screwed up - I mistakenly booked for Sep instead of Oct. And I didn't realise it until weeks after. \n\nWhen I realised, it was too late and the dates had passed, I couldn't cancel it. I was out 1k from my mistake. The mistake was compounded as I came in to work on Monday to realise I made the same mistake for my manager's booking, and she requested me to compensate her for her loss which amounted to 1.2k.\n\nNow I'm really depressed as I've essentially lost about half my monthly salary due to 1 stupid mistake in a wrong month entry. \n\nTL;DR: Booked wrong dates for hotel booking, lost 1k+ due to that. . Lost another 1.2k+ due to booking the same wrong dates for my manager. ",

I work from home, so our little unit is essentially a bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, and instead of a living room I have my workspace and the den in the big house is communal to all six of us so long as it\u2019s kept up with. \n\nIn the morning long before I wake up, my partner will leave post it notes around if they need something for me since they work the crappiest hours.  This is normally stuff like when to heat up the dinner already prepped so he can eat and pass out when he gets home or asking to grab something from the house he left in the den, etc. \n\nThis morning he asked me to clean the den up after him. Not the first time; we\u2019re all friends but some of us have different habits, work schedules, whatever so sometimes I wind up just doing it anyway cause I\u2019m home and wanna be in a clean space. When I walked into the den I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if I missed a party or something. \n\nI don\u2019t know who all was involved still, or what but when I saw the mess it looked like a group of freshly made pledges should be cleaning I just walked away. I made sure the big houses pets weren\u2019t able to get to the mess, then went out till about an hour ago (11 pm) after having my phone of DND for most of the day. I\u2019m used to cleaning bc I want to, not bc I have to. I\u2019m an adult, and so is everyone else so I hated thinking they could take advantage of me being the only one home all day. \n\n Here\u2019s the thing. I missed some post it notes in the den that my partner assumed I\u2019d see while I was cleaning. One of these was apparently  along the lines of \u201cwake (housemate) up, you don\u2019t have to do this all by yourself hes gonna do most of it!\u201d Which is great bc when he did eventually wake up w/o me getting him he just did it so it\u2019s not like everyone came back to ants or anything. \n\nHowever, some of them were more for just my partner and I. Like \u201ctake meat out of freezer, I\u2019ll be home early want wanna cook for us\u201d \u2026 or, y know, more importantly \u201cplease charge my arm, I wanna cook for us!\u201d\n\nYeah. So. My partner has (a few kinds of) prosthetic arms. He uses the bionic for more \u201cdelicate\u201d work but he\u2019s still not very used to it and loses things so 1) I keep track of the charger and 2) he needs help putting it on and taking it off. From what I\u2019ve gathered he got help from housemates to set the arm on and gather unfrozen meat to start cooking \u201cfor when I come home\u201d. Due to housemate cleaning the den before and not mentioning I wasn\u2019t around to help, no one knew that I was angry or when/where I went since I wasn\u2019t answering my phone. \n\nWell. The arm died when he was cooking, attaching him to the oven under the stove. He tried to continue cooking I guess, while also trying to undo the mechanic that locked the arm in place, and was shouting out the window to the main house hoping someone would hear him. I still don\u2019t have all the details but it was about half an hour until someone got to him and longer than that for them both to get the arm undone so he wasn\u2019t attached anymore. In the fight with it, he stumbled and burned his hand on the pan on the stove and left the arm hanging from the oven for me to fight with later. \n\nHe\u2019s upset so I\u2019m sleeping in my \u201cwork space\u201d to give him room. Our relationship isn\u2019t going to be ruined by this or anything and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll laugh about it eventually\u2026 but yeah foresight really is 20/20. \n\nTLDR; I left a messy house + ignored my phone when my partner was cooking my favorite meal in return for cleaning, but his robot arm shut down resulting in him being stuck to the oven for almost an hour and he got a minor burn on his good hand.

Of course he also tells me that I \u201cpunched him in the chest\u201d, I was definitely not at my air bnb, but in front of some high end house in a very nice neighborhood on the porch. How nice of my brain to basically shut down for the first part of me being maced in my face. As a result of all of this I began to yell in the face of the neighborhood watch, and in doing so spread the mace to all sorts of places on my body. In retrospect I could\u2019ve probably just ran considering the age and weight of this guy, and because technically he wasn\u2019t a police officer. So if you\u2019re familiar with LAPD, they are extremely slow to respond to any disturbance call.

    "selftext": "I'm posting this to get it off my chest about how disappointed I am with myself after messing up what I thought was a dream opportunity.\n\nFor the past few months, I've been going through an intense interview process for an Enterprise Architect position at Universal Studios. It was the 8th round of interviews, and I had already provided references, including at least two previous managers from my current company. Passing these references meant my current employer now knew I was looking for a new role.\n\nThe position was a perfect fit for me because I was already doing exactly what the job description outlined in my current role. The world around me was aligning in a way that made this experience feel like it was the role to have\u2014it was going to be the fresh start I was needing in life. Being involved with an industry that I could be proud to work for because it focuses on providing experiences and distractions to millions of people a year (yes, it's all about the money, but the people going to these parks are also trying to get away from life). It felt like a **shoe-in**\u2014everything the company was looking for was right there in my experience. Life events were happening around me that pointed me down this path, making it feel like the stars were aligning for this opportunity. During the interviews, they quizzed me on things I was already excelling at in my current role, which made me feel even more confident about landing the job.\n\nAfter the references, I was told I needed to have a 30-minute conversation with the CTO and a manager in HR. They couldn't schedule both in the same meeting, so I ended up having the meeting with the HR rep right as COVID was kicking in. The meeting with the HR rep went really well\u2014she was thrilled with me and even asked if I wanted a job in HR, which was both unexpected and flattering. However, shortly after, my COVID symptoms took a turn for the worst, and my body told me to stay in bed.\n\nWednesday was the big day: my final virtual interview with the CTO's direct report. Unfortunately, I was in the midst of my 3rd day of COVID symptoms. I had been bedridden for two days, feeling absolutely horrible, but I didn't want to let the opportunity slip away or disrespect their time. So, I decided to power through and attend the interview while still recovering.\n\nDuring the interview, I tried my best to put on a good face and answer the questions, but deep down, I knew I wasn't at my best. I did mention that I had COVID, hoping it would provide some context, but I fear that my performance didn't reflect my true capabilities and leadership skills because of how sick I was.\n\nA few days ago, I received an email from HR informing me that I wasn't selected for both the role I had originally applied for but also another position I wasn't even aware I was being considered for. It hit me hard because this was a dream opportunity, and I feel like I messed it up by not rescheduling the interview when I was so unwell.\n\nI'm now reaching out to the recruiter to see if there's any chance for reconsideration or another interview, but I'm unsure if that's even possible. This whole experience has been taking a toll on me mentally, feeling like I let myself and potentially the company down.\n\nI feel like I have let myself down and even though they say everything is fine, I feel like I have let my family down. The past couple of years have been a struggle for us as a family because we can't seem to figure out which direction we want to go in life. With all the things aligning, like they were, this seemed like the option that would finally be the path forward for us all... only to be pulled out from under us due to me not putting myself first. Now, I sit here, not able to mentally align myself towards anything, and the reality of the world around me, of the things that I was going to be able to get away from or not have to deal with by going down this path, are starting to overwhelm me more.\n\nLooking back, I should have prioritized my health and communicated better about needing to reschedule. Instead, I tried to tough it out and paid the price.\n\n  \n**TL;DR:** I regret not prioritizing my health and letting my illness affect this dream opportunity. I went through 8 rounds of interviews for an Enterprise Architect position at Universal Studios, which perfectly matched my current role. During my final interview with the CTO\u2019s direct report on Wednesday, I was seriously ill with COVID-19 but didn\u2019t reschedule. My poor performance led to rejection from both the role I applied for and another position I wasn\u2019t aware of. ",

It was the 8th round of interviews, and I had already provided references, including at least two previous managers from my current company. Passing these references meant my current employer now knew I was looking for a new role.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The position was a perfect fit for me because I was already doing exactly what the job description outlined in my current role. The world around me was aligning in a way that made this experience feel like it was the role to have\u2014it was going to be the fresh start I was needing in life. Being involved with an industry that I could be proud to work for because it focuses on providing experiences and distractions to millions of people a year (yes, it&amp;#39;s all about the money, but the people going to these parks are also trying to get away from life). It felt like a &lt;strong&gt;shoe-in&lt;/strong&gt;\u2014everything the company was looking for was right there in my experience. Life events were happening around me that pointed me down this path, making it feel like the stars were aligning for this opportunity. During the interviews, they quizzed me on things I was already excelling at in my current role, which made me feel even more confident about landing the job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the references, I was told I needed to have a 30-minute conversation with the CTO and a manager in HR. They couldn&amp;#39;t schedule both in the same meeting, so I ended up having the meeting with the HR rep right as COVID was kicking in. The meeting with the HR rep went really well\u2014she was thrilled with me and even asked if I wanted a job in HR, which was both unexpected and flattering. However, shortly after, my COVID symptoms took a turn for the worst, and my body told me to stay in bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wednesday was the big day: my final virtual interview with the CTO&amp;#39;s direct report. Unfortunately, I was in the midst of my 3rd day of COVID symptoms. I had been bedridden for two days, feeling absolutely horrible, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to let the opportunity slip away or disrespect their time. So, I decided to power through and attend the interview while still recovering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the interview, I tried my best to put on a good face and answer the questions, but deep down, I knew I wasn&amp;#39;t at my best. I did mention that I had COVID, hoping it would provide some context, but I fear that my performance didn&amp;#39;t reflect my true capabilities and leadership skills because of how sick I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I received an email from HR informing me that I wasn&amp;#39;t selected for both the role I had originally applied for but also another position I wasn&amp;#39;t even aware I was being considered for. It hit me hard because this was a dream opportunity, and I feel like I messed it up by not rescheduling the interview when I was so unwell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m now reaching out to the recruiter to see if there&amp;#39;s any chance for reconsideration or another interview, but I&amp;#39;m unsure if that&amp;#39;s even possible. This whole experience has been taking a toll on me mentally, feeling like I let myself and potentially the company down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I have let myself down and even though they say everything is fine, I feel like I have let my family down. The past couple of years have been a struggle for us as a family because we can&amp;#39;t seem to figure out which direction we want to go in life. With all the things aligning, like they were, this seemed like the option that would finally be the path forward for us all... only to be pulled out from under us due to me not putting myself first. Now, I sit here, not able to mentally align myself towards anything, and the reality of the world around me, of the things that I was going to be able to get away from or not have to deal with by going down this path, are starting to overwhelm me more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I should have prioritized my health and communicated better about needing to reschedule. Instead, I tried to tough it out and paid the price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; I regret not prioritizing my health and letting my illness affect this dream opportunity. I went through 8 rounds of interviews for an Enterprise Architect position at Universal Studios, which perfectly matched my current role. During my final interview with the CTO\u2019s direct report on Wednesday, I was seriously ill with COVID-19 but didn\u2019t reschedule. My poor performance led to rejection from both the role I applied for and another position I wasn\u2019t aware of. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I\u2019ve always been super careful with who I\u2019m messaging, but today I managed to make the mother of all mistakes.\n\nI have a friend who also works in the same company, and we\u2019ve been passing the time by sending each other funny GIFs throughout the day to keep our spirits up. You know the ones \u2014 ridiculous, sometimes a little inappropriate, but all in good fun.\n\nAnyway, I was in the middle of a boring workday when I came across *the* perfect GIF for my friend. It was this clip of a cat slapping another cat while the words \"Shut the F\\*\\*\\* Up\" flashed across the screen. A little aggressive, but hilarious in context (we\u2019d just been talking about how annoying someone in the office was being).\n\nI clicked on the GIF, hit send, and immediately continued with my work like nothing had happened. A few minutes later, I saw a notification pop up. My stomach dropped. It wasn\u2019t my friend who replied. It was my BOSS.\n\nTurns out, I didn\u2019t send the cat slap GIF to my friend. I sent it to my boss. And not just any boss\u2014*the* boss. The CEO of the company. The guy who literally signs my paycheck.\n\nCue full-on panic mode.\n\nI quickly opened the message thread and there it was: the aggressive cat slap GIF, sent directly to the CEO with absolutely zero context. No \u201cHey, sorry, wrong message!\u201d or \u201cThis was meant for someone else!\u201d Just a GIF of a cat telling the CEO to shut the f\\*\\*\\* up. I was horrified.\n\nMy immediate instinct was to try and fix it. I started typing out an apology, but then stopped. *What the hell do I even say?!*\n\n\"Uh, sorry for telling you to shut up with a violent cat, Mr. CEO?

    "selftext": "So I was dating my then girlfriend at the time for about 10 months. We'd obviously been talking for a little longer than that. From the beginning of our relationship we basically lived together on the weekends. Spending the night at each other's houses from Friday night until Sunday night. We'd also see each other Thursday nights and text every night. The last month of our relationship was a little shaky.\n\nShe'd been looking another job for a while and I was trying to help her in her search. I actually found her the program that she's currently enrolled in. We'd also talk about it over text every night.\n\nSo one Saturday we went out with a friend and came back and I played some video games. This was only the second time I played my Xbox in front of her. After a while she got upset and said that I love the game more than her. I didn't really take that comment seriously because I'd tell her I love her every day but I stopped and hugged her but she said it was too late. She said she was stressed about her job related stuff and after I saw her get really upset I just turned it off but she was crying and decided to sleep in another room. At some point she came back in the room and the next morning was awkward. I didn't even know how to react to her because I was surprised she got that upset. She ended up storming out of my house and said that I wasn't there for her.\n\nAfter she left I found out she texted her ex as soon as she got home. I never brought this up and I don't think it would've made things better if I did. I texted her to see if she was alright and I apologized and said I was here for her. Admittedly I didn't think I was the bad guy and did anything that egregious but I just told her sometimes I like doing my own thing but I still loved her.

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I was dating my then girlfriend at the time for about 10 months. We&amp;#39;d obviously been talking for a little longer than that. From the beginning of our relationship we basically lived together on the weekends. Spending the night at each other&amp;#39;s houses from Friday night until Sunday night. We&amp;#39;d also see each other Thursday nights and text every night. The last month of our relationship was a little shaky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;d been looking another job for a while and I was trying to help her in her search. I actually found her the program that she&amp;#39;s currently enrolled in. We&amp;#39;d also talk about it over text every night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So one Saturday we went out with a friend and came back and I played some video games. This was only the second time I played my Xbox in front of her. After a while she got upset and said that I love the game more than her. I didn&amp;#39;t really take that comment seriously because I&amp;#39;d tell her I love her every day but I stopped and hugged her but she said it was too late. She said she was stressed about her job related stuff and after I saw her get really upset I just turned it off but she was crying and decided to sleep in another room. At some point she came back in the room and the next morning was awkward. I didn&amp;#39;t even know how to react to her because I was surprised she got that upset. She ended up storming out of my house and said that I wasn&amp;#39;t there for her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After she left I found out she texted her ex as soon as she got home. I never brought this up and I don&amp;#39;t think it would&amp;#39;ve made things better if I did. I texted her to see if she was alright and I apologized and said I was here for her. Admittedly I didn&amp;#39;t think I was the bad guy and did anything that egregious but I just told her sometimes I like doing my own thing but I still loved her. I never played video games in front of her again. We still spent the remaining weekends together in their entirety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt bad because I made her upset. I just wanted to have fun on the Xbox for a little while after a long week and a night out. I apologized and never played video games in front of her again. But that was when she started talking to her ex and now she&amp;#39;s going back to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR My girlfriend texted her ex after getting upset with me&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Used it for a couple days. Did a post, followed some accounts, and then proceeded to ingore it ever-after. Here is where the fuck up was planted.\n\nAmongst the brand new (at the time) Thread accounts I was following, I followed a bunch of content creators associated with Rooster Teeth. This included all the big names; Gavin, Geoff, Jack, Blaine etc.... and some of their partners that show up in content and voice actor/actresses on their shows. This is was the fuck up. \n\nI followed some ladies, such as Meg Turney, Jessica Nigri, and Lindsay Jones.\n\nI know they cosplay, but I'm not a big fan of that side of theor content. I recognise they do it well and move on if I ever see it, which is rare nowadays as I use social media very little. Never use instagram or X, only use facebook for messenger with older family, and i avoid tiktok like the plague.\n\nWell... With the seed planted, lets fast forward to tonight. I'm in bed next to my wife and while glancing over at my phone, a notification pops up. \"You have 1 new follower\". Its probably a bot, i swipe away the banner, but my wife gets curious. She wants to know who followed me. I say its probably a bot or nobody, who cares. She then gives me look and says aloud that she thinks I'm being dismissive too quickly. She has a lot of axieity and gets suspecious.\n\nSo she insists on looking and i relent. She opens the app and looks at the notifications. Its a nobody. But she then decides to have a look at the home page feed. One scroll down and she sees a Jessica Nigri cosplay post.\n\nAll hell breaks loose.\n\nShe immediately explodes and accuses me of cheating on her by looking near-naked cosplay models online. In her anger, she starts looking for more. Into my followers list. I'm a bit flustered because I had forgotten about who I followed on threads and can't answer when she screams at me asking why I follow 'naked' girls online. She find another ex-Rooster Teeth employee who posts cosplay pics. \n\nNow she explodes a second time and she thinks i'm a serial cheater, screaming i'm a dirty liar and a pervert.\n\nIt's a full on meltdown and no matter what I say, it doesn't get through. The way she expresses what she thinks at the moment makes it sound like I am actively going online to look up these women and self-pleasure myself to them. (A complete fabrication in her own mind). She claims that I must not love her and that she not enough to satisfy my 'needs', which is also not true at all. I love her. With my whole heart. It's killing me how upset she is.\n\nI try to explain to her that everything she is saying is not true and that I love her. Nothing gets through. \n\nNow i'm locked out of the bedroom. I can hear her crying and it breaks my heart. I'm afraid she might hurt herself, as she has gotten dangerously close to it in the past. Depression during covid-lockdowns hit her very hard. My axieity levels are through the roof right now.\n\nTl;dr Used Threads when it came out (and only then). Followed some ex-rooster teeth creators that are female cosplayers. Wife saw it by accident a year later (today). I'm now accused of being a cheater.",

So this is me experiencing jet lag and I\u2019m also seeing her for the first time in person. Does this make things better? Probably not, maybe makes it worse actually.\nShe turns to me, almost nonchalantly as if she has already had this conversation with me before and could guess every word I\u2019m about to say.\n# \u201cWould you still love me if I was a worm?\u201d\nAnd I failed. In my defense we had just woken up and I was still a little sleepy. But I turn my dumb, DUMB head towards her and say probably the single worst thing I could have said.\n*\u201cNo. How would that even work.\u201d*\nCue the utter look of disappointment. I\u2019m talking big, puppy eyes. Shoving her lower lip forwards. Pushing up her nose slightly. I pretty much got the whole \u201cyou fucked up\u201d package delivered to my face. \nShe says \u201cyou could keep me in a little jar with dirt and leaves\u201d and this is the moment a smart boyfriend realizes that this question has nothing to do with logic but instead is more of a \u201cwould you love me no matter what\u201d question with a cute and funny twist.\nAnd like the moron that I am I **double down and say the second worst thing I could have said**\n*\u201dBut how do I like- love you? I can\u2019t really like kiss you anymore or talk to you really.\u201d*\n\nBoys. Gals. Everything in between and off the spectrum. If your partner asks you if you\u2019d still love them if they were a worm, just say yes. The look of \u201cwell I\u2019m upset now\u201d doesn\u2019t make the victory in that discussion worth it. In my head I thought the two of us were on even terms there. In her head- I simply should have said yes and moved on. \nLuckily I quickly defused the situation by looking up how to hold worms as pets. One of the tips was that \u201cworms need to wiggle\u201d so I wrapped her in a blanket and shook her a little while making a dumb noise. That made her so happy and giddy that all was right in the world again but she did immediately tell her best friend who slid into my DMs to call me a dumbass and ask why I didn\u2019t just say yes. She has reminded me several times of what I have said already and I get the feeling that she will not let me live this down anymore. Luckily she\u2019s very easily distracted and I get her giggly with the \u201cworms need to wiggle\u201d but even as I\u2019m typing this I\u2019m wondering what in the world I was thinking. \n\nTL;DR Igot asked if I would still love my girlfriend if she was a worm and said no. Don\u2019t do that.\n\nEdit: Some of y\u2019all worry me a little. This was a silly thing, not even that serious of a post but funny enough to write about. But I have to say: if your first impulse upon hearing a silly question is to either insult your partner or make fun of them, you will probably end up writing an AITA/TIFU faster than you\u2019d think.",

If your partner asks you if you\u2019d still love them if they were a worm, just say yes. The look of \u201cwell I\u2019m upset now\u201d doesn\u2019t make the victory in that discussion worth it. In my head I thought the two of us were on even terms there. In her head- I simply should have said yes and moved on. \nLuckily I quickly defused the situation by looking up how to hold worms as pets. One of the tips was that \u201cworms need to wiggle\u201d so I wrapped her in a blanket and shook her a little while making a dumb noise. That made her so happy and giddy that all was right in the world again but she did immediately tell her best friend who slid into my DMs to call me a dumbass and ask why I didn\u2019t just say yes. She has reminded me several times of what I have said already and I get the feeling that she will not let me live this down anymore. Luckily she\u2019s very easily distracted and I get her giggly with the \u201cworms need to wiggle\u201d but even as I\u2019m typing this I\u2019m wondering what in the world I was thinking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Igot asked if I would still love my girlfriend if she was a worm and said no. Don\u2019t do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Some of y\u2019all worry me a little. This was a silly thing, not even that serious of a post but funny enough to write about. But I have to say: if your first impulse upon hearing a silly question is to either insult your partner or make fun of them, you will probably end up writing an AITA/TIFU faster than you\u2019d think.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I'm supposed to learn new software, called \"Confusion\" for this story. Confusion is a really complex hard to learn software with a thousand buttons, commands, and hundreds of features I'll never touch. Training was scheduled for 8:00 a.m Thursday on Teams with a few other writers in the company who were learning it too.\n\nMy day normally starts at 830. Two Thursdays ago I forgot about the start time and logged in at 830 only to discover training had started already. Immediately I was lost. Then my laptop wouldn't connect to the servers, so I couldn't even use the Confusion software. So the instructor said to follow along and the issues would be corrected the next day.\n\nAfter staring at this \"training seminar\" for a while, completely lost, i started to do my regular work since I'm facing deadlines, and tuned out the seminar. Mercifully it ended at noon.\n\nThe next day the connection issues were fixed so I could train.\n\nThe next Thursday I was ready at 8:00, but my laptop wasn't. It took over ten minutes for my laptop to boot up, so by the time I was ready, they were already training. Immediately I was lost. My software worked, but I had no idea what was going on.\n\nAfter staring at the screen for a million minutes, I wondered how I would learn Confusion since this training seminar was a huge waste of my time. I started looking online for tutorials but couldn't find one.\n\n Then I noticed the instructor kept referring to a pdf with instructions on it. I wondered where to get that pdf since it was something I evidently needed. So I hunted through my emails and found a link to documentation for the training seminar.  And THERE was the mystery pdf along  with other critical documents I didn't know about.\n\nNow ignoring the seminar, I started reading the pdf and found step by step instructions on how to do each thing the instructor had been demonstrating. \n\nI spent the rest of the time on Step 1 trying to learn the software myself. After working with it for a while, I started understanding the basics. \n\nThe other students were pretty much done and asking questions and sharing their screens with the instructor and asking for clarification. Meanwhile I was still diddling around with the first steps. No way I was sharing my screen or progress since I didn't want them to know what a complete dumbass I was the whole time. I never even turned on my camera or mic.\n\nEverything would have been explained in that first Thursday morning that I missed. I would have known about the pdf and training materials. I could have learned Confusion in the traing seminars, but didn't. Now I'm behind and have to learn it myself 'cause I'm a dumbass.\n\nTLDR: Missed an important meeting time so I screwed myself on training on new software. ",

I just wanted to add, yes I need to apologize and I will, and I also want to say I had no intentions of misgendering her I was just repeating what my friends mom had said and I don\u2019t think she meant it out of malice but context as I\u2019ve only known of the fiance as her previous gender, hope this clears things up!",

I just wanted to add, yes I need to apologize and I will, and I also want to say I had no intentions of misgendering her I was just repeating what my friends mom had said and I don\u2019t think she meant it out of malice but context as I\u2019ve only known of the fiance as her previous gender, hope this clears things up!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

In hindsight this was a horrible idea I know but at the time it seemed so funny that I wasn't thinking of the consequences.\n\nSo you could probably guess what happened next: I walked into their square, got my water bottle, and casually poured some water in my mouth as if my friends didn't exist. That's when I realised my FU: I couldn't stop myself from laughing and I still had a mouthful of water. I ended up spitting out most of the water but some of it came out of my nose. I was coughing so bad my friends looked at me like I was dying.\n\nFast forward to last week: I haven't seen these particular friends for a while and saw them again that day. Talked for a while, then they got up and started playing handball. Now I don't know what I was thinking, but I decided to do the same joke again. Yep, the joke which ended up with me choking on water. I suppose I thought that I would be able to control my laughter this time. Spoilers, I couldn't and the exact same thing happened again: water coming out of my nose, uncontrollable coughing. \n\n  \nYeah funny and drinking water don't mix.

    "selftext": "A few years ago, I agreed to meet up an OfferUp seller to buy a bicycle for $200. there were multiple red flags that I consciously acknowledged but chose to ignore.\n\nThe seller already had the bicycle posted for a decent price but I figured why not shoot an offer and try to get a better deal, worst they could say was no, or so I thought. the seller agreed to the offer and we scheduled to meet a few hours later that day. \n\nthe city of the meet up location was the first red flag. definitely not the safest city and I would see a reason why. but I proceed to head over to the park for the meet. as soon as I get off the freeway, I notice that this area does not look like the best part of this already unsafe city. I continue on. \n\nI pull up to the park and see multiple families and think this shouldn't be too bad, there's several people around so I message the seller and he tells me to meet him near the bathrooms at the back end of the parking lot. okay, on my way!\n\nI move my car to the designated, much more secluded meeting area where I see three guys, probably in their mid to late teens, with the bike I'm there to buy. oooo I want it. \n\nI attempt to greet the three fine young gentlemen holding onto my soon to be ride but there was no response so I ask if I could check out the bike to which one of them actually speaks and says yes. \n\nafter a quick look over, I tell the non-mute young buck that I'll take the bike and give him the cash. instead of letting go of the bike and handing it over to me, the one holding the bike says he'll help me load it in my car. sure, I'm right over here. \n\nas we start walking the 15 feet to my car, the three youngsters turn in the wrong direction. I try to say hey my cars right here but they keep walking so I say hey where yall goin?? \n\nthe response was definitely not what I anticipated but looking back, I know I put myself in the situation. \n\none of these bad boys turns around and lifts his shirt just enough to reveal the handle of a handgun in his waistband. definitely not worth it and i was not going to FAFO if it was actually real or not. I immediately stop and watch as they duck through a hole in the chain link fence and down into the wash with my bike and my $200.\n\nI call my girlfriend, fuming and tell her what happened. she asks if I had called the cops. that's probably a good idea....\n\ngiven the unsavory nature of this city and the mention of a gun or maybe it was a slow day, the local police showed up within 10 minutes and I see/hear a helicopter overhead. I tell them my story and they say that criminals in the area prey on folks from out of town, although I graduated college in the same city so I was familiar lol. the officer gives me a police report number and tells me a detective would be in contact. never heard anything after that day. the officer also suggested meeting at a bank where there are cameras or at the police station. they have designated rooms to conduct that type of business. also preferably do not go alone. \n\nTL;DR went to buy a bicycle for $200 from an OfferUp seller. after seeing a gun, went home without the bike or the cash.

I continue on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pull up to the park and see multiple families and think this shouldn&amp;#39;t be too bad, there&amp;#39;s several people around so I message the seller and he tells me to meet him near the bathrooms at the back end of the parking lot. okay, on my way!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I move my car to the designated, much more secluded meeting area where I see three guys, probably in their mid to late teens, with the bike I&amp;#39;m there to buy. oooo I want it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I attempt to greet the three fine young gentlemen holding onto my soon to be ride but there was no response so I ask if I could check out the bike to which one of them actually speaks and says yes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;after a quick look over, I tell the non-mute young buck that I&amp;#39;ll take the bike and give him the cash. instead of letting go of the bike and handing it over to me, the one holding the bike says he&amp;#39;ll help me load it in my car. sure, I&amp;#39;m right over here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;as we start walking the 15 feet to my car, the three youngsters turn in the wrong direction. I try to say hey my cars right here but they keep walking so I say hey where yall goin?? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the response was definitely not what I anticipated but looking back, I know I put myself in the situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;one of these bad boys turns around and lifts his shirt just enough to reveal the handle of a handgun in his waistband. definitely not worth it and i was not going to FAFO if it was actually real or not. I immediately stop and watch as they duck through a hole in the chain link fence and down into the wash with my bike and my $200.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I call my girlfriend, fuming and tell her what happened. she asks if I had called the cops. that&amp;#39;s probably a good idea....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;given the unsavory nature of this city and the mention of a gun or maybe it was a slow day, the local police showed up within 10 minutes and I see/hear a helicopter overhead. I tell them my story and they say that criminals in the area prey on folks from out of town, although I graduated college in the same city so I was familiar lol. the officer gives me a police report number and tells me a detective would be in contact. never heard anything after that day. the officer also suggested meeting at a bank where there are cameras or at the police station. they have designated rooms to conduct that type of business. also preferably do not go alone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR went to buy a bicycle for $200 from an OfferUp seller. after seeing a gun, went home without the bike or the cash. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "TIFU. I cheated (maybe) on my girlfriend who lives in the same building with me. \n\nI met this girl in late December last year right around Christmas. Nothing happened between us, although we were hanging out occasionally on the terrace and having coffee. In February, we made out once after a party, and again nothing happened, we distanced for a while and then stayed as friends. Late march, early April, we kind of started seeing each other no definitions, very casual scene, soon after I fell sick , and she had a trip to Thailand so we were apart for two weeks or so, when I came back , I fell sick again and went home for 1.5 months, we were basically doing long distance in a casual scene. When I came back, we did have conversations about who we are and where this is going(more on this later). During this time, my ex girlfriend texted me and I sexted with her(not exact sexting but flirting with the idea, we previously have slept after the breakup as well, she texts me every month or two). I talked to her a 3-4 times once in may, once in July, twice in august but never slept with her. When I came back from home, we had this conversation about where this is going and she said she is not ready to call it a relationship yet, at this point, I realised I didn't want to do a relationship anymore either, and in my mind had decided that I will end things with her. but didn't do it then, because she was again going on a trip and I didn't want to ruin her trip. Two days before the trip, she asked me whether I want to call it a relationship , I Was unsure but still said yes. Two days later, she went to the Vietnam, I came back to my home. During the trip, we had a lot of fights, and I was getting sure that I will breakup with her, when she comes back. A day before coming back, I texted this girl from my past who I really liked at one point, congratulations ( she became a doctor) and we got to talking. Next day she asked to see me if I haven't  left?, we met for 15 minutes in the hospital she was working at. when I came back, I was talking to her, but my girlfriend and I were fighting and I didn't want to talk to her anyway. She came back on 3rd sep, I went to the airport, picked her up and couple of hours later, we again had a fight and broke up. We didn't talk for two days, and 3rd day I went back to her room just so we could end things on a good note, but out of guilt, I said let's try again, and that thing got prolonged for 12 days, one day, I was taking a shower, and she saw the chats with my ex girlfriend, I hadn't talked to her for a while since I didn't want to sleep with her. After this, again out of guilt, I said give me a chance, two days later she agreed, and immediately within minutes I told her about the Girl from my past. We started fighting again, I kept saying that give me a chance just out of guilt. I started having anxiety attacks as well, ( I have been depressed for 5 years or so). She helped me with it and so did I,( she also has same issues, and she has done self harm as well). We were spending time with each other to help each other, but due to guilt I was constantly giving her the option to get back. She said that until I leave the building(I have been considering this) , we can stay in touch, stay normal I decided I don't want this and have been staying away from her for the past 2 days. now I don't know what to do. Did I cheat on her? Should I get back to her just because of guilt and since I never wanted to hurt her? What should I do?\n\nTL : DR\nI FUCKED UP WITH THE GIRL LIVING IN MY BUILDING. ",

I cheated (maybe) on my girlfriend who lives in the same building with me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I met this girl in late December last year right around Christmas. Nothing happened between us, although we were hanging out occasionally on the terrace and having coffee. In February, we made out once after a party, and again nothing happened, we distanced for a while and then stayed as friends. Late march, early April, we kind of started seeing each other no definitions, very casual scene, soon after I fell sick , and she had a trip to Thailand so we were apart for two weeks or so, when I came back , I fell sick again and went home for 1.5 months, we were basically doing long distance in a casual scene. When I came back, we did have conversations about who we are and where this is going(more on this later). During this time, my ex girlfriend texted me and I sexted with her(not exact sexting but flirting with the idea, we previously have slept after the breakup as well, she texts me every month or two). I talked to her a 3-4 times once in may, once in July, twice in august but never slept with her. When I came back from home, we had this conversation about where this is going and she said she is not ready to call it a relationship yet, at this point, I realised I didn&amp;#39;t want to do a relationship anymore either, and in my mind had decided that I will end things with her. but didn&amp;#39;t do it then, because she was again going on a trip and I didn&amp;#39;t want to ruin her trip. Two days before the trip, she asked me whether I want to call it a relationship , I Was unsure but still said yes. Two days later, she went to the Vietnam, I came back to my home. During the trip, we had a lot of fights, and I was getting sure that I will breakup with her, when she comes back. A day before coming back, I texted this girl from my past who I really liked at one point, congratulations ( she became a doctor) and we got to talking. Next day she asked to see me if I haven&amp;#39;t  left?, we met for 15 minutes in the hospital she was working at. when I came back, I was talking to her, but my girlfriend and I were fighting and I didn&amp;#39;t want to talk to her anyway. She came back on 3rd sep, I went to the airport, picked her up and couple of hours later, we again had a fight and broke up. We didn&amp;#39;t talk for two days, and 3rd day I went back to her room just so we could end things on a good note, but out of guilt, I said let&amp;#39;s try again, and that thing got prolonged for 12 days, one day, I was taking a shower, and she saw the chats with my ex girlfriend, I hadn&amp;#39;t talked to her for a while since I didn&amp;#39;t want to sleep with her. After this, again out of guilt, I said give me a chance, two days later she agreed, and immediately within minutes I told her about the Girl from my past. We started fighting again, I kept saying that give me a chance just out of guilt. I started having anxiety attacks as well, ( I have been depressed for 5 years or so). She helped me with it and so did I,( she also has same issues, and she has done self harm as well). We were spending time with each other to help each other, but due to guilt I was constantly giving her the option to get back. She said that until I leave the building(I have been considering this) , we can stay in touch, stay normal I decided I don&amp;#39;t want this and have been staying away from her for the past 2 days. now I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. Did I cheat on her? Should I get back to her just because of guilt and since I never wanted to hurt her? What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL : DR\nI FUCKED UP WITH THE GIRL LIVING IN MY BUILDING. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

To the point where he struggled to keep a job. Something that really bothered me was that he'd often leave dirty dishes on the counter and just forget to do them. It would often be days before he'd notice or remember them. Sometimes I'd remind him and he'd say he'd do it but then forget again.\n\nI knew that he wasn't doing it on purpose because he'd also forget things that inconvenienced him, e.g. cooking a large batch of food, leaving it to cool and then forgetting to put in the fridge later, wasting his time and money. I like to think I'm a considerate person, I started reminding him if I noticed it was getting late and his food was still out. I'd also put his milk back in the fridge or other things he'd forget about that could spoil.\n\nI also started doing his dishes if he left them out for more than a day, because it really bothered me and I honestly prefer doing them to having the awkward conversation. If he noticed he would ask me if I did them, and then apologize for leaving them out and ask me to just tell him to do them instead. But I'd done that and he'd forget again, so I'd just be dealing with the awkwardness for nothing.\n\n\n\nOne day he asked me when I **hadn't** actually done the dishes, so I said no. He shrugged and said he must have just done them and forgotten that he had. The next time he asked, I was frustrated and a lightbulb went off in my head - I could say no and he'd probably assume he'd just forgotten doing them.\n\nI said I hadn't, and it went exactly as I'd thought. I felt like a huge weight was off my shoulders, I could enjoy a cleaner home without having to play mommy to this guy.\n\nFrom then on I always denied doing his dishes, sometimes other things too. One time he went on a three-week trip and I went in his room and took out the dirty dishes and emptied his trash to prevent pests, because we'd struggled with flies.\n\nAfter a couple of months, he mentions to me that he's seeking a proper diagnosis and medical treatment for his ADD. In this country it's not particularly easy to get diagnosed and it costs a good amount money or a years-long waitlist. I encouraged him to do it because he clearly has problems. But then he admits to me that he's been particularly concerned because he's been forgetting things much more the last few months, particularly in terms of chores, and it's been disturbing him.\n\nI felt terrible. I almost confessed, but I worried about the consequences and fallout. Instead I just tapered off doing the chores.\n\nI feel conflicted because my intentions were good and my actions also had good consequences. He told his doctor about his distress and she got him bumped up the waitlist, now he's diagnosed and on Adderall. He seems to be doing a lot better in life, less forgetful, managing to hold down a job. But I still gaslighted him and caused him distress over a long period of time, so of course I feel guilty.\n\n\n\nTL;DR - I lied and let my roommate believe he was doing his chores and forgetting about it, in order to avoid awkward conversations, and in the process made him think his mental health was deteriorating.",

    "selftext": "I don't even know where to begin with this, the title makes it sound so bad but I don't know how to word it better. I apologize for how long this post will probably be- I guess I'll just start with some context.\n\nI (29M) and my wife Fiona (26F) have a stable, if somewhat generic, marriage. We have two kids (and a third that died). We have a solid friend group and a good family support system. Two notable members of this friend group are Garth (29M) and Cheri (24F). Garth is a friend I've had since high school and we still associate quite regularly. Cheri is Garth's wife, who I also met back when she was dating Garth, and we had similar interests and became quite close, quite quickly. \n\nAt this point I am closer to Cheri than I am to Garth due to our similar interests. We've never crossed any serious boundaries except for on one occasion when we fell asleep together on their couch while watching a movie. Nothing happened, but things looked shady for a while. We're now back to normal as both Garth and Fiona have realized it was an honest accident and nothing inappropriate happened.\n\nMy wife is quite religious, while I'm more of a \"direct spiritual connection to God\" type of person. As such we are both happy to be members of a small church that has a small community of friendly people. They do yearly courses and sessions on various topics, and one of the ones that was organized for this year was a marriage-related one. Essentially, it focuses on how one's relationship with God will affect one's relationship with others. Fiona and I both agreed that it would be nice to join the group. I spoke to Cheri and tried to convince her and Garth to join the group, and while Cheri was interested, she is a bit cliquey and didn't like a few of the people in the group so she ultimately declined.\n\nSo the first session rolls around, and that self-same day one of our children is not doing so well. Fiona opts to stay home which means that I would be going to the marriage study by myself. The group chat for the session revealed that two men, of the \"more traditional\" members of the study, were also staying home that session, and those were the two guys that Cheri hadn't wanted to be around while talking about marriage. I messaged this change of plans to Cheri and asked if she and Garth want to show up now that these two guys are gone.\n\nWhen I mentioned that Fiona is also staying at home, Cheri enthusiastically responded, \"How about I be your +1? Hahaha it would be so funny.\" I did think it was funny but I asked about Garth, which Cheri replied that he had just got home from work and could babysit the kids while she went out. Cheri checked with Garth and he was fine with her going out with me to the course just as friends. So, cue the TIFU, I decided to pick up Cheri on my way to the marriage course and show up with a +1 instead of, well, my actual wife.\n\nWell. It *was* funny. Cheri and I both laughed when she called herself my +1, and most of the other people in the group laughed as well. We explained the situation and everyone was mostly cool with it. During the session every so often when relationship topics came up, we would refer to our friendship as if it was a marriage that also had its issues and needed work, which was a regular source of comic relief for the group. Cheri also joked on our way back home that it was a good thing this particular session didn't have any discussions involving the bedroom or we would have looked very unconventional indeed. She also told me she was glad she came along with me. So it essentially went as expected.\n\nWhat I did *not* expect was for one of the women in the group to call my wife the next day. I had made the mistake of not telling Fiona that I was taking Cheri as essentially a \"stand-in for my wife\" (as the woman who called Fiona put it). I came home from work to find Fiona very upset with me, asking why I hadn't at least told her I was taking Cheri there. I explained that I didn't think it was very important to brief her on every plan I make with my friends. Fiona replied that this was different because there's an implied level of intimacy to courses like this and I had now created a semblance of said intimacy with Cheri. I did my best to assure her that this wasn't the case, I simply like Cheri and was hoping that by coming along she'd be convinced to actually join the group (with Garth of course).\n\nFiona didn't seem convinced though, probably due to the last time the boundaries had been accidentally blurred with Cheri. She went through my phone and read my messages with Cheri, which I let her do because I had nothing to hide. The messages revealed to Fiona that Cheri was generally the one to initiate contact with me, and that I was clearly the \"better person\" in our conversations, and that we never spoke about anything overtly inappropriate, and that if any boundary pushing had been happening at all, it was from Cheri, not me.\n\nSo now my reputation in the local community may have shifted because we all know how church people like to gossip a bit, and also my wife is unhappy with how I handled the situation.\n\nTL;DR took my friend's wife to a marriage course because my wife had to stay home. A nosy member of the group called my wife and pissed her right off, and she started thinking I was cheating on her..",

We&amp;#39;re now back to normal as both Garth and Fiona have realized it was an honest accident and nothing inappropriate happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife is quite religious, while I&amp;#39;m more of a &amp;quot;direct spiritual connection to God&amp;quot; type of person. As such we are both happy to be members of a small church that has a small community of friendly people. They do yearly courses and sessions on various topics, and one of the ones that was organized for this year was a marriage-related one. Essentially, it focuses on how one&amp;#39;s relationship with God will affect one&amp;#39;s relationship with others. Fiona and I both agreed that it would be nice to join the group. I spoke to Cheri and tried to convince her and Garth to join the group, and while Cheri was interested, she is a bit cliquey and didn&amp;#39;t like a few of the people in the group so she ultimately declined.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the first session rolls around, and that self-same day one of our children is not doing so well. Fiona opts to stay home which means that I would be going to the marriage study by myself. The group chat for the session revealed that two men, of the &amp;quot;more traditional&amp;quot; members of the study, were also staying home that session, and those were the two guys that Cheri hadn&amp;#39;t wanted to be around while talking about marriage. I messaged this change of plans to Cheri and asked if she and Garth want to show up now that these two guys are gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I mentioned that Fiona is also staying at home, Cheri enthusiastically responded, &amp;quot;How about I be your +1? Hahaha it would be so funny.&amp;quot; I did think it was funny but I asked about Garth, which Cheri replied that he had just got home from work and could babysit the kids while she went out. Cheri checked with Garth and he was fine with her going out with me to the course just as friends. So, cue the TIFU, I decided to pick up Cheri on my way to the marriage course and show up with a +1 instead of, well, my actual wife.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well. It &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; funny. Cheri and I both laughed when she called herself my +1, and most of the other people in the group laughed as well. We explained the situation and everyone was mostly cool with it. During the session every so often when relationship topics came up, we would refer to our friendship as if it was a marriage that also had its issues and needed work, which was a regular source of comic relief for the group. Cheri also joked on our way back home that it was a good thing this particular session didn&amp;#39;t have any discussions involving the bedroom or we would have looked very unconventional indeed. She also told me she was glad she came along with me. So it essentially went as expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; expect was for one of the women in the group to call my wife the next day. I had made the mistake of not telling Fiona that I was taking Cheri as essentially a &amp;quot;stand-in for my wife&amp;quot; (as the woman who called Fiona put it). I came home from work to find Fiona very upset with me, asking why I hadn&amp;#39;t at least told her I was taking Cheri there. I explained that I didn&amp;#39;t think it was very important to brief her on every plan I make with my friends. Fiona replied that this was different because there&amp;#39;s an implied level of intimacy to courses like this and I had now created a semblance of said intimacy with Cheri. I did my best to assure her that this wasn&amp;#39;t the case, I simply like Cheri and was hoping that by coming along she&amp;#39;d be convinced to actually join the group (with Garth of course).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fiona didn&amp;#39;t seem convinced though, probably due to the last time the boundaries had been accidentally blurred with Cheri. She went through my phone and read my messages with Cheri, which I let her do because I had nothing to hide. The messages revealed to Fiona that Cheri was generally the one to initiate contact with me, and that I was clearly the &amp;quot;better person&amp;quot; in our conversations, and that we never spoke about anything overtly inappropriate, and that if any boundary pushing had been happening at all, it was from Cheri, not me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now my reputation in the local community may have shifted because we all know how church people like to gossip a bit, and also my wife is unhappy with how I handled the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR took my friend&amp;#39;s wife to a marriage course because my wife had to stay home. A nosy member of the group called my wife and pissed her right off, and she started thinking I was cheating on her..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "I ate my first meal super late today. I didn\u2019t really make enough to fill me up and I don\u2019t keep much for snacks around. I poked my head in the freezer and there sat my mostly uneaten tub of Chapmans espresso frozen yogurt. I thought to myself, \u201cwhy not? I\u2019m an adult. I can have some fro-yo if I want.\u201d\n\nI grabbed a spoon and sat at the table with my 2L tub of delicious frozen dessert. I scrolled Reddit while carefully spooning small bits into my mouth because I have sensitive teeth. I stopped watching the time or how much I ate. Suddenly my guts rumbled. I can handle small amounts of dairy and the like but because I\u2019ve had my gallbladder removed I don\u2019t tolerate them very well in large portions. I looked at the tub. I\u2019m pretty sure I cleared a full litre of the delectable \u201csnack\u201d while doomscrolling through garbage. \n\nThe explosion was imminent. I popped the lid back on and threw it into the freezer while hobbling my way to the bathroom like some kind of sideshow freak. Now you might be saying \u201coh no, Larry-Man, this isn\u2019t a huge TIFU and shit happens\u201d but I haven\u2019t gotten to the worst part yet.\n\nAs I sit here typing this atop my porcelain throne, I am dying from stomach cramps while only 3 weeks post-op from my hysterectomy. I am basically trying not to cramp up so bad I damage things internally and I\u2019m terrified my vagina is gonna turn inside out. I\u2019m sweating buckets. And to make matters even more horrifying - the toilet roll is empty. And it\u2019s my fault. I was going to bring some fresh rolls into the bathroom after lunch. But in my haste to drop the kids off at the pool I forgot to bring it with me.\n\nSo while I\u2019m technically an adult I have been left unsupervised. I\u2019m at home alone and wondering if I can make it upstairs to the cleaning supplies closet to get toilet paper without leaving a trail of fecal destruction in my wake.\n\nAnd it\u2019s so bad that I don\u2019t even want to go into the shower without a pre-emptive wipe or 6. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s how this is gonna go but I\u2019m not happy about it. \n\nTL;DR: I gave myself the gut cramps by being irresponsible with my eating habits and am also trapped in the loo with no TP also due to my irresponsible behaviour of not restocking the bathroom.

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ate my first meal super late today. I didn\u2019t really make enough to fill me up and I don\u2019t keep much for snacks around. I poked my head in the freezer and there sat my mostly uneaten tub of Chapmans espresso frozen yogurt. I thought to myself, \u201cwhy not? I\u2019m an adult. I can have some fro-yo if I want.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grabbed a spoon and sat at the table with my 2L tub of delicious frozen dessert. I scrolled Reddit while carefully spooning small bits into my mouth because I have sensitive teeth. I stopped watching the time or how much I ate. Suddenly my guts rumbled. I can handle small amounts of dairy and the like but because I\u2019ve had my gallbladder removed I don\u2019t tolerate them very well in large portions. I looked at the tub. I\u2019m pretty sure I cleared a full litre of the delectable \u201csnack\u201d while doomscrolling through garbage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The explosion was imminent. I popped the lid back on and threw it into the freezer while hobbling my way to the bathroom like some kind of sideshow freak. Now you might be saying \u201coh no, Larry-Man, this isn\u2019t a huge TIFU and shit happens\u201d but I haven\u2019t gotten to the worst part yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I sit here typing this atop my porcelain throne, I am dying from stomach cramps while only 3 weeks post-op from my hysterectomy. I am basically trying not to cramp up so bad I damage things internally and I\u2019m terrified my vagina is gonna turn inside out. I\u2019m sweating buckets. And to make matters even more horrifying - the toilet roll is empty. And it\u2019s my fault. I was going to bring some fresh rolls into the bathroom after lunch. But in my haste to drop the kids off at the pool I forgot to bring it with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So while I\u2019m technically an adult I have been left unsupervised. I\u2019m at home alone and wondering if I can make it upstairs to the cleaning supplies closet to get toilet paper without leaving a trail of fecal destruction in my wake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it\u2019s so bad that I don\u2019t even want to go into the shower without a pre-emptive wipe or 6. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s how this is gonna go but I\u2019m not happy about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I gave myself the gut cramps by being irresponsible with my eating habits and am also trapped in the loo with no TP also due to my irresponsible behaviour of not restocking the bathroom. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "To be clear, this happened about last year but i still think about it because Spanish is the language of all time.\n\nFor context, i'm a Venezuelan-American. I was born in the US but i was actually raised in Venezuela for about the first 10 years of my life, this mainly consisted of visiting the family over the summer vacation (although i did spend one full year there when i was three, in fact my earliest memory ever is of my uncle tricking me into drinking beer at age 3 in a town called El Tigre). Obviously because of this upbringing i grew up fluent in both English and Spanish. The thing about Spanish though is that when you learn it, you're learning it, you're learning a specific version of it. English has it's regional differences too but at least in my experience it's not as big. Though the Spanish i speak is Venezuelan, growing up i at least knew that Colombians call beans \"frijoles\" instead of \"caraotas\" and that Spaniards use the \"vos\" prefix. Once i became an adult though, i came into much more contact with various different versions of Spanish.\n\nFrom confusing my coworkers by asking for a \"pitillo\" (straw in Venezuela, cigarette in Puerto Rico), getting confused when an Ecuadorean (i think) came into the store looking for a \"buso\" (jacket). But all of these usually result in a good laugh and we move on. Except for one time where i think the guy i accidentally offended was gonna take a swing at me. In the store i work at, we do offer free tailoring with purchase. This Salvadorian man came in looking for a suit and so we go to take his measurements. Now, we're speaking Spanish here\" so i asked him \"por favor quitate las cholas\" or \"please take of your sandals\". And there's the fuck up: he looked at me like i just called him the N-word. Because he could be heard across the store about how what i sad was bad, the manager had to come in to defuse the situation, explaining to the guy that i'm Venezuelan and we say different things or our words have different meanings. Thankfully it was resolved and he was able to get his suit.\n\nWhen i got home, i went online and searched if there were other meanings of the word. See, in Venezuela, as you have read, chola is slang for sandals. Yeah we say \"sandalia\" too but more often than not we're saying chola (unless they're from Maracaibo, that's the Quebec of Venezuela). As it turns out though, in several Central American countries, of which include El Salvador, chola/o is an indigenous slur. Well. That's the day i learned something. That said aside from being more careful, i'm not really sure what i'm supposed to do about it because that's not what it means where i'm from. It's like an Englishman not knowing the f-slur in the US does not mean what it means in England.\n\ntl;dr, nearly pissed off a customer because a word that has an innocent meaning in Venezuela is a no-no word in El Salvador.",

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this happened about last year but i still think about it because Spanish is the language of all time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For context, i&amp;#39;m a Venezuelan-American. I was born in the US but i was actually raised in Venezuela for about the first 10 years of my life, this mainly consisted of visiting the family over the summer vacation (although i did spend one full year there when i was three, in fact my earliest memory ever is of my uncle tricking me into drinking beer at age 3 in a town called El Tigre). Obviously because of this upbringing i grew up fluent in both English and Spanish. The thing about Spanish though is that when you learn it, you&amp;#39;re learning it, you&amp;#39;re learning a specific version of it. English has it&amp;#39;s regional differences too but at least in my experience it&amp;#39;s not as big. Though the Spanish i speak is Venezuelan, growing up i at least knew that Colombians call beans &amp;quot;frijoles&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;caraotas&amp;quot; and that Spaniards use the &amp;quot;vos&amp;quot; prefix. Once i became an adult though, i came into much more contact with various different versions of Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From confusing my coworkers by asking for a &amp;quot;pitillo&amp;quot; (straw in Venezuela, cigarette in Puerto Rico), getting confused when an Ecuadorean (i think) came into the store looking for a &amp;quot;buso&amp;quot; (jacket). But all of these usually result in a good laugh and we move on. Except for one time where i think the guy i accidentally offended was gonna take a swing at me. In the store i work at, we do offer free tailoring with purchase. This Salvadorian man came in looking for a suit and so we go to take his measurements. Now, we&amp;#39;re speaking Spanish here&amp;quot; so i asked him &amp;quot;por favor quitate las cholas&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;please take of your sandals&amp;quot;. And there&amp;#39;s the fuck up: he looked at me like i just called him the N-word. Because he could be heard across the store about how what i sad was bad, the manager had to come in to defuse the situation, explaining to the guy that i&amp;#39;m Venezuelan and we say different things or our words have different meanings. Thankfully it was resolved and he was able to get his suit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When i got home, i went online and searched if there were other meanings of the word. See, in Venezuela, as you have read, chola is slang for sandals. Yeah we say &amp;quot;sandalia&amp;quot; too but more often than not we&amp;#39;re saying chola (unless they&amp;#39;re from Maracaibo, that&amp;#39;s the Quebec of Venezuela). As it turns out though, in several Central American countries, of which include El Salvador, chola/o is an indigenous slur. Well. That&amp;#39;s the day i learned something. That said aside from being more careful, i&amp;#39;m not really sure what i&amp;#39;m supposed to do about it because that&amp;#39;s not what it means where i&amp;#39;m from. It&amp;#39;s like an Englishman not knowing the f-slur in the US does not mean what it means in England.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr, nearly pissed off a customer because a word that has an innocent meaning in Venezuela is a no-no word in El Salvador.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Despite it being the right passport number and last name, which is RARE, there are only two families in our entire country with that, AND him being a premium member at that air line. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: my dad might not be able to get on the plane, because I used the wrong name. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: IT GOT FIXED!! One to one and a half hours later, he finally got the name changed!! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Not once did they cross-reference the ticket with the passport. So yay that it got fixed, but wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyway apparently? \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the comments and upvotes!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "Hello Everyone. \n\nI am not sure how updating works, but after the many responses I received yesterday I just wanted to keep you all in the loop of the situation. I asked the Mods if I was allowed to post an update and they agreed (Thank you Mods)\n\nIf you don't know me &gt;[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1fi1dmw/tifu_by_turning_my_daughter_into_a_wannabe/) &lt; is my post from yesterday - \n\nFirstly, please can I thank everyone in the comments showing support and sharing your own stories. Thank you. \n\nI honestly thought, and still do to some extent, that I have f'ed up and failed my daughter. I thought her need to protect came from the fact she had seen me so broken. A comment which I have now lost said something along the lines of \"mummy got hurt by bad people, and now her friend is being threatened, so she wanted to stand up for us\". As honourable as that is, I don't want my little girl to feel that way. I want her to be a child for as long as she can be. I want her to play with her friends and have no cares in the world apart from who's going to be the goalkeeper or if she wants ham or turkey on a sandwich, do you know what I mean? \n\nI have spent some time with her over the weekend and last night reassuring her of that fact. I am always in her corner, I am always right behind her, and I will always believe her, no matter what. She has promised me going forward that she will always tell me, from the small things to the big things. I'm her Mum, no matter her age, she is always going to be my baby and I am always going to go to bat for her.  \n\nWe have also discussed if she feels safe in the school and if she feels the teachers would have dealt with it if she had told them - she said she feels safe, but she doesn't know if they would do anything, but she has never asked. This is something I will be keeping an eye on and discussing with other parents if their children have similar feelings.\n\nSo, on to the update - My daughter is suspended until Wednesday. I had a meeting with the deputy headmaster, because the headmaster is \"unavailable\" today. \n\nAlex's mum, who for ease I am going to call Joanne, had a meeting with him yesterday afternoon. For context, my meeting with him was about 20 min long. Joanne kept him locked in the office with her for nearly 2 hours. In those 2 hours, she made him go through chapter and verse the \"anti-bullying\" policy and explain each point to her. \n\nJoanne told me she had him admit that what the other child said to Alex alone should have been grounds for punishment. He still claims he had not been told about the threats and wants to open an investigation into his staff to \"get to the bottom of it\". Joanne told him she didn't care right now how he handled his staff, he needs to stop trying to place blame elsewhere, and take accountability. She told him, her first and only concern right now was that her child had been at the school less than a week and had received a threat of death twice, and the only person being punished is the only person who stood up for him. He reiterated that \"we have a zero tolerance policy\" to which Joanne stopped him mid sentence and asked him why her son wasn't included in that policy? He APOLOGISED and said \"I can see how that could look that way\", however he has not said how he would be fixing it because he has to do another \"investigation\"... I am starting to think he has a word of the day calendar or something. \n\nMy meeting with the deputy head was very basic, I think it was essentially just to placate me, but I have everything documented if I need to go through this again. My daughter has been suspended for fighting, she can return to school tomorrow morning. I did ask if the other child will be punished, but was told they can't discuss the other child and TBH that is fair, but I will be monitoring the situation. There will be no behaviour report or forced apology.\n\nLast night, we went to Alex's house and had dinner. Alex keeps telling my daughter \"you're on my Christmas card list for life\". I don't know where he got it from, but they think its hilarious. \n\nMy daughter has convinced Alex to try karate, they are very excited. Its karate night for us on Thursday, I will be talking with Sensei Paul about the altercation. Just so they can have a chat about safety, when to fight etc, more than anything else I just want her to be safe. She isn't an army, she is still a little person and she needs to remember that sometimes. \n\nI also told my daughter I told her story to some people on line, and I showed her some of the nicer comments. I asked her if she would like to choose a name you can call her, she has chosen Hawk... suddenly something clicked into place. The flying punch she did, it was a \"cobra punch\", the character Hawk (Cobra Kai) does them a lot, you sort of kick your leg like you're going to kick the opponent but instead move with a punch... NO ONE has taught her this move, but I have seen her jump off the settee and sort of do it before. When we started doing karate, I took that as an opportunity to introduce her to the the Karate Kid series, and obviously following that we started Cobra Kai. She is absolutly obsessed with Hawk and Tori (Minor spoiler for Cobra Kai &gt;!please don't talk to her about the end of the last season, she is very upset with Tori right now!&lt;) So we have now had another discussion about how we shouldn't replicate things we see in TV and Movies. Parenting is hard... and I have the teen years to come yet. I might just dye my hair grey now and get it over with.\n\nOne more thing I would like to address. I had two really horrid DM's regarding Alex's gender identity and sexual orientation - FIRSTLY, they are 9. He is figuring out who he is. If they are LGBTQ+, then that's who they are, but its no one's place but Alex's to determine that. He likes bright colours, he likes how make-up and nail polish makes people look, he is just unapologetically HIMSELF, and we can all learn a thing or two about that.\n\nOh, another thing. I never understood why people felt the need to justify themselves to the people in the comments claiming their stories were AI generated, but now experiencing it, it kinda stings a little. I am not writing this for validation, I don't know enough to care about whatever Karma Points are and I wouldn't know how to use Chat GPT if my life depended on it. I can't prove to you I am human, and this is real, nor does it really matter. But please be careful who you say that to, someone could be out here pouring their heart out and you completely diminish that by diminishing them. Just be kind to people, or don't say anything at all. You know what they say, opinions are like arseholes, everybody has one and they all stink. \n\nAnyways. \"Hawk\" saw some of the comments saying she deserves a treat, a lot of you were saying ice-cream... she doesn't want that. **She wants a sword**. Apart from being terrifying sometimes, I think she is going to be OK. I am going to buy her &gt; [this ](https://www.southernswords.co.uk/wood-grain-detailed-samurai-wakazashi-training-sword.html)&lt; training sword, and I think maybe some books about the Samurai. If anyone has any other suggestions, I am all ears!! I don't know if they will be a good or bad role model, but she seems like she has developed a passion for martial arts, and I am all about supporting physical activities, but getting some history in there would be amazing too. \n\nI'm sorry, I intended to keep this brief, but I just seem to waffle. I think I need to find more adults to talk to haha. I was never much into journaling growing up, but I can see why people do it, its nice to just get everything in your head out of there and in black and white. Things can seem a lot more simple when they are on the page. \n\nAnyway - I am not sure what the future holds, but I know we will tackle it head on, sword in hand apparently. \n\nThank you for the love, I really needed it. You are all great people.\n\n**TL;DR - Daughter is suspended until tomorrow, headmaster ate a piece of humble pie and is possibly now traumatised, Alex is going to try karate and my daughter wants the internet to know her as Hawk and she** **also wants a sword.** ",

The entire thing- from wall to lamp shade (which I attempted to adjust) conducts heat \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab \n\nI suppose it could\u2019ve been much worse, at least I didn\u2019t hit my head and burn my face? Anywayy this is more of a public service reminder that lights are hot!! I only touched it for like a quarter of a second and I could hear the singe\u2026 people maybe forget how much a burn hurts, and then 20 minutes go by (see, me) and then it really starts to hurt like a mf\n\nAlso if you find yourself in this predicament don\u2019t yell \u201coh fuck\u201d in your new apartment building. Instead just run to the sink and get those little fingers to cold water and cry a little over your beautiful, lost fingerprint\n\nTLDR I forgot that metal is hot and gave myself a kinda bad ouchie \ud83d\ude2d\n\nEdit: i was today years old when I found out the gerund form of singe is singeing, not singing.

I just moved in to a new apartment and there are these 2 really great adjustable reading lights right by the bed!! Score!! Only problem is they are not led lights- guess how I found out. And an added bonus! The entire thing- from wall to lamp shade (which I attempted to adjust) conducts heat \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it could\u2019ve been much worse, at least I didn\u2019t hit my head and burn my face? Anywayy this is more of a public service reminder that lights are hot!! I only touched it for like a quarter of a second and I could hear the singe\u2026 people maybe forget how much a burn hurts, and then 20 minutes go by (see, me) and then it really starts to hurt like a mf&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also if you find yourself in this predicament don\u2019t yell \u201coh fuck\u201d in your new apartment building. Instead just run to the sink and get those little fingers to cold water and cry a little over your beautiful, lost fingerprint&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR I forgot that metal is hot and gave myself a kinda bad ouchie \ud83d\ude2d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: i was today years old when I found out the gerund form of singe is singeing, not singing.

They are pretty chill people but like still I feel so bad even though everyone else was laughing, tf do I do &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: got far too drunk and threw up at a friend&amp;#39;s house, what do I do ? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "(Forgive me for any typos, English is my second language as I\u2019m Norwegian &amp; live in Norway.)\n\nI (F28) just screwed up so bad. Ironically, I travel a lot, so I bet my ADHD just got the best of me today. I just have to get this off my chest. \n\nI\u2019m on a work trip, which will take place in a city in the Lofoten Islands. I had to go by plane, AKA the cause of this mess.\n\nApparently there were some logistical issues today with the other flights. There were several messages over the speakers, but none regarding our flight. Except our flight being delayed, everything was ok. Until suddenly, two messages were broadcasted simultaneously. One regarding our flight and one regarding the flight that were supposed to leave at the gate next to us. Apparently, our gate was changed last minute. But it was kinda hard to tell as there were two different messages at the same time. I tried asking the lady next to me, and she agreed that our flight would be at gate 20. \n\nSo I just started walking, then I figured the group of tourists next to me didn\u2019t get the memo. They don\u2019t speak Norwegian and the message wasn\u2019t given in English, so I decided to be their hero today. And also I would\u2019ve freaked out if I were in a country where I didn\u2019t speak the language, only to therefore miss my floghr. So I asked one of them in English  \u201care you going to [final destination], because we have a new gate..\u201d He called for his group and they joined. So did another English speaking woman, as she overheard the conversation. \n\nWe walked across the airport only to see that the screen hadn\u2019t changed. This confused me, so I asked the lady from earlier: \u201cYou\u2019re going [here], right?\u201d NOPE! She\u2019s going to the next city over with a different plane.. So I went back to the TSA and asked them. They didn\u2019t know anything, but according to the time table our flight was still the same gate as originally planned.

Ironically, I travel a lot, so I bet my ADHD just got the best of me today. I just have to get this off my chest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m on a work trip, which will take place in a city in the Lofoten Islands. I had to go by plane, AKA the cause of this mess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently there were some logistical issues today with the other flights. There were several messages over the speakers, but none regarding our flight. Except our flight being delayed, everything was ok. Until suddenly, two messages were broadcasted simultaneously. One regarding our flight and one regarding the flight that were supposed to leave at the gate next to us. Apparently, our gate was changed last minute. But it was kinda hard to tell as there were two different messages at the same time. I tried asking the lady next to me, and she agreed that our flight would be at gate 20. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I just started walking, then I figured the group of tourists next to me didn\u2019t get the memo. They don\u2019t speak Norwegian and the message wasn\u2019t given in English, so I decided to be their hero today. And also I would\u2019ve freaked out if I were in a country where I didn\u2019t speak the language, only to therefore miss my floghr. So I asked one of them in English  \u201care you going to [final destination], because we have a new gate..\u201d He called for his group and they joined. So did another English speaking woman, as she overheard the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We walked across the airport only to see that the screen hadn\u2019t changed. This confused me, so I asked the lady from earlier: \u201cYou\u2019re going [here], right?\u201d NOPE! She\u2019s going to the next city over with a different plane.. So I went back to the TSA and asked them. They didn\u2019t know anything, but according to the time table our flight was still the same gate as originally planned. It even said \u201cgate closing\u201d so I started to freak out. Then I got the phone call..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lady: \u201cHi, this is from [insert air fare company].

    "selftext": "To preface this story, I am going to start with my opinion - I do not believe what my daughter did was wrong. In fact, I am incredibly proud of her, even though she may have been overzealous, her reasoning are very much in the right place. We have discussed at length what she should do if ever in this situation again (which I hope she is not).\n\nSo, lets start in the beginning, as it is the best place to start.\n\n(TL:DR at the bottom, as per tradition - also, just letting you all know this is a new account and my first time posting on Reddit - long time lurker - if I did anything wrong, sorry)\n\nI, 35F, have a wonderful 9 year old daughter. She is smart, and outgoing and just incredibly strong. 2 years ago, me and my ex-husband divorced. He fell out of love with me and fell into the bed of a 21 year old, its a story as old as time, but it doesn't hurt any less. About 6 months ago, I was mugged on my way home from work. I was messed up, I was covered in bruises, and in a lot of distress mentally. My ex is not a present father, he moved to France for work about 3 months after the divorce was finalised, so he wasn't able to help look after my daughter while I was healing, she spent some time with my Mum. But she saw me at my worst.\n\nI have a lot of guilt about that.\n\nShe began getting very anxious to leave the house, she didn't want to leave my side. She was worried Mummy would get hurt again.\n\nA friend of mine's son was being bullied at school a while back. She enrolled him in some karate classes, not for fighting, more to build his confidence and it really worked for him. She suggested that maybe putting my girl in some classes may help her feel more secure. I suggested this to her and she wanted to do them, but wanted me to do them too. Which to be honest, was probably a very good decision - I spoke to the Sensei and asked if I could sit in on the beginners class with her etc. I explained the situation, and he agreed.\n\nWe both loved it, she picked it up so quick and she loved the play activities with the other children. A few months after we started, she was leaps and bounds ahead of me and ready to play with a more advanced level of students. The bonus of that is the night the advanced kids met, was after the beginner adults met.\n\nSo we changed out nights, I started training with adults, she carried on with the advanced kids. She has picked it up so quickly. Her confidence in her ability is sky high too.\n\nA few times when we have been out she has seen something that has worried her, like someone walking towards us and she will grip my hand a little tighter and move herself in front of me. I keep reminding her I am the adult, we are safe and this is not her burden. (For anyone wondering, Mental Health Care is hard in the UK. We are not very well supported, she has spoken to a counceller that works with her school, she hasn't said that she needs to see anyone more, but we are on a waiting list. Therapy never hurt anyone, so why not look into it. But I can't afford to go private and the NHS just takes a very, very long time)\n\nFast forward a few weeks, last week was her first week back in school after the summer holidays. There was a new student in her class, we will call them Alex. Alex and my daughter have become the fastest of friends. She couldn't stop speaking about him on Monday when she came home from school. \"Alex likes this food\", \"Alex likes this TV show\", \"Alex said\", \"Alex did\" etc. Its adorable, but my kid has took it upon herself to be Alex's bodyguard. Alex is a very expressive child. They wear a school uniform, but Alex like's to wear nail polish, he has long hair which they wear pulled back or in a plait. He has bows on his shoes. He just wears what he wants and has the confidence to rock a potato sack if that is what he feels comfy in. His parents are amazing too. They have been so welcoming of my daughter and me too. We have had drinks this weekend after the incident and they are wonderful people.\n\nSo, the incident.\n\nLast Thursday, Alex changed his black nail polish for a deep plum purple colour. Some of the boys in their class decided to show how bad their upbringing was and told Alex \"you're a boy, you shouldn't wear girly things, because thats what makes you gay\". Both Alex and my daughter told them to shut up, and go bother someone else. This is when one of the bullies says \"If you're wearing girly stuff tomorrow, I'm going to kill you.\" (Yeah... you read that right).\n\nSo my girl, being a defiant little menace decided she wasn't going to tell an adult (we have had a very long conversation about this, don't worry) and she was going to handle this herself... Alex also decided he was going to handle things his own way too.\n\nFriday morning rolls round, the plum nail polish has gone and in its place is the most beautiful and vivid pink you have ever seen and his hair was in an elaborate viking style plait. It must have took a while. It was stunning.\n\nWell, apparently, this was like waving a red flag in front of the bully boys face. He marched up to Alex and told him he was going to kill him at lunch time. My girl told him he could try but she wouldn't let him.\n\nLunch came around and they were outside for playtime. True to his word the bully started to run at Alex and my girl took him out.\n\nNow, bare in mind up until this morning I only really had the details from two nine year olds. So when Alex told me she flew, I was fairly hesitant to believe him. He told me she punched the boy in the face, made him bleed, which made him cry and now he is petrified of her.\n\nI got a phone call from the school after lunch asking me to come and pick her up because she has been suspended for fighting. Alex was refusing to leave her and saying that if she was suspended so was he because it wasn't her fault. Alex's dad arrived at the same time I did to collect out kids, the headmaster told us that it was pending an investigation and we would be called in for a meeting on Monday.\n\nObviously when my daughter told me the full story I was livid, I asked why she didn't tell a teacher, she said she wanted to handle it so he knew he couldn't threaten people, but she told a teacher after the fact and they didn't believe her. So I am even more livid at this point. I contact Alex's parents and discuss, have a drink, bond over our kids etc.\n\nSo... this morning. 8am rolls around, I am sat in front of the headmaster, he begins to bemoan about how my daughter has brought violence to the school, how she has broken a boys nose and I SHIT YOU NOT, how this is very unladylike behaviour. I was honestly aghast. \"We are a zero tolerance school when it comes to violence\"... My daughter had been stood on top of a little wall at the edge of the playground, essentially keeping watch. She saw the kid running towards Alex, when he got close enough she launched herself off the wall, straight at the boy. She essentially did a flying punch, landed on him and then proceeded to lock her arms in his and keep him in place until the playtime supervisor arrived.\n\nI asked him how his investigation has gone, and he said he has spoken to the boy and because this was a \"completely unprovoked attack\" my daughter would be suspended further for the week, with a behaviour management programme and she would be expected to appologise to the boy she hit. I'll be honest guys, I have never been the confrontational type, I think it skipped a generation. But in that moment I summoned the spirit of my little girl.\n\nI asked him how he could have completed the \"investigation\" if neither my daughter, Alex or the parents had been involved. How he had come to such a conclusion without any facts or evidence? He just stumbled over his words. I asked him \"so is this what happens when students call someone names and threaten to kill them? You punish the person protecting them\". He was silent and said it was the first time he has heard of this and that he had been told it was unprovoked and my daughter was the only aggressor. I asked him who told him this and he was silent. I then called him a liar and that he was informed of the situation because both my daughter and Alex told him. I left the meeting telling him that my daughter was not suspended, however she would not be in school until the situation had been dealt with to a satisfactory conclusion. I have emailed her teacher and asked her to forward any work she would have been doing in class and she will do it from home.\n\nI have her with me in the office today, and my boss is letting me work from home for the rest of the week.\n\nI know I am responsible in part for what she has done, I know violence isn't the answer. I am very proud of her for standing up for what she believes in, but we have had a talk about how she needs to always tell me things like this.\n\nI am furious with her school. I called Alex's mum when I got out of the meeting. Alex isn't in today because they are having a meeting this afternoon about the bullying Alex has been subjected too. She has supported my actions though and said that if she doesn't get the right response today she will be pulling Alex too.\n\nThere aren't many primary schools locally that will have space left for them if the best decision is to pull them out of this school permanently, but I am not happy with how the headmaster has dealt with the situation to be honest.\n\nThanks for listening. I just needed to word vomit into a void.\n\nI have fucked my daughter up royally, I know.\n\n**TL;DR - My daughter used her karate training to defend her friend from a boy who said he was going to kill him. She broke his nose, but the headmaster is only punishing her. I am livid.**\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve posted an update - [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1fj0vcw/tifu_by_turning_my_daughter_into_a_wannabe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) - ",

    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To preface this story, I am going to start with my opinion - I do not believe what my daughter did was wrong. In fact, I am incredibly proud of her, even though she may have been overzealous, her reasoning are very much in the right place. We have discussed at length what she should do if ever in this situation again (which I hope she is not).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, lets start in the beginning, as it is the best place to start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(TL:DR at the bottom, as per tradition - also, just letting you all know this is a new account and my first time posting on Reddit - long time lurker - if I did anything wrong, sorry)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I, 35F, have a wonderful 9 year old daughter. She is smart, and outgoing and just incredibly strong. 2 years ago, me and my ex-husband divorced. He fell out of love with me and fell into the bed of a 21 year old, its a story as old as time, but it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt any less. About 6 months ago, I was mugged on my way home from work. I was messed up, I was covered in bruises, and in a lot of distress mentally. My ex is not a present father, he moved to France for work about 3 months after the divorce was finalised, so he wasn&amp;#39;t able to help look after my daughter while I was healing, she spent some time with my Mum. But she saw me at my worst.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of guilt about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She began getting very anxious to leave the house, she didn&amp;#39;t want to leave my side. She was worried Mummy would get hurt again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine&amp;#39;s son was being bullied at school a while back. She enrolled him in some karate classes, not for fighting, more to build his confidence and it really worked for him. She suggested that maybe putting my girl in some classes may help her feel more secure. I suggested this to her and she wanted to do them, but wanted me to do them too. Which to be honest, was probably a very good decision - I spoke to the Sensei and asked if I could sit in on the beginners class with her etc. I explained the situation, and he agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We both loved it, she picked it up so quick and she loved the play activities with the other children. A few months after we started, she was leaps and bounds ahead of me and ready to play with a more advanced level of students. The bonus of that is the night the advanced kids met, was after the beginner adults met.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we changed out nights, I started training with adults, she carried on with the advanced kids. She has picked it up so quickly. Her confidence in her ability is sky high too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few times when we have been out she has seen something that has worried her, like someone walking towards us and she will grip my hand a little tighter and move herself in front of me. I keep reminding her I am the adult, we are safe and this is not her burden. (For anyone wondering, Mental Health Care is hard in the UK. We are not very well supported, she has spoken to a counceller that works with her school, she hasn&amp;#39;t said that she needs to see anyone more, but we are on a waiting list. Therapy never hurt anyone, so why not look into it. But I can&amp;#39;t afford to go private and the NHS just takes a very, very long time)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few weeks, last week was her first week back in school after the summer holidays. There was a new student in her class, we will call them Alex. Alex and my daughter have become the fastest of friends. She couldn&amp;#39;t stop speaking about him on Monday when she came home from school. &amp;quot;Alex likes this food&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Alex likes this TV show&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Alex said&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Alex did&amp;quot; etc. Its adorable, but my kid has took it upon herself to be Alex&amp;#39;s bodyguard. Alex is a very expressive child. They wear a school uniform, but Alex like&amp;#39;s to wear nail polish, he has long hair which they wear pulled back or in a plait. He has bows on his shoes. He just wears what he wants and has the confidence to rock a potato sack if that is what he feels comfy in. His parents are amazing too. They have been so welcoming of my daughter and me too. We have had drinks this weekend after the incident and they are wonderful people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, the incident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, Alex changed his black nail polish for a deep plum purple colour. Some of the boys in their class decided to show how bad their upbringing was and told Alex &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re a boy, you shouldn&amp;#39;t wear girly things, because thats what makes you gay&amp;quot;. Both Alex and my daughter told them to shut up, and go bother someone else. This is when one of the bullies says &amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re wearing girly stuff tomorrow, I&amp;#39;m going to kill you.&amp;quot; (Yeah... you read that right).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my girl, being a defiant little menace decided she wasn&amp;#39;t going to tell an adult (we have had a very long conversation about this, don&amp;#39;t worry) and she was going to handle this herself... Alex also decided he was going to handle things his own way too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Friday morning rolls round, the plum nail polish has gone and in its place is the most beautiful and vivid pink you have ever seen and his hair was in an elaborate viking style plait. It must have took a while. It was stunning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, apparently, this was like waving a red flag in front of the bully boys face. He marched up to Alex and told him he was going to kill him at lunch time. My girl told him he could try but she wouldn&amp;#39;t let him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lunch came around and they were outside for playtime. True to his word the bully started to run at Alex and my girl took him out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, bare in mind up until this morning I only really had the details from two nine year olds. So when Alex told me she flew, I was fairly hesitant to believe him. He told me she punched the boy in the face, made him bleed, which made him cry and now he is petrified of her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a phone call from the school after lunch asking me to come and pick her up because she has been suspended for fighting. Alex was refusing to leave her and saying that if she was suspended so was he because it wasn&amp;#39;t her fault. Alex&amp;#39;s dad arrived at the same time I did to collect out kids, the headmaster told us that it was pending an investigation and we would be called in for a meeting on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously when my daughter told me the full story I was livid, I asked why she didn&amp;#39;t tell a teacher, she said she wanted to handle it so he knew he couldn&amp;#39;t threaten people, but she told a teacher after the fact and they didn&amp;#39;t believe her. So I am even more livid at this point. I contact Alex&amp;#39;s parents and discuss, have a drink, bond over our kids etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So... this morning. 8am rolls around, I am sat in front of the headmaster, he begins to bemoan about how my daughter has brought violence to the school, how she has broken a boys nose and I SHIT YOU NOT, how this is very unladylike behaviour. I was honestly aghast. &amp;quot;We are a zero tolerance school when it comes to violence&amp;quot;... My daughter had been stood on top of a little wall at the edge of the playground, essentially keeping watch. She saw the kid running towards Alex, when he got close enough she launched herself off the wall, straight at the boy. She essentially did a flying punch, landed on him and then proceeded to lock her arms in his and keep him in place until the playtime supervisor arrived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked him how his investigation has gone, and he said he has spoken to the boy and because this was a &amp;quot;completely unprovoked attack&amp;quot; my daughter would be suspended further for the week, with a behaviour management programme and she would be expected to appologise to the boy she hit. I&amp;#39;ll be honest guys, I have never been the confrontational type, I think it skipped a generation. But in that moment I summoned the spirit of my little girl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked him how he could have completed the &amp;quot;investigation&amp;quot; if neither my daughter, Alex or the parents had been involved. How he had come to such a conclusion without any facts or evidence? He just stumbled over his words. I asked him &amp;quot;so is this what happens when students call someone names and threaten to kill them? You punish the person protecting them&amp;quot;. He was silent and said it was the first time he has heard of this and that he had been told it was unprovoked and my daughter was the only aggressor. I asked him who told him this and he was silent. I then called him a liar and that he was informed of the situation because both my daughter and Alex told him. I left the meeting telling him that my daughter was not suspended, however she would not be in school until the situation had been dealt with to a satisfactory conclusion. I have emailed her teacher and asked her to forward any work she would have been doing in class and she will do it from home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have her with me in the office today, and my boss is letting me work from home for the rest of the week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I am responsible in part for what she has done, I know violence isn&amp;#39;t the answer. I am very proud of her for standing up for what she believes in, but we have had a talk about how she needs to always tell me things like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am furious with her school. I called Alex&amp;#39;s mum when I got out of the meeting. Alex isn&amp;#39;t in today because they are having a meeting this afternoon about the bullying Alex has been subjected too. She has supported my actions though and said that if she doesn&amp;#39;t get the right response today she will be pulling Alex too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;#39;t many primary schools locally that will have space left for them if the best decision is to pull them out of this school permanently, but I am not happy with how the headmaster has dealt with the situation to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening. I just needed to word vomit into a void.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have fucked my daughter up royally, I know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR - My daughter used her karate training to defend her friend from a boy who said he was going to kill him. She broke his nose, but the headmaster is only punishing her. I am livid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I\u2019ve posted an update - &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1fj0vcw/tifu_by_turning_my_daughter_into_a_wannabe/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "selftext": "This story starts a few years ago leading up to today.  I\u2019ll keep the background short.  I (23f) get a job at a well known company at a very hands on job and start dating someone (21m) in another department about a month and a half later.  We don\u2019t directly work together so theres not really any issues.  I move around to a few departments but never to his so we still don\u2019t work directly together.  About 6 months ago I get a promotion, but still no issues because I\u2019m not his supervisor since we\u2019re still in different departments.  Here\u2019s where it starts to unravel even though I was unaware of it until a few days ago.  In my department, there are 3 supervisors and we work rotating shifts.  Not long after I promote, one of the other supervisors steps down and I was assigned a lot of his shifts.  There is one guy (19m) In my department that comes in an hour after me so after we got to know each other a bit we started talking quite a bit while working since we were the only ones steadily in the department for a few hours in the morning.  He is very nice to everyone so I never thought of it as anything more than coworkers talking.  About 3 weeks ago, my boyfriend and I broke up and one of the first people I told was the guy I talk to a lot at work.  He would always ask if I had plans, and suddenly I didn\u2019t anymore so my answer became, watching tv.  A couple weeks ago, he had mentioned a movie he wanted to go see and I had said I wanted to see it also.  About a week ago, he mentioned he had plans to see it and asked if I might want to go.  I denied because I thought it would be awkward to go to a movie with my employee.  A few days ago, he asked again if I had plans, I said no watching tv.  He told me that movie was really good and said if I wanted to he would go see it again with me.  I didn\u2019t really say anything, then decided why not I\u2019ll go.  We got something to eat, went to the movie, and went and sat in the park, next to theater for a while talking.  I had a good time.  The next day, we were short staffed so I called him and a few others in for some overtime which he gladly accepted.  We left at the same time and he asked if I had plans again to which I told him the same answer and he had asked if I wanted to try this restaurant he had been talking about for a few months and I had mentioned I wanted to try it but had never been.  I didn\u2019t really respond, then sent him a message later that I would go because I wanted to try it.  After dinner we sat by the nearby river for 4 hours talking.  This is when I really really realized he wanted to be more than friends.  After talking very discreetly with another coworker about it, he had mentioned he noticed that this has been building up For a while and I was unknowingly feeding into it the whole time.  I really enjoyed spending time with him and getting to know him, but I can\u2019t date someone in my department since I am his boss.  I messaged him explaining the situation and now I feel terrible about it.  Maybe in another timeline we could be something more, but it just can\u2019t work without me risking my job.\n\nTL;DR I accidentally went on 2 dates with my employee then texted him that I can\u2019t hang out with him anymore even though I had fun because I\u2019m his boss.  Now I feel bad that I led him on knowing nothing could happen between us.",

It was 7am, I was looking at my phone and it was September and the south of England.\n\nLittle did I know, the whole carpark/path and road had frozen over night. Not just a little ice like you'd expect for a beach town, but ICE. Now, two things to note, 1, I was born with eardrum issues, 2, your ears control your balance...\n\nSo, by some miracle, I had made it to the middle of the car park before the ice decided I was now far enough from anything to grab onto and tripped me.\n\nI proceeded to run in place like a damn looney tune cartoon until eventually I fell back and hit my head and the small of my back.\n\nFeeling brave and strong and like the independent woman I wish I was, I proceeded to try to stand up, and made it 5 of my 5 foot 3 height before the ice took me again, this time however, I didn't run or fall, nope. I proceeded to do some kind of gymnastic/bambi/possessed splits with one leg going straight left and the other going straight behind me. Like a damn clock at 9:30.\n\nAs I was laying on the ice, it was at this point that I spotted my car, not only was it 15 feet away, but it was also incased in ice, complete with icicles connected the car to the ground.\n\nIn the most graceful zombie crawl I could manage, I crawled to my car to find the door was also iced shut. 3 hard tuggs later and finally the bastard opened and I lifted my fat ass into the seat, one leg normal and the other hanging outside and refusing to bend. Apparently unlike the rest of me, this leg is now determined to be straight...\n\nNow, problem 2, I am now stuck here and need to call work because fuck am I going in.\nThis starts the 15 minute phone call with my boss who I've only worked for, for a couple months. The entire time I described the previous story, I could hear him struggling not to laugh, until the bambi flail and then he proceeded to break and historically laugh for 10 more minutes until the call was finished.\n\nContemplating my options, I decide to drive my car towards the flat entrance, given I can't walk the over 100 feet journey. Just one problem, my poor, old car is still cased in ice, 60 minutes of the engine running and all heaters on, I finally managed to see enough through the windshield to coast my way along.\n\n15 more minutes of hobbling up the stairs to my flat and I collapsed on my sofa where I proceeded to be stuck with a swollen knee for 3 days.\n\nWhen I finally made it into the office, limping my way along, my manager took one look at me and laughed for another 10 minutes.\n\nAnd this concludes the story of how I became friends with my boss.\n\nTL;DR\nMy dumb ass made in to a middle of a carpark before slipping on ice, twice and having to army crawl to my car,phone in sick to work and hobble back home.",

So down to the last exam, i got pretty nervous about my exam. When i got to give my exam, i couldn't understand any questions. I messed up my exam pretty bad. And after giving exam, and some discussions with some friends, turned out i didn't do some problem worth 10-15 marks that i had practiced. I knew how to do them, I just couldn't understand the question. But i got nervous and forgot all that I knew. \n\nSo, now I don't know if I will pass or fail that exam. Had i done those problem that i knew of, I would have surely passed the exam, but I had to fuck it up by forgetting the questions I had practiced.

    "selftext": "Before I start, just wanna apologize for any improper grammar or if anything doesn't make sense, this has been eating me up and it's really late. I've always had issues with friends, I've always felt like everyone has a secret negative feeling about me. Last year, I got in a class with someone who I hadn't talked to for a few months, and because they were the only person I knew, we started to be friends again. For privacy sake, her name will be Janice. So, she re-introduced me to a mutual friend of ours who I also hadn't talked to for a while, Susan for privacy. I'm not sure why we stopped talking, I think just during the summer neither of us started a conversation so nothing really happened. Anyways, we all started to be a little trio and we texted almost everyday for a year because Susan didn't go to me and Janice's school. We all started to get really close and became bestfriends. I started to notice that Susan was a bit annoying to me but I didn't say anything to her or Janice. Then, Janice texted me after her and Susan had a little disagreement and was basically complaining about Susan. This is where it went all downhill. I agreed with Janice because I had also gotten into arguments and disagreements with Susan. Fast forward a little and we texted each other about annoying things Susan had done so much that it had just become part of our friendship. I honestly have no idea why I was friends with either of them because Janice's jokes sometimes went too far and Susan just annoyed me and we didn't really have anything in common. Me and Janice started to talk about things that Susan would tell us about her personal life as explanations for why we thought she acted the way she did. For example, if Susan would say something about one of our dirty rooms, we would get annoyed, text each other, and say how *event that happened in her life* was the reason why she commented on it. I don't know if it makes sense i'm so tired. It was all fine until Susan logged into Janice's account and read me and Janice's messages because she had a feeling that we were talking shit. For context, Janice told Susan her login to her account when Janice got her phone taken away and she could message people for her. So, when Susan read some of our messages, she logged back into her account and wrote two huge paragraphs on how disrespected she felt, how we betrayed her trust, and used things she told us personally against her. And i agree, we did all those things and it was shitty. We were a pair of two faced bitches. I private messages Susan to try to apologize to Susan, and she accepted even though I think she shouldn't have, and Janice said barely anything. The only few messages she said back was defending herself and bringing up how Susan also talked shit about this third girl, let's call her Rea, and her life and how messy it was. For some context, Rea is diagnosed bipolar and I also think schizophrenic. Susan basically said that she was aloud to talk shit because Rea was horrible to her and made her life hell, which she did. I know this sounds like stupid high school girl shit but Janice's mom messaged my mom asking how is she and I can't have her find out and I know she should know but it will take away the little trust I have from my parents. I talked to Susan today and she still seems upset, understandable, but I just want both of them to go away. I feel so messed up because I don't even feel guilty about saying that stuff, although I am so spooked I will never say anything bad about anyone ever again, I just feel guilty about her finding out. This is all making me realize that I never wanted to be friend with Janice or Susan in the first place, it had just been years since I'd had a proper friend that I felt like I could connect to. It also turns out that Janice was twisting some of my words to make Susan also lose in her trust in me. I've also realized I have a lot of pent up anger from when I went through something similar like a few years ago and I think the only reason I just want to run away and hide is because I never confronted the people who treated me like doodoo and we didn't a speak after Covid. Ok I don't know what else I can add or how I make this sound better I have not proof read this I am so tired it's like midnight \nTL;DR basically i befriended a shitty person and i said shitty things about my friend about stuff she told us personally, i apologies she forgave (she shouldn't have) she only found out cause she logged into shitty friends account and read messages, we made her mom cry, shitty friends mom messaged my mom asking how she was, i scared help what do i do",

I proceeded to push out what felt like an entire child, and when I saw the size of it, I was surprised my ass hole didn't rip open! I flushed the commercial grade toilet, and sure enough, it got clogged.\n\nNow, this isn't the first time I've clogged this very toilet. In fact, last time I had to go to the Walmart across the street and buy a plunger. \"Good thing I bought this plunger, I'll just quickly unclog this\" I thought. But no, it wasn't that easy. All of the contents went down the toilet, so I could no longer see it, but the massive shit-missile had such a tight seal on the toilet pipes, that no amount of plunging was going to help.\n\nI was freaking out, because I had been in the bathroom a while, trying to plunge this stupid fucking toilet. I googled ways to unclog a toilet, and I got the run-of-the-mill results. \"Use hot water and dish soap\" and \"call a fucking professional\" but I was obviously trying to keep this situation under raps, and I would prefer if it didn't become a news headline. \"A local delivery driver breaks the world record for the largest shit log ever recorded in human history, the toilet was irreparably damaged.\"\n\nIn the bathroom, there was a floor-level sink with a mop bucket. I put blazing hot water into the mop bucket and dumped it in the toilet, hoping to boil the shit loose, I guess. What do you know, ...nothing fucking happened. That shit log was acting like it thought could save the world by clinging to the sides of the pipe or whatever. At this point, I had spent over 25 minutes in the bathroom trying to plunge the toilet, and I decided that it wasn't working.\n\nI came out of the bathroom, and luckily nobody was waiting to use it. I grabbed a bottle of heavy duty degreaser, and dumped a generous amount into the toilet. I then let it soak for a half hour while I took a delivery. When I got back, I tried to plunge it again, but it was just as stubborn as when I started. Feel free to say I'm an unintelligent species, but I literally gave up. There was the perfect amount of water in the toilet to look like it wasn't clogged until you flushed it.\n\nI kind of feel like I may have booby-trapped the toilet, but what was I supposed to do? Go to the manager and be like \"hey, so I layed the fattest shit humanly possible in the toilet and now it's permanently clogged.\" I worked the rest of my 5 hour shift, and nobody mentioned anything, so for all I know the toilet is still occupied by the nachos I ate last night.\n\nTLDR; I clogged the work toilet with the world's most enormous shit, and I think it's still clogged.",

I googled ways to unclog a toilet, and I got the run-of-the-mill results. &amp;quot;Use hot water and dish soap&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;call a fucking professional&amp;quot; but I was obviously trying to keep this situation under raps, and I would prefer if it didn&amp;#39;t become a news headline. &amp;quot;A local delivery driver breaks the world record for the largest shit log ever recorded in human history, the toilet was irreparably damaged.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the bathroom, there was a floor-level sink with a mop bucket. I put blazing hot water into the mop bucket and dumped it in the toilet, hoping to boil the shit loose, I guess. What do you know, ...nothing fucking happened. That shit log was acting like it thought could save the world by clinging to the sides of the pipe or whatever. At this point, I had spent over 25 minutes in the bathroom trying to plunge the toilet, and I decided that it wasn&amp;#39;t working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came out of the bathroom, and luckily nobody was waiting to use it. I grabbed a bottle of heavy duty degreaser, and dumped a generous amount into the toilet. I then let it soak for a half hour while I took a delivery. When I got back, I tried to plunge it again, but it was just as stubborn as when I started. Feel free to say I&amp;#39;m an unintelligent species, but I literally gave up. There was the perfect amount of water in the toilet to look like it wasn&amp;#39;t clogged until you flushed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kind of feel like I may have booby-trapped the toilet, but what was I supposed to do? Go to the manager and be like &amp;quot;hey, so I layed the fattest shit humanly possible in the toilet and now it&amp;#39;s permanently clogged.&amp;quot; I worked the rest of my 5 hour shift, and nobody mentioned anything, so for all I know the toilet is still occupied by the nachos I ate last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR; I clogged the work toilet with the world&amp;#39;s most enormous shit, and I think it&amp;#39;s still clogged.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We had been talking for the past month and we related on a lot of things. I became very interested in her. Two of my cousins were getting married during this month as well and when their weddings were over, we made plans to go bowling. Tonight we went bowling together with one of her friends and it was amazing. She was everything I thought of and more. Beautiful, funny, and we vibed perfectly. Fast forward to when we leave, we go by her car and hug each other and that leads to use kissing for about 30 seconds. We had some alcohol (not that that\u2019s an excuse for my following behavior) but I pulled her back in for another round of kissing and even insisted that we go to my car on the other side of the parking lot so I can kiss her a little more in private away from her friend. She insisted she had work in the morning and that she should get home. I grabbed her arm again and then let her go abruptly and she hit the car in the back but was fine and then went home. She texted me tonight saying my behavior was disgusting and that she never wants to me see me again. I was absolutely in the wrong for what I did. I will never forget her. She was everything I wanted in a girl. This may be Karma but I know I deserve it. I\u2019ll never forget about her. And I\u2019ll never forgive myself for my behavior. \n\nTL;DR: Messed up with a girl I liked because I was being to aggressive in wanting her to kiss me and she cut me off for life. Never gonna forgive myself. ",
