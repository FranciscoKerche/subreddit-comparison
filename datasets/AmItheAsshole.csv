,AmItheAsshole,"I am (25F) living with my parents and my sibling (34F) and her partner (34M) with their two kids (3ys&amp;6m). I come from an asian muslim family, in our culture its the norm for kids to stay living with their parents even after marriage. Im currently unemployed and my sister and her husband run their own small f&amp;b business. 

My sister and her husband, barely clean up after themselves. they use the kitchen to make their food for customers and themselves and dont clean it up. They use a new cup everytime to drink water and dont wash em, sometimes theres even 5 cups just sitting by the water dispenser just from them. Their toddler makes a mess with his toys and leaves things everywhere, and spills his food everywhere and no the parents dont pick up after him, they'd just step over it.

today I finally said something to my sister, to start washing the cups after they use them and not use a new cup every single time they want to drink water because im sick of washing them, and im sick of getting scolded for not washing the dishes (even though I wasnt the one using them). She exploded at me and then told me and my mom not to worry cuz she'll move out soon and then started manic packing all of their things.

I apologized to her after but she wouldnt have it. She said that everyone has been judging her &amp; her husband for so long, but honestly if everyone is complaining that you never clean up after yourself, shouldnt the solution be you start cleaning up after yourself instead of threatening to run away?

I understand that being a mom of 2 very young children is hard.. I help where I can and my mom is very involved in taking care of the children as well. so leaving your's and your husband's finished plates on the dining table to  lock yourself in your room and your husband leaving a mountain of dishes from cooking in the sink from noon to 6pm because he wanted to go jogging at 5pm is..going to bring out some reactions.

my parents dont like to see the mess and they are nearing 60 so I dont want them to be doing chores when they dont have to so I always end up cleaning up the mess. My mom is also still working a 9-5 job and she gets tired from doing all the housework.

my mom scolded me after the fight, cuz thats my only sister and i shouldnt be so petty with her cuz shes working hard to make money and feed her children. and now with the threat of her moving out, my mom will be seperated from her grandchildren and that will break her heart. 

so idk, am I just being too sensitive?...am I being an asshole?

,AmItheAsshole,"My gf 5’4 and I 5’6 (both 26 NB) went to a concert last night, had already gotten our view blocked by a group of people taller than us (that thankfully moved), and then got blocked again.

The couple 5’10 in front of me blocks my view for like 2 or 3 songs, and even though I’m trying really hard to let it go and enjoy the concert, I’m not having a good time. So eventually, I gather my nerve to tap the couple on the shoulder and ask them if they could just take a step to the right, because they had more space to the right of them. I talk to the guy, and I start saying the line I rehearsed in my head, which was, “Hi, I don’t mean to be rude or anything, but me and my partner are having a really hard time seeing the stage. Could you two take a step to the right?” I think that wasn’t rude, and it was a good alternative from us moving outright and from being entitled and asking them to find another spot, which would just be rude as hell.

This guy cuts me off before I finish my sentence and motions for me to stand in front of him. He keeps repeating “Stand in front of me. Go. Stand in front of me.” Over and over again, cutting me off every time I tried saying “I don’t feel comfortable doing that.” It just felt super condescending the way he was saying it, and I didn’t feel comfortable going in front of him, and I knew my partner wouldn’t be comfortable with it either. So eventually, he gives up and says “I offered for you to go in front of me and you didn’t want to, so don’t complain.” They go back to looking at the front, and then a moment later he turns around and says, “We’re here dancing and having a good time. So don’t complain.”

I get mad and tell him “We’ve been standing here for over an hour, and you two just went right in front of us. You’re being fucking rude.”

Eventually we just left the concert after that, maybe like 5-10 minutes after that interaction. I really liked that spot because we had a good view of the stage despite being all the way in the back of the venue, and we were under an AC vent so there was no way we’d overheat (my partner is on sertraline and they overheat easily now, I just have always been susceptible to heat) so our positioning was optimal and I really didn’t want to move. I was also feeling thoroughly triggered by his “so don’t complain” comment because that’s been used to invalidate my feelings my whole life, and the one time I gathered my courage to make a (what I think) reasonable request from a stranger, I was met with that interaction. So there was no way I would be able to enjoy the concert because I was starting to cry and freak out, and I didn’t want to ruin anyone else’s enjoyment just because I couldn’t enjoy myself, so we left.

But I don’t know, should I have just kept my mouth shut? Should I have just sucked it up?? Or should I have just moved ??

My wife admits she's grumpy in the mornings especially when she is sick. This week she has a head cold.

This morning I accidentally spilled a bit of cereal and she stepped on it and she got really mad. I told her I'd clean it up. I was on my phone at the time and snickered at something on my phone and my wife kinda went off. She doesn't like me on my phone in the morning but she doesn't like me talking to her either. She often gets snappy with me if I bring up something she doesn't care about. She told me to ""Just stop being y-"" trailed off and said ""Just stop!"" And I thought it was a bit of an over reaction. She then tried to tell me that she was annoyed about the cereal again and I left the room I would have swept up the cereal but she hates when I sweep because the dust sets off her allergies. 

I hate how grumpy she is and I hate that I'm expected to sit and eat in total silence for 20 minutes every weekday morning for her to wake up. I have ADHD so I have really bad rejection sensitivity which makes this seem like a way bigger deal than it is. I hate how impulsive I am and I hate that my chatty self in the morning is so annoying. She told me later on over text that she was just grumpy because she's sick and damn well knew she was gonna bring up what annoyed her so I simply apologized for being annoying so she'd leave me alone.

Can anyone tell me what I can do in this situation?

,AmItheAsshole,"I (28f) and have been married to my husband ""Jake"" (28m) for 5 years.

We met and went to the same college. He studied pre-law while I was in animation. He graduated top of our class and went to a T20 law school. While he was in law school, I had a lot of trouble finding a job in my field or any job at all, really. I ended up working in a kitchen as a line cook to help support us (in addition to loans he took out) while he focused on his classes.

Jake got a very good job in a different state after he graduated, so I quit my job and haven't gotten another one since. We have no kids, a nice house for the two of us, and are overall living very comfortably. He works very long hours, so I take care of most of the household things—cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping, re-painting the walls, and doing other renovations.

In the last 6 months, Jake has started referring to me as his ""housewife"" around our family and friends. I've mostly been letting it go, but every single time it bothers me. I'm already insecure about not being able to find a good job, and it makes me feel even more inadequate. I finally reached my breaking point when we were with his mother on Sunday. They were talking about taking care of the lawn/garden, and Jake said, ""Thank goodness I have a housewife for that, or I'd never find the time,"" and they both laughed. It was humiliating.

I didn't say anything at first, but I guess he could tell that I was upset and asked what was wrong. I told him that he needed to stop emasculating me and making it seem like I didn't contribute anything to the household. We argued back and forth, and he told me he would stop calling me a housewife if I was going to ""get that upset about it,"" but that it wasn't an untrue term and I needed to stop being insecure.

Jake refuses to apologize. I feel like he doesn't fully appreciate my value as his wife. I've stopped doing the chores until he apologizes, and he is beyond pissed off. He’s been coming home and cooking dinner (only for himself) and doing the chores I haven’t, then taking off to spend the night at a friend’s house. I talked to my sister about it, and she said Jake was wrong, but I was being immature in my response. The thing is, if I give in, he’s going to keep thinking what he’s been doing is okay.

They were talking about taking care of the lawn/garden, and Jake said, &amp;quot;Thank goodness I have a housewife for that, or I&amp;#39;d never find the time,&amp;quot; and they both laughed. It was humiliating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t say anything at first, but I guess he could tell that I was upset and asked what was wrong. I told him that he needed to stop emasculating me and making it seem like I didn&amp;#39;t contribute anything to the household. We argued back and forth, and he told me he would stop calling me a housewife if I was going to &amp;quot;get that upset about it,&amp;quot; but that it wasn&amp;#39;t an untrue term and I needed to stop being insecure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jake refuses to apologize. I feel like he doesn&amp;#39;t fully appreciate my value as his wife. I&amp;#39;ve stopped doing the chores until he apologizes, and he is beyond pissed off. He’s been coming home and cooking dinner (only for himself) and doing the chores I haven’t, then taking off to spend the night at a friend’s house. I talked to my sister about it, and she said Jake was wrong, but I was being immature in my response. The thing is, if I give in, he’s going to keep thinking what he’s been doing is okay. I don’t even know anymore. AITA?&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"My husband and I have a close friend group, where it’s mostly been the three of us hanging out. Our friend went through a rough breakup and has dealt with some terrible relationships. Recently, a close friend of my husband’s started pursuing her. They've been seeing each other for a few months now, but this suitor has a bit of a reputation for ""kiss and tell,"" which makes my husband protective of her.

One night, the suitor made a joke in their group chat using a term he had previously used for his ex, which triggered my husband. My husband, not being one to mince words, asked a direct and pretty rude question to our friend. He expressed his suspicions that the suitor shared a term in their groupchat he used to describe his ex, and was worried that others may misunderstand that our friend is cheap or anything that may affect her dignity. This made our friend anxious, as she realized she might just be another topic in “guy talk.” She confronted the suitor and wouldn’t give him a chance to explain, which led to a huge argument.

Now, the suitor is furious, accusing my husband of sabotaging his chances and feeding our friend info to discourage her from dating him. My husband, however, did give her both sides of the story, including the good parts about him, as our friend asked for an honest opinion on the guy.

The suitor, feeling betrayed, told her he’s done and won't pursue her anymore. He implied that if she wanted to keep seeing him, she'd need to cut my husband off.

,AmItheAsshole,"I realize this is a petty topic to even be asking about but it’s been a tension topic every holiday/season for the past 5 years that we’ve been in this house so I need to know, who is the asshole? My husband (40M) and I 35(F), “argue” about the best place to store all my holiday/birthday/seasonal decor. We have an oversized 2 car garage with a full wall of those costco storage shelves plus two more shelves on another wall. He also has a whole wall with a workbench, cabinets, and shelves. These shelves are organized pretty awfully, if organized, we could have quite a bit of extra space. I have been asking to have one of those shelves, or even a half of one, to store my decorations on. He wants to have me store my decorations under the stairs instead. Our under stair storage isn’t like a walk in closet with finished walls and floor. It’s like an unfinished basement, super spidery, cement floor. There are things we use more often like guitar cases and filing cabinets in the front of the closet so I have to use the back and around the corner for my things. To get to them I have to take out everything in the front of the closet, get down on all four and climb under a pipe that’s about 3ft off the ground, back and forth. Then do this again at the end of the holiday to put them away. It makes me just not want to decorate, so I have pretty much given up on it. 

His argument is “You only use those things once per year, it doesn’t make sense to waste easy access shelf space for something that you use once a year.” 

I say “ I have to get things out and then back in again, so it’s twice per year for each holiday or season… So more like 12 times per year if I actually used my decorations.”

And while I understand what he is saying, the shelf that I’ve been asking to use only has mismatched home brewing items on it that he’s never used in 5 years “BUT, If I start making home brew, I will need to have easy access to it to work on it.” 

It really upsets me that he stands so firm on this subject when it is seemingly such a small issue that he could just let me try out, like who the fuck cares that much when it would make me really happy and he has nothing to lose?

,AmItheAsshole,"I (23F) recently got into an argument with my husband (24M) about his passwords. 

The other day, he was calling an insurance company and was asked for his password. He said it was his sister’s name. And I later found out he used that password for a lot of important things (other insurance companies.)
When the call was over, I asked if it was possible if he could change the password into something else. And he immediately got defensive and asked why, saying it’s just a password.

,AmItheAsshole,"AITA 

My partner 24/M and I 21/F have been dating for a year and used to work together and made a mutual friend 24/F. Everything was fine in the beginning until the three of us started hanging out together outside of work. 

One of the nights, we went out and were buying drinks in rounds however I was giving my partner my card for both of our rounds for our own personal reasons, but every time it got to the the mutual friends round she would buy a drink for herself and my partner but not me? And on top of that, she would still take sips out of my partners drink. During the same night, we ended up in a club where she was grinding on my partner which i tried to pull her off but she was pushing me away. My partner was not reciprocating - he was also very drunk and cannot remember this. There have been other nights out where we have arrived at the venue and she will jump into his arms but greet me half arsed. There have been other occasions where we have gone out and she has only offered to buy my partner a drink but not me.

When I worked there, if her and I were both on break. She would choose to sit with my partner who is working rather than sit with me while I was on break. 

I have since left the company but my partner still works there. She has messaged me things saying “is (M24) coming into today” in which I have responded “I don’t know” and she has responded back “I hope he is because I have changed my day in the office to see him” baring in mind I have not spoken to her since leaving the company. There has also been a situation where they have had normal conversations in work but she has gone shopping that day after work and bought him something he had spoken about in their conversation, but before giving them to him, she has sent him a message saying “I have got something for you”. 

Something very recent, my partner has been off work this week as he has not been well and she’s messaged him to ask if he is okay. 

My partner and I have fought about it loads because he does not see the issue with it and just thinks she’s being friendly, however I see it completely different. I have asked him to tell her that she is crossing a boundary in our relationship but he will not because he thinks there is no ill intentions behind what she is doing and wants to avoid awkward confrontation. He has said that if I feel that strongly about it, I should be the one to message her because I am the one with the issue. Every time I bring her name up in an argument, I feel like my partner just gets defensive and protective over her. 

Something to bear in mind, is that she is now dating my partners friend.

,AmItheAsshole,"I was the MOH in my family member's wedding a few weeks ago. We are very close in age and clearly very close, like sisters. I am good friends with all of her friends as well. There were 7 other girls in the wedding party apart from myself, so 8 of us total. I did so much for this wedding and created special gifts for each bridesmaid to make sure that all of them felt important and special during this time. This is not including just the day of the wedding, but during the bachelorette and included them in the personalized gift I spent MONTHS working on for the bride. Not that doing that should force anyone to be kind to me, haha, but I truly love these girls and try my best to be there for them during their lives and crisis'. I've known most of them for years and root for them always.

During the getting ready process, the party bus, and reception...not ONE of the girls took a photo with me. They took photos with each other and plenty of other people present at the wedding/reception, but LITERALLY not one single photo with me. I recognized it that night and it obviously hurt my feelings, but the next few days when everyone was sharing all their ""wedding pics"" on facebook, it really set in that there was nothing with me included. I love these girls and truly feel kind of stupid for even being upset lol Like I don't want to speak to any of them again. I feel like I'm being an A by feeling that way, but like y'all don't like me enough to include me, then why speak? I know it's just PHOTOS, but this has happened before during girls nights out and even at the bachelorette. I feel like it's become a pattern.

After the bride returned from her honeymoon, i did tell her my feelings but she didn't seem to think much about it. I think she understands why my feelings are hurt, but nothing more has been said. These girls from the wedding are around in my life often, but I really don't want to be around them lmao. If I do go around them, I am the type of person who will definitely say what i'm feeling, but I feel kinda dumb for being upset. I'm not one to really ever be upset like this at people, I don't usually take things personally. BUT I just don't care to be around them anymore and I'm worried that it'll create tension with my family member (Bride) and said friends.

We've been together for two and a half years, and we have a routine where she usually spends Friday and often Saturday nights at my place since she can't during the week because of school. In October, I started attending college in another city, which is about an hour and a half away from my town. The plan was for me to go there on Thursday and come back on Friday after classes so we could hang out and she could spend the night at my place. 

Today (Thursday), there was a change: I have a class on Saturday at 9 AM, so I called her to let her know I wouldn't be able to come home on Friday and that I'd come back on Saturday right after my class. She immediately became cold and angry, saying I was letting her down. She told me to come home after class on Friday and then leave for the other city at 6 AM on Saturday. If I didn't do that, she said I wasn't trying hard enough, and that i didn't want to spend the night with her, among other things. I explained that I couldn't make that happen, and then she started expressing sadness and anger, saying she could no longer endure this, that it was hurting her, begging me to avoid her because she can't avoid me, saying our relationship was falling apart because of this, that she loves me but can't live with this pain anymore, and so on.

It's important to mention that a friend of mine, with whom I'm attending college, asked if he could stay over at my place in the city where I attend collage because he had no other way to get to class. I agreed, but immediately regretted it because I thought about inviting my girlfriend to come to the other city and stay with me. She doesn't know about this yet, and I'm afraid to mention it to her because she'll start saying I'm doing this to be with him instead of her, that I did all of this on purpose, and she'll continue to say I don't love her, that she's the only one who cares in this relationship, and that I constantly hurt her. 

Every time I go to college, there's a fight. Something always happens, and I feel bad, sad and exhausted the entire time I'm in this city because she’s constantly angry at me. She tells me how much all of this hurts her, how she’s always crying, how terrible it is for her, how she’s the only one who loves, blaming herself for allowing me to hurt her like this, and so on.

**TL;DR:** I had plans to see my girlfriend on Friday, but I can't make it because of college. She's upset and feels let down, thinking I'm bailing on her.

,AmItheAsshole,"I’m 20, and have a sister who’s 15. We don’t live in the same place as I’ve moved out of my parents’ place and have my own apartment, but I occasionally go there to visit them. My sisters room is close to the room I stay in, and she usually leaves her door open if she’s not sleeping. I have noise sensitivity and don’t like loud noises that much (I only ever play music like 2~3 volume taps up if I listen to it) but my sister loves everything loud. She’ll play loud music that makes its way through the entire house, and isn’t that bothered by it.

So would I be an asshole for asking her to shut her door while playing her music, and to not leave it on if she’s going to be away?

,AmItheAsshole,"When my girlfriend got home last night, I noticed one of the guys from an apartment near us was having a go at her while she was parking. He was getting all worked up, pointing and talking down to her, and she looked visibly uncomfortable. 

So, I went down to see what was going on. The guy clammed up when he saw me, and my girlfriend told me he’d been giving her grief about her driving—saying she took the turn too slow, took too long to park, and all that.

I turned to him and asked what he thought he was playing at. He tried to brush it off as a joke, but I told him to back off and to leave her alone. I made it clear that he’d deliberately cornered a woman just to have a pop at her for no reason and that it was pathetic.

 He kept insisting I was overreacting and repeated it was “just a joke.” So I asked him how exactly that was meant to be funny, but he had nothing to say.

I warned him to stay away from her, and told him if he tries this again, I won’t be so polite. He then got defensive, saying I had no right to threaten him. I pointed out he had no right to intimidate my girlfriend just to boost his own ego and then backpedal the second someone called him out.

So let me explain, i've been friends with this guy(let's just call him david) for a really long time time now. We met in 7 grade when he was a funny and unserious person. At that time he was an easy going, down to earth and immature at times. We started talking after about 2 weeks of him joining our school. he had 3 gfs in one month, including me.After his last break up, i was the one who stood by his side and conforted him. About 2 weeks after that, he fell for me and asked me out. I accepted him bc i also fell for him since the beginning. So in our school, dating is not allowed. He didn't even care about those stuff and showered me with love at the wrong time.we broke uo for the total of 3 times . Fast foward about 2 months, i saw him holding hands with my ex bff. David and her were dating. About a month after that, my school had a field trip. I enjoyed every moment of it while stalking David 😅. And when we were supposed to get back, everyone hopped onto the bus and partied. We were singing and dancing until David sang a song for me...a song about how he didn't deserve me and I would be better off with someone else. After that song, everyone danced for abit and David sent a friend to tell me that he wanted to be my bf again. Even tho i still liked him, i told him it's best if we stay friends but we still acted like couples when there was nothing going on between us. After 2 days went by, my ex bff, David and i had some serious talk. I've come to learn that he still haven't cut contact with my ex bff who we'll call tima. We sorted things out and i was still on good terms with David. 2 months after that happened, HE DATED TIMA AGAIN. And guess what? She was dating 3 guys at the same time. And I told David. He got mad and never got a gf ever again. Fast forward to the present, he and i are still on good terms but he's a totally different person. It's like i don't even know him. He still likes me,i know. But he doesn't show it, we text sometimes. The way he responds to my text is like:
             
Me: hi
Him: hi
Me: i miss u

,AmItheAsshole,"So here’s the story. My wife and I are in our early 20s, running a business together and trying to build a stable life. A few months back, we took in my wife’s friend, who got kicked out of her mom’s place. We wanted to help her get back on her feet, but it’s been three months now, and honestly, I’m way past my limit.

I’m running our business, cleaning up the apartment, and even driving her friend to her job at a gas station. She’s not paying rent, not helping with bills, and doesn’t even pitch in for gas when I’m the one driving her around. She makes about $1,000 a month, but instead of trying to save up or contribute, she seems pretty comfortable with the setup, which I never intended to be long-term. Meanwhile, my wife thinks I’m being too harsh and that I need to give her friend more time, but at this point, I don’t even care about that.

It’s not just about her staying with us; we’ve had normal relationship arguments, and my wife shares them with her friend, so it feels like I’m constantly up against both of them. It’s exhausting, especially since I’d always put my wife first, while she seems to be choosing her friend over me. I’m seriously feeling like walking away just to get a break from all the stress they’re putting on me.

To top it off, her mom, who kicked her out, is fine with her again and is even taking her on vacation. It feels like I’m stuck handling her responsibilities while her family has moved on. I want her out, like yesterday. AITA for finally putting my foot down and saying it’s time for her to go?

Edit: The way she got kicked out was because her mom is mentally abusive. I don’t know much about the situation, but if my mom were mentally abusive, I wouldn’t go back to her house, take vacations with her, or go to parties and get drunk with her and family.

She’s supposed to be joining the army, and she was supposed to start basic training about four months ago. Apparently, her recruiter isn’t doing much to help, but despite saying for months that she’s going to basic, I haven’t seen her try to get a new recruiter or look into other options. I don’t know a lot about the process, but I’m not sure how long it usually takes to get things moving.

My wife gave her a timeline to be ready by January, but from what I can see, she’s not going to make it by then. She’s not making enough to get set up on her own. The job she has only covers her groceries, and she isn’t making enough to save for a place, let alone a down payment.

,AmItheAsshole,"Alright, so here we go. This has been a weird situation, and I’m really looking for honest feedback because I can’t tell if I’m overstepping here.

My (34M) wife (30F) recently got really into TikTok. At first, I thought it was just a fun way for her to unwind after work and watch a few funny videos or learn new recipes. But slowly, it started eating up more and more of her time. Every time I’d pass by, she’d be scrolling, headphones on, totally zoned out. I checked our weekly screen time report on a whim, and it showed she was on TikTok for around six hours daily. I get having hobbies and relaxation time, but this felt...extreme?

It started affecting our lives in small but frustrating ways. She’d forget things, like leaving dinner in the oven a bit too long because she was busy scrolling, or she’d agree to help out with something but get sidetracked. We stopped having little moments of connection because she was preoccupied with her feed.

When I brought it up, I tried to be calm and understanding. I told her that I was worried about how much time TikTok was taking up and how it seemed to be affecting her and us. But she got defensive, saying I was overreacting, that everyone uses social media, and that it wasn’t a big deal.

Eventually, we had a bigger conversation about it, and I told her I think it’s affecting her more than she realizes. I suggested she try limiting her time. She said that was “controlling” and that it felt like I didn’t trust her to manage her own time. I didn’t want to come off as a controlling partner, but I also feel like I can’t just sit back and watch our relationship suffer because of a social media app.

So, I set up a screen time limit on her phone (with her permission, and I’m following the same limits myself!). 

Now, we’re limited to two hours a day on TikTok.

&lt;p&gt;My (34M) wife (30F) recently got really into TikTok. At first, I thought it was just a fun way for her to unwind after work and watch a few funny videos or learn new recipes. But slowly, it started eating up more and more of her time. Every time I’d pass by, she’d be scrolling, headphones on, totally zoned out. I checked our weekly screen time report on a whim, and it showed she was on TikTok for around six hours daily. I get having hobbies and relaxation time, but this felt...extreme?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started affecting our lives in small but frustrating ways. She’d forget things, like leaving dinner in the oven a bit too long because she was busy scrolling, or she’d agree to help out with something but get sidetracked. We stopped having little moments of connection because she was preoccupied with her feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I brought it up, I tried to be calm and understanding. I told her that I was worried about how much time TikTok was taking up and how it seemed to be affecting her and us. But she got defensive, saying I was overreacting, that everyone uses social media, and that it wasn’t a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we had a bigger conversation about it, and I told her I think it’s affecting her more than she realizes. I suggested she try limiting her time. She said that was “controlling” and that it felt like I didn’t trust her to manage her own time. I didn’t want to come off as a controlling partner, but I also feel like I can’t just sit back and watch our relationship suffer because of a social media app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I set up a screen time limit on her phone (with her permission, and I’m following the same limits myself!). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we’re limited to two hours a day on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Reddit… AITA for setting limits on her (and my) TikTok time?&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for blowing up her phone for “scamming” me

Throwaway account, I (19m) am a college student and recently was interested in buying tickets to go watch one of our football games. I was going to buy tickets for me and a friend, my college has its own snapchat stories where you can buy tickets off of people, usually you send the money through venmo, zelle, etc and they email you the tickets. Usually I would take precautionary measures, send half until I get the tickets. 

However, this time I found someone selling the tickets for $30 each which was cheaper than most other people. So, I added her, we’ll call her susie(20f). I asked susie whether she still had the tickets. She said yes, i asked if they were still $30 she said yes, sent me a screenshot of where they were located and it was exactly where i needed them. So i let her know i would need to wait for my friend to send me money so i could buy them. 

Later in the night my buddy sent me his money so i went ahead to buy them, it was late and i just wanted to get it done so i sent her the money and was just waiting to get the email that she sent them. then she says “oh wait i thought you wanted both of them? they’re $60 each not $60 for both” which instantly caught me as strange since i confirmed the price and i feel like i had heard of people doing a similar scam but i just texted back “oh all could you just send it back real quick” she doesn’t respond. 

10 minutes go by, nothing, i text her number, nothing. and then i realize she left me on read on the text, which made me think she had transferred the money and dipped. so i called her and it goes directly to voicemail, text her again and the text doesn’t say delivered which is another sign that your number is blocked. so now im freaking out im a broke ass college student who’s never been scammed. i think i have to call my back get a fraudulent charge. but i decide im not gonna just give up so i call her probably 10 more times on snap. i wont lie a bit much but i thought i could brute force my money back. After that I went ahead and screenshotted her original ticket post and posted them on my story saying to not buy tickets from her. 

Then after an hour of no response, no calls going through, susie texts back. she’s says i’m a weirdo for blowing up her phone and who do i think i am leaving 15 calls and texting her so much and it hasn’t been that long. she said she was just in the gym and was finishing up her set. 

Now susie still hasn’t sent the money back, it’s been 5 hours, and i am actually blocked (text boxes are greyed out). Am i going crazy, i definitely feel embarassed about this but did i go to far?

,AmItheAsshole,"I (27M) moved out of my parent's house about a year ago because my very religious mother was extremely controlling (my way or the highway type). To give you an idea, she claimed going to mass every Sunday was part of the house rules, and if I didn't like it I could leave.
I used to contribute with groceries and gas money, but that all stopped when I moved out.

Ffw a year, my dad has been unemployed for that amount of time, and the family is struggling financially because he's the bread winner. One of my brothers also got diagnosed with stage 2 cancer (lymphoma), which put an even heavier toll on the finances.
This is when my parents start contacting me to try and get me to move back in with them. Ofc they wanted money, and by living with them I'd be able to not pay rent to a random landlord, but give my parents that money instead.

It sounded like a pretty sensible idea, and they really need that extra help to keep them afloat.
About a month and a half ago I moved in temporarily to their house, as they had to leave town with my brother to go get him immunotherapy.
All was fine and well: I took care of my youngest sibling, bought groceries, paid for gas, even gave my parents some money to help them out with their trip.

Parents came back a month after. All was going well. It got to the point where I was legitimately feeling quite comfortable, and I decided not to go back to my home for some time (not permanently yet).

Well, two days ago I was in my room with my GF (23F). We were both really tired and decided to take a nap together (something we routinely do). My mom knocks at my door to ask me some questions, and I tell her to come in.
The look of surprise/anger in her face when she saw us was really unexpected. She asked whatever she'd come to ask, I answered.
She left, but not before making it clear she'd ""leave the door open"" before storming out of the room.

Yesterday I confronted her and asked that she leave the door the same way she found it. My mother started an argument, saying she'd not leave the door closed while my GF was in my room, that my GF was wrong for being in my bed, and that I was doing something immoral by taking a nap with her in the same bed. She also said I could not take naps with my GF in her house anymore, because those were the rules.

The argument lasted for almost two hours, at which point I decided to just say ""fuck it"", packed my bags and left. I did tell my mom she could forget about the rent money, and she lost it, saying things like ""so you aren't really willing to help, huh?"".

,AmItheAsshole,"I (24F)live with my best friend(24M). We have lived together since college(almost 7 years now) and get along swimmingly for the most part. I am something of a perfectionist, and have low level OCD. I don’t mind a cluttered house, but I like everything to have its place, and don’t like it when things are randomly changed around. My friend is a mild hoarder and just keeps collecting things. He has been really trying to be better about it over the years and I appreciate the effort a lot. 

Recently, however, he has started leaving a whole bunch of his things in “random” places all over the house, like keeping his vests on a dining room chair, keeping his boots next to the couch instead of in the shoe rack, keeping jewelry on the bookshelf, etc. I was quiet about for a long time, but it has started becoming more and more things, and I recently had enough and confronted him about it. I asked him to not leave his things in random spots around the house, and he said “they aren’t random that’s where they go”. I explained to him that I didn’t think it was ok to just decide something of yours goes somewhere in the shared space, and it was really chafing my OCD. I asked him to move the stuff into his room, to which he replied he didn’t have any room. I told him that just because he was a hoarder who continues to get more stuff without having space for it, doesn’t entitle him to have it start spilling over into the shared spaces. I know I could have said it a less hostile way, but at this point I was pretty annoyed. He gets really defensive and upset when I call him a hoarder, and basically said when I tell him I don’t like having his things everywhere, it makes it seem like I don’t like living with him, because that’s how he’s always been, even as a kid. 

I’ve offered to help him find ways to organize his things more efficiently, and he said he won’t leave them around the house anymore, but he seemed really hurt and is not speaking to me.

,AmItheAsshole,"Okay, so, let’s start with some background information. I am a man in my thirties and I live with C-PTSD as a result of ongoing trauma in my childhood. I’ve come a long way in therapy and have managed to cobble together some meaningful relationships despite the fact that my disorder is notorious for encouraging social isolation in people who struggle with it. Part of the reason we struggle to be social and maintain relationships is because people with C-PTSD have a very over active inner critic. I have spent most of my life telling myself that I deserved my trauma because I was somehow unloveable, broken, or just wrong in some unknowable way.

Thankfully, I’ve found a patient a kind partner who knows all my secrets and reminds me everyday that my inner critic is wrong. He’s helped me in a lot of ways and my progress would not have come along as far as it has if it weren’t for his support. However, there’s one problem we seem to be stuck on and that’s my birthday.

He grew up celebrating “birthweeks,” and spent days as the centre of attention in his family when it was time to age up another year. I, on the other hand, hate my birthday. I don’t like having attention focussed on me, I don’t like feeling like I’m someone worth celebrating. I know this is a symptom of my C-PTSD but it still feels very real for me.

This discrepancy in our view of birthdays has been a cause for much tension between us. In the month leading up to my birthday he will pester me almost daily wondering what gift I want, what kind of party we should have, who we should invite to celebrate with us. It is very overwhelming and, surprise surprise, it has caused us to fight every year around my birthday, which… does not help me feel any better about that day.

He has been very vocal about the fact that birthdays are for more than just the person aging up and that they’re a special time to celebrate the people you love. It seems to me that he feels entitled to make a big show for my birthday, while I would rather let it slip by without ever addressing it. However, because of my C-PTSD, it’s hard for me to figure out if I truly am in the right for asking to ignore my birthday when he clearly wants to very badly.

To be clear, I celebrate his birthday in big ways because I know that’s what he wants. I’ve rented elaborate houses for our friends to celebrate in, I even proposed to him on his birthday. I do these things because I know it’s what he wants, so I’m not sure why it’s so hard for him to respect my wishes to let my “big day” slide by without a fuss.

Am I asking too much of him to not celebrate my birthday? Should I try to go along with his wishes, or keep expecting him to conform to mine? I honestly don’t know whether I’m trying to protect myself or if I’m just being an asshole, so it’s officially time to outsource this problem.

,AmItheAsshole,"Background: the Significant Other, Offspring, Offspring's Friend, and I attended a live symphony playing the entire score of the 1993 film Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Every single note and instrument played live. The movie played on a massive screen above the symphony. This performance was so popular it sold out the entire historic theater in our 100,000 person town. Which is hard to do. Dozens of school children even took buses from neighboring towns, on field trips, on the weekend, to experience this.

There were no live singers. So Danny Elfman, Catherine O'Hara, and entire cast's singing parts are played, in time, with the symphony. The symphony kept in time with the movie through the use of earpiece click tracks. Now, throughout the entire performance, the lyrics to all the songs displayed on the massive movie screen. Open captions. The kind that can't be turned off. So it's not like tech crew accidentally turned closed captions on.

Us four, and a good portion of the people around us, were singing along. Guided by the open caption lyrics on the screen. Not screaming. Not opera. Singing along. Half way through, the guy sitting next to Offspring's Friend leans over and shushes us telling us he didn't come to hear us sing.

I thought we might be in the wrong so I looked through the playbill seeing if any text read that we were discouraged from singing along. Nothing.

Every single note and instrument played live. The movie played on a massive screen above the symphony. This performance was so popular it sold out the entire historic theater in our 100,000 person town. Which is hard to do. Dozens of school children even took buses from neighboring towns, on field trips, on the weekend, to experience this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were no live singers. So Danny Elfman, Catherine O&amp;#39;Hara, and entire cast&amp;#39;s singing parts are played, in time, with the symphony. The symphony kept in time with the movie through the use of earpiece click tracks. Now, throughout the entire performance, the lyrics to all the songs displayed on the massive movie screen. Open captions. The kind that can&amp;#39;t be turned off. So it&amp;#39;s not like tech crew accidentally turned closed captions on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Us four, and a good portion of the people around us, were singing along. Guided by the open caption lyrics on the screen. Not screaming. Not opera. Singing along. Half way through, the guy sitting next to Offspring&amp;#39;s Friend leans over and shushes us telling us he didn&amp;#39;t come to hear us sing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought we might be in the wrong so I looked through the playbill seeing if any text read that we were discouraged from singing along. Nothing. Just a history of the film, info about the symphony and it&amp;#39;s conductor, and a list of upcoming performances. I know that Hamilton and Six discourage this in their playbills.

So 3 months ago, I (28F) got presale access to a major artist's concert because of my credit card and after confirming with my friends, I booked tickets for our whole group (my girl gang + some of their boyfriends). Because there's 10 of us, I did insist on being paid back immediately and everyone did except for one friend and her boyfriend but in general she tends to do things last minute. She did eventually pay me back a month later after I pestered her about it.

But now she's backing out of going to the concert and wants to resell their tickets at 3x. I've refused to list it at that price and would prefer to instead sell it at face value to my cousins (I couldn't book for them earlier because there was a limit of 10 tickets per user and they asked me after everyone else had already confirmed). She refuses to do so because she says she's already paid for the tickets and so legally they're hers. My POV was that if I'd known she was going to flake, I would've just bought tickets for my cousins. I think it's pretty selfish of her to be making a profit off of something she wouldn't even have if not for me especially when we've complained about not getting to see other artists we care about because of crazy resale prices.

Further context to add is that this is the third event I've booked tickets for her and her boyfriend and they've flaked. I've learnt my lesson and will never again be booking tickets for them in the future but unsure how to resolve the current situation. My other friends disapprove of her scalping but ultimately think we should just let her do what she wants but I'm not convinced.

,AmItheAsshole,"My ex and I divorced 8 years ago. We have a 12 year old son together. We don't discuss finances other than child support. I don't care for any money he may or may not give to our child directly.

Years ago I opened a savings account for my kid. I religiously transfer a set amount + child benefit into it every single month. I also put some ""loose change"" in there whenever I can. My kid knows of this account and gets to decide if any monetary gifts from family and friends are to be spent immediately or added to his growing savings. He doesn't keep tabs on the account, but has a rough idea of how much he ""gets"" every month and how much he's got already.

My son must've told my ex about the account, because my ex approached me about it.  
He asked to see the account- I refused.  
He asked to at least know the exact amount (he has a rough idea)- I refused, I don't see the point.  
He asked to contribute and become a ""co-owner"" (as in- the account is to be ""from mum and dad"")- I asked if he'd like to make a big initial payment- he doesn't, as he doesn't have ""that kind of money to just throw into an account nobody can access for years"" he just wants to join in now and throw in some cash here and there, but the amount that's already in there is to be overlooked. I refused.  
He told me that I can only afford that thanks to his child support contributions- I told him that the child support is his duty and is spent on our son's current needs, not for him to hold it over my head.  
He called me a jerk for not telling him about the account when I first opened it because now he's ""8 years behind"" and won't be able to match it and it will look bad when my kid grows up and only gets my support. I told him that it's up to him whether or not he invests in our child's future, he still has a long time to save something if he so wishes.

He told me I was a jerk for purposefully making him look like a ""bad dad"" for not having thought of something like this.

I don't think it's fair of him to ask to jump in and claim to have contributed to the savings I've worked hard on for years, but now I wonder if I actually acted like an AH for creating a situation in which I look like the ""better"" &amp; ""more caring"" parent? Should I have told him about it when I first opened the account? Should I just let him contribute to keep the peace? The money is going to end up in my son's account anyway, no matter if he receives payments from 2 savings accounts or just one.

EDIT 1: I thought I'd add, since this concern has already been raised a few times in the comments- it's an ISA nobody can withdraw money from until my child's 18th birthday (though I'm not sure he knows that), so I'm not too worried about any potential theft.

,AmItheAsshole,"About 3 months ago I (25F) started texting a woman, Mel (27F) before I moved to another city. We finally met up in September and immediately hit it off. It was like love at first sight for both of us. We also spent the day after the first date together. Two days after we met, Mel’s mom, Lauren (50F) came to visit her in town for what was supposed to be a few weeks but it’s turned out to be over a month. 

Mel is closeted, so while her mom is visiting she doesn’t want to stay away from home to raise any attention. Mel thinks there is nothing she can do about the situation with her mom. She talks about how she is scared of confrontation so she just does what her mom requires to keep the peace. I’ve told Mel that she is an adult and needs to speak up to get her freedom or life will always be like this for her. I also asked Mel if she was willing to speak up and she said no because it will upset Lauren. Mel is also an only child so she doesn’t understand how this situation looks from another POV. 

During the time Mel and I hang out, her mom calls her at least twice most times letting her know it’s late and she needs to come home. To me it’s insane to have that sort of control over someone at that age. I’ve grown up with strict parents but this is next level. 

I have started to love Mel and it’s been difficult to spend so little time together and always have that time restricted. I feel selfish for asking her for more time and awkward having to explain why the situation doesn’t feel right especially on Lauren’s part. 

Mel calls me just about every day to account for the lack of time but this last month has felt exhausting. While I do love Mel, I was willing to let her go if this continues to be an issue especially in our long term relationship.

I told her no, that I am proud of her and to keep workings at it. That the paintings will come with us and we can hang them up on the wall at home. That the spring art show will be another chance for her to show off her work. I wasn’t going to buy it when it literally will come home with us for free.

,AmItheAsshole,"So, a short note: I can only tell about my side of the story. The father (M30) of my (F31) two kids (M2,5; F1) and I are recently separated but still live together and have had a few difficult years. We bought a house 2,5 years ago when I was first pregnant and him turning to the wrong ""friends"" for the renovating led to him taking cocaine, which he (allegedly) stopped, us having big problems and him still having kind of an alcohol problem and overall bad health. He wasn't really there for the whole first year of the boy and whenever we need him because we are sick for example, he doesn't make it. He is good in handling the boy but has problems with the girl (and crying children!). So just recently I started a very small job again after being home as a parent, and usually my dad watched the girl but today there was no other solution than for my ex to watch both. The little one wasn't that happy and he refused to go an a walk with them or put them in the car (she usually sleeps then) and visit someone or anything. Only thing he does is put TV on. When I was done after 4 hours work, he lost it on me saying I am ruining the children and if I dont want to be a mother anymore I should tell him, I should be ashamed and so on. And that I should stop with the job until both go to kindergarten and take my old fulltime job again (where I would have to work weekends too, where there's no kindergarten...). So AITA for leaving the kids with him and wanting to work?

Edit after reading the first batch of comments: I didn't want to write down everything cause it's gonna be like a whole book but here we go: I only got to know of his drug problem after he stopped taking it (at least he says so). I knew something was wrong but not what exactly. Baby number 2 was an accident despite of taking birth control (seems to be genetic, I was conceived the same way). His alcohol problem consist of him drinking too much when he leaves the house. He never drinks at home. I work in veterinary medicine and I did think a lot about it but cancelling my shift would have been really uncool - and since he is good with the boy, k had hopes it would work out. I am already in the process of finding a solution to not live together anymore also in Cooperation with social services but so far I haven't found the right solution. I still receive money for staying home with baby, I live in Germany. He has a job in an office but keeps calling out I'll and he works with his own company in the cleaning field. So that's how we pay the bills. Hope that solved all the questions. And yes I definitely won't be doing that again, my dad watched the little on the other occasion but he's on vacation right now.

The father (M30) of my (F31) two kids (M2,5; F1) and I are recently separated but still live together and have had a few difficult years. We bought a house 2,5 years ago when I was first pregnant and him turning to the wrong &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; for the renovating led to him taking cocaine, which he (allegedly) stopped, us having big problems and him still having kind of an alcohol problem and overall bad health. He wasn&amp;#39;t really there for the whole first year of the boy and whenever we need him because we are sick for example, he doesn&amp;#39;t make it. He is good in handling the boy but has problems with the girl (and crying children!).

,AmItheAsshole,"My parents have my sister Amy (17F) and me (15F). They always liked Amy more. I'm not sure why. I don't know if I'm not their real kid or if they only wanted one kid and I ruined everything but they pay so much attention to Amy, show her so much love, support her in everything and I get nothing from them. My support comes from a couple of extended family members and friends and friends parents.

Examples; Amy since she was in elementary school got to pick what summer camp she went to and she never got told no for where she wanted to go. I was never given a choice. Some years I went to the local free one during the day and other years I went to no summer camp at all.

When Amy turned 8 she got a bedroom makeover and was given her own TV, a cool new bed, a desk space and a new computer and they put a mini fridge in it, all in pink to match her favorite color. I still don't have any of that stuff. The laptop I'm using now was a gift from a family member. When I turned 8 I was given used dolls from the thrift store that were from the dollar store (I saw them enough times to remember). Some were even broken with missing limbs or hair that was half pulled out.

My parents will buy Amy pizza or Taco Bell as a treat for ""being a good daughter"" and ""being their special girl"" and it happens at least 3 times a month where she gets it just because. I never get it just because. I don't even get it for doing good in a test like she would.

They spoil her whenever she does good in a test. I never get spoiled.

They told Amy they have money saved for her future. They never told me that.

I brought it up to my parents before but they brushed me off, even when I cried. My mom told me to stop being so childish.

That's why when my parents had a party Saturday for dad's birthday and they started boasting about Amy and how great her grades were, I kind of lost my temper and asked about me. I pointed out my grades were actually better than hers. But they never talk about me like that. I asked why they only talk about Amy. Why is she their favorite. Why don't they care more about me.

,AmItheAsshole,"My (F18) friend Lina (F19) is outspoken and can be intense, while I'm more soft-spoken and avoid conflict. Recently, she missed three days of college (it's the end of the semester, and she didn't want to come) and kept asking me to send her missed notes—which I didn't mind at the time. On the second day, she texted our group chat (there's three of us) to save her a spot in a lecture for a guest speaker. I didn't respond right away—| was busy organizing an event and just caught up in the bustle of the last days of college, so i didn't see her message until later. Our other friend simply doesn't use her phone during college hours, so she didn't see it either.

At lunch, Lina called me, but it was too loud to hear her, so I said I'd call her back. I forgot. Right before the lecture, she showed up furious, yelling at me and our other friend in the hall. I apologized immediately, but she ignored me the whole lecture. Afterward, I tried apologizing again, but she brushed it off, only asking for the work she missed. Later, she sent me a long, heated message, accusing me of disrespecting her and purposely ignoring her. I took accountability and apologized again, despite her reaction being disproportionate to what I did.

Even our other friend thought her behavior was harsh. She completely ignored my apology and only texted me when she wanted notes.
Since then, she's acted like nothing happened, but i feel unsettled. I was shaken by the whole thing and feel like didn't deserve to be spoken to like that, especially since she knows l struggle with conflict. While I do feel an apology was warranted on my part, it seems like she doesn't want my remorse and just wants to ignore me to ""get back"" at me.

Recently, she missed three days of college (it&amp;#39;s the end of the semester, and she didn&amp;#39;t want to come) and kept asking me to send her missed notes—which I didn&amp;#39;t mind at the time. On the second day, she texted our group chat (there&amp;#39;s three of us) to save her a spot in a lecture for a guest speaker. I didn&amp;#39;t respond right away—| was busy organizing an event and just caught up in the bustle of the last days of college, so i didn&amp;#39;t see her message until later. Our other friend simply doesn&amp;#39;t use her phone during college hours, so she didn&amp;#39;t see it either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At lunch, Lina called me, but it was too loud to hear her, so I said I&amp;#39;d call her back. I forgot. Right before the lecture, she showed up furious, yelling at me and our other friend in the hall. I apologized immediately, but she ignored me the whole lecture. Afterward, I tried apologizing again, but she brushed it off, only asking for the work she missed. Later, she sent me a long, heated message, accusing me of disrespecting her and purposely ignoring her. I took accountability and apologized again, despite her reaction being disproportionate to what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even our other friend thought her behavior was harsh. She completely ignored my apology and only texted me when she wanted notes.
Since then, she&amp;#39;s acted like nothing happened, but i feel unsettled. I was shaken by the whole thing and feel like didn&amp;#39;t deserve to be spoken to like that, especially since she knows l struggle with conflict. While I do feel an apology was warranted on my part, it seems like she doesn&amp;#39;t want my remorse and just wants to ignore me to &amp;quot;get back&amp;quot; at me. I brought it up with her and tried to confront her behavior to better understand her feelings and also talk about how her reaction made me uncomfortable but she doesn’t want to talk about it and brushed the whole thing off. &lt;/p&gt;

I told her multiple times I am busy, I had to tell her some details but she keeps pushing for specific schedules. Kind of implying I can't be busy all the time maybe? 

At first she was pushing for specific times, but I think as I said no she went more flexible and pushy. 

She will be gone soon and who knows when I will see her again if ever. I don't think she has any ill intention but right now I don't feel like putting on a mask to spend time with someone I don't genuinely like.

,AmItheAsshole,"**Background:**

Last year, my (20F) parents gifted me a 350 CC cruiser. It was a surprise: my father took me to the showroom to look at the bikes ""for a friend"" (and no I didn't get suspicious, I'm not that smart when it comes to these things), and a few weeks later, it was on our doorstep. Since it was a surprise, they hadn't consulted me about the customisations, so I ended up with a small  front visor with the sticker of a flower. The specific flower was the literal meaning of my name in Persian language. I didn't exactly like the visor(I would've preferred a long visor or no visor at all), but the flower was actually sweet, so I just ignored it. My brother (25) really hated the flower, and always complained about it whenever he had to borrow my bike, but I ignored it. 
***
Anyway, last week, I decided to just take the visor off with the sticker intact and just keep it. The sticker was a nice thoughtful touch by my mother (she calls me her &lt;the flower&gt; a lot, my contact is saved in her phone as the flower etc). I'm currently in the middle of board exams, so I was planning to do it *literally TOMORROW*.

This morning, my brother had to borrow my bike (I didn't mind). Around noon, my mother calls to ask why I let my brother take the sticker off. (I didn't?) So when he called a few minutes ago to ask my mother about some client, I yelled at him and he just asked me to leave it. AITA?

My grandpa was a motorcycle club president and member my whole life. When he moved out of state in 2005 he had to leave his club and sell his bike. When he moved back 10yrs later he wanted to get another bike but grandma refused. He saved money doing odd jobs for roughly 5yrs and bought himself a bike. Still grandma refused to register and insure it for him. 
He asked if I would. So I happily did. I am the only one in the family who is still into ""bike life"". He then told me, the bike was to be my inheritance upon his future passing. For the last 5yrs I have maintained the registration, insurance and taxes. 
He sadly passed unexpectedly in 8/2024. 
My grandma then insisted on selling his bike and collecting the money from it to make up for her income loss due to her not being able to collect both their SS checks now.
I told her I was not ready to sell the bike and that if it was reasonable I would just pay her out and keep it myself (even though I didn't feel I should have to pay for what was supposed to be mine).
I researched it and found it was worth roughly 1.8-2k. I told her I didn't have that much at that time but would in 2-3 months.
She then sold it from under me to her mechanic. He told her it was only worth $600 and she took his word. 
I am upset she sold it when I was not ready and more so that he screwed an old lady.
I have still not signed a bill of sale or been given the plates back, but he took the bike anyways.
Now my family has invited him to Thanksgiving and I am distraught.
I literally have nightmares about it and wake up crying at night.
I don't want to be around him and I am so tempted to list the bike as stolen, but don't want my grandma to get in trouble or mad at me.

,AmItheAsshole,"Throwaway account and fake names because my fiance uses Reddit. I 28m just proposed to my fiance 26f Sarah. I have one child from my wife passed away in 2021 from the virus. I honestly never thought I'd find love again but I did. The problem is that my fiance doesn't want my best friend Zara 29f to be my best woman. 

For context my best friend and I have been friends since we were seven years old. She and her family moved in next door and we both bonded over not having the best family situations. We've always had quite the sibling bond and even people who don't know us sometimes mistake us for siblings because of the way we interact. I love Zara like a little sister. She was there for me when my mom passed and when my wife passed in 2021. She used to bring over food for my son and I. She and her then boyfriend and now husband would take him out of the house if I just needed to be alone and my son adores her. She's been there for me at my worst and I wanted her to be apart of a new chapter in my life. 

The problem is that my fiance isn't really her biggest fan. When they first meet Sarah said that when she spoke to her she sounded rude and condescending, which is kind of true because Zara has a much deeper voice than most woman and is on the spectrum so she sounds monotonous all the time. I've explained that to Sarah but she thinks it's just an excuse. (I was with Sarah the first time they met and she didn't say anything rude or condescending). She's also very sarcastic so pair that with the voice and people think she's rude. She's actually very kind. She offers to take Sarah out for girls night when she and the other girlfriends of the friend group go, she's made an effort to bond with her but according to Sarah they just don't click which I was fine with because not everyone has to like each other. It's not like they're rude to each other and fight, they're quite friendly and cordial. 

Sarah and I were discussing wedding plans the other day and I brought up having Zara as my best woman and Sarah shot down the idea. When I asked why she said she didn't want Zara to stick out among the other groomsman. I assumed maybe she didn't want Zara to wear a dress because she loves her dresses so I told her she'd be fine wearing a suit but she still said no and I got confused and asked if she didn't want Zara in the wedding party at all and she said yes. She said she didn't want to give  her friends and other people the wrong impression of me (which to me was very childish.) I insisted that I want Zara as my best woman because as much as I consider my fiancee my best friend and want to make her happy, Zara is also an important person in my life and I want her by my side. She got frustrated and isn't speaking to me anymore and her friends think that this means that there's something going on between me and Zara.

The problem is that my fiance doesn&amp;#39;t want my best friend Zara 29f to be my best woman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context my best friend and I have been friends since we were seven years old. She and her family moved in next door and we both bonded over not having the best family situations. We&amp;#39;ve always had quite the sibling bond and even people who don&amp;#39;t know us sometimes mistake us for siblings because of the way we interact. I love Zara like a little sister. She was there for me when my mom passed and when my wife passed in 2021. She used to bring over food for my son and I. She and her then boyfriend and now husband would take him out of the house if I just needed to be alone and my son adores her. She&amp;#39;s been there for me at my worst and I wanted her to be apart of a new chapter in my life. &lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"I (15f) have a writing assignment for school where we are supposed to talk about our grandparents. This is (slightly) tricky for me. My dad's parents are fine. I know them. But my granddad (mom's dad) died when my mom was 3 and we never knew him. But his presence is still very strong in our family. My mom has photos of him and trinkets of his that she keeps in our house and she grew up always feeling someone was missing and wishing she could have spent some time with him that she could remember. He was always granddad.

My mom was 6/7 when her stepdad, or Grandpa Joe to me and my siblings, married granny. Even though my mom was so young she never saw Grandpa Joe as her dad or her real parent and she doesn't have as close of a relationship with him as she does granny. And when she had kids she introduced him as Grandpa Joe instead of just the grandparent title like the four bio grandparents are referred to. So we have grandma and grandpa (dad's parents) and granny and granddad (mom's parents) and then we have Grandpa Joe (mom's stepdad).

That's already a sensitive thing. Grandpa Joe hates being singled out as the only one who had his name added. But I think it would be worse if he ever found out that I wrote that I don't know all my grandparents and wrote about granddad. And then it was sort of confirmed because he and granny were over at our house the other night and they decided they wanted to see what my homework was like. My dad told them to leave it in case they deleted anything (neither are good with technology) but Grandpa Joe already saw the line about me not knowing all my grandparents and mentions of granddad. He asked why I needed to talk about granddad when I never knew him and then mentioned that I always had him as a grandfather but made him a step down grandparent to the others who didn't have their name added on.

They left soon after and mom told me to do what I feel is right. She pointed out it's only for school and doesn't need to be too serious or can be more personal if I want.

,AmItheAsshole,"Sorry for my English, it's not my first language.

Recently my brother (25m) brought is girlfriend home to meet the family. She stayed for 2 days.
For some context, my brother told us beforehand that she was stressed about meeting us since she come from a small family. My family consist of me(19f), my sister(21), my brother(her boyfriend), my other brother(27 and 29), my sister in law(28) and my nephew(2 month) and my two parents. Since we knew she was a bit scared, we decide to try and not overwhelmed her by asking to much question.

They both arrived Friday evening at 22h30. Since I was up, I greet them with my parents before going to sleep unlike my sister who was in her bed.
The morning after, my brother(29), his wife, her sister and their kid arrive.
In total we were 10.
We spend the Saturday spending time all together, playing board game...
In the evening we had an apero were we officially welcome her with a cheer.

On Sunday my brother send a long text without even talking to her directly to reprimand her because she ""didn't greet his girlfriend properly"" even though she did but on Saturday morning. That made her cry a lot because she didn't understand what she did wrong.
After that we spend the whole day discussing and catching up.
She left after dinner, my brother drove her back to the train station before coming back home.

Here come the real issue. Apparently, we didn't give her enough attention throughout the weekend, she felt unwelcomed and complained to my brother in the car. On Monday, (I had already left) my brother and my mother had an argument about the whole story and my mom I scared that my brother is getting manipulated by is girlfriend because he would never have done that before.

Personally, I don't appreciate his girlfriend. She didn't help in cooking, putting the table together, she didn't even directly interact with any of us, we were the one talking to her. I was ready to look over it because she make my brother happy but after hearing that she complained, I'm not so sure.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (19F) and my partner (20NB) have been together for a few years, the other day I got into a pretty heated argument with their mother and wanted to hear second opinions, as she continues to be steadfast in her belief that she was in the right, but i'm still pretty heated over this.

My partner and I have a dynamic that isn't very involved in each other's daily routines other than telling eachother how our days went and catching up, I don't have their routine memorized and they don't have my routine memorized and both of our routines switch around often, this is perfectly ok with both of us.

We live in one of the most expensive cities in North America, and because of this most students that are able to are still living at home with their parents (while finanically contributing to the household in some capacity).

The other day I went to visit my partner at the end of the day, I asked if they wanted to go for a drive and they agreed, we drove around for a couple hours and got back pretty late. When we got back their mom asked to speak to them privately, I waited in the other room for them.

As I waited their mom entered the room in a very heated way and began tearing into me for taking them out late on a school night. I responded that I didn't know and either way, as much as I want to support them I don't understand why I was being blamed for my partner's decision, their mom responded saying that they ""didn't have the strength to make the right decision"", I was extremely taken aback by the implication that I was responsible for my partner's choice and that I should be responsible for their life to an uncomfortable extent, she then went on to imply i didn't care about my partner.

I understand her want to support her child in succeeding academically (even if i think it's sometimes overbearing) and at the end of the day it's her house. My main upset is that I was being scolded for not taking on a caretaker-ish role with my partner and being held responsible for their decisions.

,AmItheAsshole,"Throwaway because I don't want my people that know me reading this.

I \[24F\] am the youngest to 3 brothers \[36M\], \[34M\], \[31M\]. Yes, I was the surprise baby and yes, I was coddled growing up. They're all married and I get along really well with my SILs. Between the 3 of them, I have 7 niblings  all of them under 10 and one of my SILs is pregnant with the 8th. She's my middle brother's wife and they already have two kids.

Here's the problem. When it used to be just 3 niblings, I used to have full auntie/niblings day where I would basically take them out from sunrise to sunset, sometimes it was in the middle of the week, sometimes in the weekend depending on my work/social schedules.

From the start, I made my boundaries clear because I had read horror stories about babysitting. I basically said that I will only offer that 1 day a week of auntie fun/babysitting and will only babysit otherwise if there was extreme circumstances, for example when one of my SILs had their second baby, I was more than happy to have their toddler over for a four days sleepover until they were out of the hospital and settled at home.

With each added member to our days, it became my worst nightmare to handle that many kids alone. Say what you want about me but that's a lot of responsibility and a lot of kids and just one me. So I started cutting the time and mixing and matching. Still same day but for example, I take one of my brothers' kids for something fun at breakfast. Another brother's kids to lunch and the last brother's kids to dinner and I'd mix it up the next week. No one had any problems with it.

Now that my SIL is heavily pregnant, 31 weeks, with their 3rd kid, she brought up the thought of me maybe keeping her kids all day and bringing them to stuff with the other niblings because she used to use that as a selfcare day for herself. I turned her down and told her my reasons 1) It would still be a lot of kids to handle if we merge, 5-6 and 2) it wouldn't be fair to the rest of my niblings.

She understood (no crazy, selfish SILs here) but I could feel her disappointment and that has me feeling guilty because I'm not a mom, I have no idea how hard it is for her. My brother talked to me after that and asked if I would reconsider if he sends their usual babysitter with me to help out? I told him I'd think about it but I don't want to be unfair to the other kids, plus, I don't know this person that he would be sending with me.

AITA if I also turn down that offer?

Edit: I want to say thank you for all your takes, I thought making an edit would be easier than replying to every comment, as much as I wish I can reply to everyone.

I just want to clarify first that I came up with the whole niblings day because I grew up somewhat close to my brothers despite the age gaps. Obviously we grew a part a bit when life started happening for them, they all moved out/went to college and here I was still in middle school but we got close again when I grew up and started to relate to them more. Anyway, that's all to say that I made the day so the kids and I have a relationship and their parents getting a small break was just an added bonus- something that I may need to remind them of.

A lot of people asked why my brother or other brothers don't have uncle days or trade off kids to give their wives time off and it's mostly because their schedules are rarely in sync unless it's around the holidays- we all get together then and they all divide the childcare among themselves, my dad pitches in too, and their wives (our mom and me) don't lift a finger. As for why parents don't help, they used to until my mom had hip surgery and they made it clear that they'll pitch in when they can but not to rely on them and my pregnant SIL's parents are hours away. 

As for the babysitter, I don't think it's that wild that they don't send her out in public with the kids but what do I know, I don't have kids lol. If they send her out with me, I think it would be awkward and uncomfortable because what if her caring style is different than mine? What if she thinks something is okay and I don't or the opposite? Who will the kids ask permission from? What if some of the kids ask something of her and she says yes and they run off while I'm busy with the others and I end up not keeping track of them? I'm the type that I need to know where every little one is at all times and at the end of the day, I wouldn't be her boss and have no right to ask stuff of her like I am.

As for my SILs, the pregnant one is a SAHM while the other two work so I imagine they want to wind down at home as well in the weekends with their family, Idk, I'm close to them but I don't ask them what they do (that's just weird because they're married to my brothers) unless they volunteer it in conversation.

A lot of you suggested I alternate between sets of kids each week but that would mean that I would only see each of them one time a month and I don't know about that yet. I know I'll have to dial back at some point and it won't always be this way but they're still so young and cute that I don't have the heart to pull the plug on our days. I do agree that we need to have a talk and that some things need to change though.

And finally, how I can even afford to do this every week, I'm a tech girly and was lucky enough to land a cushy job that's also flexible when it comes to remote/office time. My social life is healthy, guys, I don't just spend my time around family and I am dating, or trying to at least. It's not easy in the 2024 dating pool- no offense to any guys I'm sure you're all lovely.

,AmItheAsshole,"Me and my partner have been together for 3 years. When we got together we had both come out of long term relationships, I had to move back in with my Mum and he with his. 
He has a mortgage with his ex and 2 beautiful children male 11 and female 6. I think the world of them, and love the time together.
I finally brought my first home and moved in March, my partner also moved in with me. I made sure there was a room and space for the kids. They stay with us half the week. Whilst my partner cannot pay a huge amount due to still giving money to his ex he does contribute something.
Recently my partner has been away on a boys tour, he does this every October and looks forward to it. During this time I sent the usual loved up messages and so did he. He was due back on the Monday the same day as me (I was working on a residential for SEN children). I had asked if we could have that evening together as I knew I would be tired from the trip and wanted to get the home in order before having the kids round for the half term holidays. He told me he would sort it, unfortunately he did not and the kids were at the home on Monday. Whilst I was disappointed that he had not sorted it, we got on. The kids went to bed, we cleaned what we could. 
When going to bed he mentioned he had been hurt on tour, he showed me a bruise on his bum. I was surprised he hadn't mentioned anything since then, especially as he will message me most injuries (cut toe, cut finger, bruise etc). I asked why he hadn't mentioned this in text and he said he didn't want to worry me. This was said on the Monday, I accepted this and we went to bed. 
On Wednesday evening we had a couple of drinks. I enquired about the bruise again and mentioned how it didn't make sense he hadn't said anything. He got angry with me when I noted his story of who was there and what happened changed. He started to say how I just never drop anything and he couldn't believe I was going on about it. He then left the room and I followed at this point he was angry and I was upset. I should have given him the space but I was upset and wanted to sort this out especially as he has been distant since returning (both of us have, but put this down to tiredness). When I followed he started to shout, I asked him to keep his voice down as the kids were in bed, he responded by saying he wanted them to hear and if he hadn't been drinking he would have taken the kids and left. 
I left the home and slept in my car to allow him the space. I returned at aroind 1am and spent the remainder of the night on the sofa. This morning he won't even look at me and has told me he needs to decide what to do as I called him a liar. 
I am so confused by this, I love him so much yes I should have given him the space but I was so surprised and wanted to understand. 
We usually get on so well, but I think I have lost him and he doesn't want to be with me anymore. Any advice or AITAH and need to accept it.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (23F) and my mom (67F) have been arguing about a trip to FL for Christmas. Since I was a baby she took me every Christmas to visit her family in FL. We live in IL. But during covid we didn't go for 2 years.  We went in 2023 but I wasn't sure about going this year. I've always gone along with her because I had to when I was younger, but never really enjoyed as I got older since I don't know the family that well and it's not where I grew up. I brought up that I wanted to stay and she can go by herself. I have a boyfriend and a job and I honestly don't want to go anymore.



In 2024 my mom got diagnosed with stage 2 parkinsons and is experiencing small difficulties with movement but can still get around and walk. When I told her I wanted her to go without me this year, she said that I need to go because I can stop her from falling. I said if she thinks she'll fall she can use a wheelchair and that she will be ok.  She kept saying I'm not gonna do that, you have to come with me. She then mentioned that this one time I left the FL trip early to go home by myself that she had an anxiety attack and that she can't do that again. 



I feel she may just be trying to guilt trip me, because 2 months ago she had a high school reunion invite in FL. She was undecided but eventually said she didn't want to go. But today she said I took her reunion away from her and now I'm taking FL in Christmas too because she can't go without me because of her fear of falling. I did have a planned trip to Japan in the middle of her reunion date and I told her I could take the bus to the airport if she wanted to go to the reunion, but she said she didn't want to go and ended up dropping me off at the airport. Now today during our argument she's saying I prevented her from going to her reunion because of my trip even though I suggested the bus, and was saying she would have gone to the reunion if not for my trip/taking me to the airport. So I mentioned to her, both the Christmas family event and the high school reunion are in FL, why are you saying you would have been fine traveling alone for the reunion if not for my trip but you can't travel alone for this Christmas trip? She just kept telling me to shut up.



She says I'm selfish now and horrible. I feel justified in saying I don't want to go because I've gone for so long for these yearly trips, and she can still go without me and I think she needs to get over her fear of traveling alone and although she has parkinsons now, she can still use a wheelchair. She keeps saying I could stop her from falling, but I'm not sure if I could. I want to know if this is rude of me or is it fair to not go this year? I feel like I am an adult now and I shouldn't still be expected to go and it seems unfair to me that she keeps insulting me now. No one from FL ever comes to visit us, it just feels unfair to me that we're expected to always leave and go for weeks every year, so I just wanted to take a break. I suggested perhaps I can go next year.

My fiance and I live in a camper. There is not much space here, and while it can comfortably SLEEP ten people, it's barely enough space and not enough privacy for the two of us.

My fiance's sister (Sister) recently told us that her living situation had become intolerable. I won't go into the details lest we be here for days. But her aunt (Aunt) offered to allow her and her two children to live with Aunt. Aunt didn't have enough room for Sister's boyfriend (Boyfriend), however. So Sister asked if it was okay to let Boyfriend stay here with us in our camper for a while so that they can independently get jobs, save up money, and get everything together.

We agreed.

Boyfriend has been here for about three weeks now. Aunt just told my fiance last night that Sister and Boyfriend are broken up.

I was outraged. I was under the impression that the entire purpose of this was to help the family get back on their feet; I feel like it's a completely different scenario when you're asking me to invite this person into my house and asking me to change a lot about my life in order to help some random dude. It felt like Sister was just trying to pawn Boyfriend off on us instead of dealing with the breakup like an adult.

I asked Sister when they had broken up. She came at me aggressively saying it's none of my business, but eventually conceded that they had broken up months ago. Moments later, I am receiving messages from Aunt making comments about how I'm ""unable to just help someone out of the kindness of my heart"". Aunt later went on to say that ""[I] just don't want a third person in my camper"".

We have helped people before. Friends, even strangers. We had invited someone to live permanently with us at one point. I have no problem with a third person here. I simply felt like I was lied to about the entire scenario, then later treated like a villain when I tried to ask questions about what was truly going on.

My fiance pretty much agrees. They even tried throwing him under the bus by saying that he has known all along that they were broken up. Even though the reason I brought it up was because my fiance was outraged when he learned about it last night.

I don't feel that I'm wrong in wanting to know more information about the person I'm inviting into my home and the circumstances that brought him here. And I wasn't aggressive in the way that I went about asking these questions despite being infuriated. Yet I was personally attacked multiple times.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (29M) proposed to my girlfriend (25F), now wife, in March 2024 and my former friend (24F) was and still is upset 7 months later.

I proposed to my girlfriend by doing a donut around her while my two best friends did a burnout nearby. Everything went well and she said yes! We are now married and everything has been great. The only issue has been that one of my former friend (""Jane"") was very upset on how I proposed and the type of ring I used as she claimed I stole her ideas and involved her boyfriend (one of my best friends).

I have been friends with her and her boyfriend for two years and I would say I was reason of them getting together. I was their confidant and we shared a lot of good memories together.

The ring and the event itself, to my understanding, are the main reasons according to her.

During the holidays we went together to shop for gifts. During the trip, she wanted to stop by a Moissanite store to show her boyfriend some rings and I went with them. I never really liked diamonds and was trying to find alternatives so I thought moissanite was a good option.

Jane was about 4 months pregnant. My best friend (her boyfriend) had seen a video on IG about a burnout gender reveal and wanted to do the same thing. I suggested a spot I knew that would perfect.

My wife and I are really big car people. We met after she saw one of my cars at a show. She DMd me and on our first date we did donuts on the spot I would later propose and the place I would suggest for them to do the gender reveal.

After I proposed, Jane started acting wierd. She leaves all the group chats and she turns off her location, etc. I asked her what was wrong and tells me she is upset that ""I stole her idea"" and involved her boyfriend. I tried to explain my rationale to why I propose the way I did but she didn't care. I apologized as it was never my intention to ""steal her idea"" but she didn't care.

I gave her time because she's hormonal due to pregnancy. 

I learned later that she had apparently been bother about the ring for awhile. She had told another friend about it but she never told me anything even after I showed it to her before I proposed.

Months go by and I stop trying to apologize. I wish her well wishes for the delivery. After her baby was born I had some hope she would reach out but she never did.

The more time passes the more I know I did anything wrong. If you google diamond ring alternative Moissanite is the first result and a gender reveal burnout is nothing unique. She never communicated anything to me even after she knew about the ring and proposal. She made my whole proposal about herself and now have ruined a special moment.

I told my best friend how I felt and that I'm owed an apology and he agreed and said he would tell her. 

I just recently learned that she told a coworker that she is never going to apologize and that she doesn't feel like she did anything wrong.

,AmItheAsshole,"I made a cake for my bestfriend/business partner’s birthday. 

For context, it’s my first time making a cake. I did a lot of research, slept late, woke up really early to prepare the cake to surprise my friend. I spent more money to buy the ingredients and tools compared to just buying a cake. I’m also struggling a bit with my finances now but I still wanted to put in an effort for my bff’s birthday. I thought of making a cake since he’s a massive fan of sweets and I incorporated biscoff which he absolutely loves. 

I gave the cake on his birthday itself and he was thankful for it. 

He had another bday celeb with his family and their staff the day after his actual bday and he’ll eat the cake during that celeb. I didn’t come since I had a part-time job around that time so I was just working in the office while they were eating upstairs.

After the celeb, he brought back the cake to our office and I noticed only a few slices were eaten (around 1/6 only) so I asked how it was. He said both him and his family thought it was good.

I got a bit sad because I thought na if it was really good, more slices would be eaten. So even though he said it tastes good, I had some doubts.

Few hours after the celeb, I asked what he plans to do with the cake since he won’t be going to the office for 3 days so it might just go bad. I suggested he should just bring the cake home so he could also eat it during the weekend. 

He didn’t want to bring it home because he thought it was a hassle. He said to just put it in the freezer. I joked around and said “you just don’t like the cake I made” and he got very angry.

He said that he already said it was good, yet I'm still sad. Either way, whether he says it's delicious or tastes bad, I'll still be depressed. Why can't I just take his feedback and appreciation? And next time, he said I shouldn't make him a cake anymore.

So I got angry as well since I was just suggested for him to bring the cake him and he felt pressured and forced to do so. I just felt like all my effort and time just went to waste. 

Am I the asshole here? Are my feelings valid? 

Pls be kind I’m already sad enough. Thank you.

,AmItheAsshole,"Context, I am a 22 year old genderfluid afab person, living with my parents. I also have a skin condition called HS, or Hidradenitis suppurativa/acne inversa, which I was diagnosed with earlier this year.

This morning I was talking to my parents about something random and my dad noticed one of my HS sores on my shoulder and asked what happened (he often mistakes them for injuries). I explained it was a flare up of my HS triggered from my bra straps and that I get them quite often, they're just normally covered by my shirts, and showed him the identical sores on my other shoulder. 

My mom commented that we'd have to experiment with a different type of fabric for my bras to get rid of the irritation, and I told her I mostly fix the problem by just not wearing bras at all, reserving them for outfits or situations that require them (working out, going to a special event, or wearing a shirt/dress where one would need to wear a bra)

When I said that I got disappointed looks from both parents and my mom said ""well not wearing a bra is not an option"" and I just said ""agree to disagree"" and excused myself because I needed to run an errand. 

Now I'm wondering if I'm an AH for choosing to not wear a bra. I'm one of those people who believes women should not be required to wear bras ever, and that breasts should not be sexualized so much. The social constructs around womens chests are ridiculous. But I also recognize that I have a moderately large chest, and my parents are typically very modest people, so maybe me being braless makes them uncomfortable.

,AmItheAsshole,"So long story short, my husband’s parents are divorced and his dad found a new partner rather quickly if you know what I mean. Anyways, the lady has been nothing but disrespectful from the start but I’ve always stayed out of it as it’s not my family drama and I know exactly the type of woman she is. 

Two years ago, she started drama with me over the fact that I mentioned it would be great if we all spent Christmas together in a city/home that was bought by my husband’s parents before the divorce and the father kept it after. She took it as me inviting her to “her own home” and demanded I apologize. It’s been basically two years since the debacle and my husband has tried to have sit down convos with her but she is extremely irrational and entitled. A lot has happened since then but back in April 2024, she left notes in that house in places where someone staying in the house would find them e.g. the bathroom drawer. The notes said “don’t be curious” as to catch me snooping. Well during our stay in the summer, I decided to, with my toddler son, write a message back saying “be kind and stay curious” and leave it on the console table (edit: that is an asshole move). 

She also has an issue with our cat staying there and blames him for random stuff that he doesn’t do.  Edit to addd: the owner of the house, the dad, has never told us we couldn’t bring the cat. 

My husband’s father is a complete coward and when confronted stays silent but allows her to speak to his sons in awful ways. 

They are at the house now and she sent me a message berating me and my husband for bringing the cat which meant the dad having to vacuum (he’s been there multiple times since the cat and hasn’t said anything and when we stayed, we had a cleaning lady).

anyways, her message was extremely nasty and called me uneducated, selfish, and ill mannered for leaving the note and “snooping”. I didn’t snoop or look into her personal items. I simply put my makeup in the bathroom drawer.

,AmItheAsshole,"WIBTA - Allowing my parents to stay with my girlfriend and I?

I (27M) live with my girlfriend (28F) in a townhome I (100%) bought for about a year now. We have been together for eight years, four of them through college. Our relationship is healthy and we really don't have any issues until it's something she doesn't agree with (lol) typically regarding my parents.

I am someone that goes with the flow and does whatever I want in a respectable/compromising manner. My girlfriend is similar but has extreme OCD and control issues over situations. I get amused by how much it pains her that she doesn't have control or any info on a quick weekend getaway I sometimes surprise her with.

My parents recently just moved to NC, now being 9+ hours away, my girlfriend doesn't want them staying with us for a week to celebrate my sister's birthday and Christmas. She thinks they assume they are allowed to stay, which I believe is half true, truthfully I could care less. They will be traveling with the family dog which we all love and I so happen to just offer the best environment.

My parents are very laid back as well and try to stay out of our ways. They would 100% offer to cook dinner go on any errands (grocery store, etc.), do the laundry, or vacuum the house. My girlfriend has voiced her opinion, I listened and told her give me time to process so I dont say anything I regret. Ultimately she said, she is fine if they visit (1-3 days) whenever but I guess a week is too long as it disrupts her normal routine (typical work week). This argument doesnt apply in my opinion because we are off from work when they would be visiting. She doesn't want to give them the impression that if they visit they can stay with us.

My girlfriend's famous remark to disagreements regarding my parents is, ""my parents would never"". I told her early on when these arguments started that this does not involve your parents at all and if roles were reversed and your parents moved and were visiting I wouldn't care at all even though her mom would make both of us go shot for shot on a bottle every day. I feel like I suck it up and adapt to the current situation regarding her family events/gatherings, where she doesn't want to entertain it at all. Every situation and or even visit is different and requires communication. If I don't see it being a completely blatant issue I am fine with it.

Today's Events -

She asked my mom to stay in airbnb/hotel today without talking to me first or have me atleast tell them myself. Now I am in the middle of my mom not feeling wanted and my girlfriend's concerns. Family is family and I would do anything for mine and for hers regardless if I will dread it or not.

Would I be an asshole for just putting an end to the back and forth and just make the final decision to allow them to stay the whole week, having it be my townhome?

I want to propose early next year, but this issue is raising a red flag for me.

&lt;p&gt;My parents recently just moved to NC, now being 9+ hours away, my girlfriend doesn&amp;#39;t want them staying with us for a week to celebrate my sister&amp;#39;s birthday and Christmas. She thinks they assume they are allowed to stay, which I believe is half true, truthfully I could care less. They will be traveling with the family dog which we all love and I so happen to just offer the best environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents are very laid back as well and try to stay out of our ways. They would 100% offer to cook dinner go on any errands (grocery store, etc.), do the laundry, or vacuum the house. My girlfriend has voiced her opinion, I listened and told her give me time to process so I dont say anything I regret. Ultimately she said, she is fine if they visit (1-3 days) whenever but I guess a week is too long as it disrupts her normal routine (typical work week). This argument doesnt apply in my opinion because we are off from work when they would be visiting. She doesn&amp;#39;t want to give them the impression that if they visit they can stay with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend&amp;#39;s famous remark to disagreements regarding my parents is, &amp;quot;my parents would never&amp;quot;. I told her early on when these arguments started that this does not involve your parents at all and if roles were reversed and your parents moved and were visiting I wouldn&amp;#39;t care at all even though her mom would make both of us go shot for shot on a bottle every day. I feel like I suck it up and adapt to the current situation regarding her family events/gatherings, where she doesn&amp;#39;t want to entertain it at all. Every situation and or even visit is different and requires communication. If I don&amp;#39;t see it being a completely blatant issue I am fine with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#39;s Events -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She asked my mom to stay in airbnb/hotel today without talking to me first or have me atleast tell them myself. Now I am in the middle of my mom not feeling wanted and my girlfriend&amp;#39;s concerns. Family is family and I would do anything for mine and for hers regardless if I will dread it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would I be an asshole for just putting an end to the back and forth and just make the final decision to allow them to stay the whole week, having it be my townhome?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to propose early next year, but this issue is raising a red flag for me.&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"I, (20F) was invited to my high school friends birthday party (20F). Since about May of this year I had the date and time saved in my calendar which was October 19th at 7pm. I was helping her plan her cake, invitations and many other things, and lent her cocktail jugs and graze boards of mine for the party. 
In June of this year, i bought tickets to an event/concert with my other friend for the 26th of October, and after we bought the tickets, it is literally all we talked about we have been so excited for it.

On thursday the 10th of October, i saw the birthday girl for a catch up and to give her all the things im lending her for the party. When saying goodbye I said i’d see her next weekend for her party, and she said my party isn’t next weekend, it’s the weekend after. So I then realised that she had changed the date (and not let me know) to the date which i had this concert on. 
She did send out invitations a few days before that, however i didn’t think it was necessary to read it as I already had all the details in my phone, and had for many months! 

I was visibly upset and so disappointed that i was now in a very hard position and potentially had a to miss her party. 

She then called me a week later to ask if i had sold my ticket yet, and i told her that i had made the decision to go to this concert instead of her birthday, she was trying to come up with solutions for me to go to her birthday instead… saying she can pay me the amount that i paid for the ticket, or i could sell it to one of my friends other friends. 
She then ran out of solutions and got annoyed and ended the call. 

For the next two weeks leading up to the date of her party (26th october) she wasn’t answering any of my texts on any platforms and completely ghosted me. 

On the day of her party, i asked if she was home and got no reply. so i dropped her flowers, a makeup bag i sewed for her and bought all the makeup i did her practice bday makeup with, at her house (she lives 45 mins away)

She answered my text three hours later saying… “just got home, thank you.”

and has ghosted me again ever since. 

Additionally… her actual birthday isn’t even until mid November, and i told her i had another suprise planned for her since i couldn’t attend her party.

,AmItheAsshole,"I have a teenage daughter that is an overachiever and an adventurous. I'm proud of her. The issue is that she is far more expensive than her sisters. For context, she just had a school trip to Europe. Now she's wanting another. My spouse has over promised.I Have been having a back and forth with my spouse for a while, that they need to have a conversation with this child about expectations and our ability to pay. That hasn't happened yet, and I'm annoyed with the spouse. There are other expenses that this child has roped us into, promised to get a job and pay us back, but that's just not happening. Last time I brought it up the excuse was ""I'm just too busy. When am I going to have time to get a job with all of these extra-curiculars??""

So here's where the issue came to a head: Tonight I remembered about the some fees and I asked her for web address to to make payment. She cops an attitude and says she doesn't know. Okay I said I would make the payment when she provided me with more information. Que more attitude. Then my spouse pipes up, starts yelling that we received an email about this fee. He then tells me that I'm stupid and that he's going to take care of it. 

Now just to be fair, I have lost my cool and insulted my spouse in this way before. So what they said was hurtful but fair. But the child kept arguing with me and then said  ""this is why we don't like you"". That really effing hurt. 

So I have told the child that she needed to go to spouse for these things going forward, but I still fully expected for her to pay back the things she promised to pay back. The spouse says they're making payment, reiterates the same insult. At this point I am so over this. I tried to express my frustration and handling the mental load of the finances but they would not hear it. So I left the room.

Based on the amount deducted from our joint checking I believe my spouse messed up the registrations. Tomorrow is her deadline. So AITA for letting natural consequences unfold?

,AmItheAsshole,"My dad got in a pretty bad accident and was immediately sent to the ER. Immediately, my aunt (mum's lil sis) came and brought a bag filled with folded carpet and pillow. My uncle (mum's lil bro) also brought 2 bags filled with clothes. Ever since the beginning, I already told them not to bring too much stuff since it's the ER and my dad hasn't got admitted to a room yet and we still have to move around.

Two days ago, I stayed with my dad's bed alone at the ER. My mum and my aunt came in and put all of their bags in our cubicle. I told them not to put everything here because we were only at the ER, but they said they were just going to grab some lunch. There were about 2 big carrier bags of clothes, 1 bag of carpet and pillow, and two plastic bags of snacks. I also had my bag for my personal belongings. They never came back.

At some point, my dad had to be taken away for MRI, my mum went with him and left me alone. Not even five minutes later, a nurse came and told me that they're going to admit a new patient, so I had to take all of my stuff away. I was alone, stressed out, sad, worried, and now pissed, and it was hectic, so I had to carry 6 bags + my own bag to the waiting room by myself asap. And when I got there, my aunt was on her phone and just waved at me. She didn't even stand up to help. I was on the verge of crying so I vented it out, saying something like 'I said not to bring too much stuff!', and my voice might sounded harsh but I was frustrated. My aunt yelled back at me saying 'Don't you scold at me', I fell silent and cried silently. She left with her carpet and pillow after that.

A few minutes later my mum came back and told me my aunt texted my mum telling her to educate me about manners. I didn't care much about it because I wanted to focus on my dad.

I had to leave our bags unattended at the waiting room when my mum and I had to sign my dad's surgery so I texted my uncle to come and help with the bags. He asked about my aunt so I told him she got cranky and left because 'I scolded her'. My dumb uncle forwarded my texts to my aunt, and immediately after that, my mum's phone was bombarded with angry texts from my aunt. Because my mum was busy with the paperwork (and I know she was stressing out too) I took her phone and fired back. I had enough when she said “I had two appointments today, but I cancelled it because I wanted to help out at the hospital"". I chose not to reply.

My mum and I ended up apologising later that night through text. She didn't reply mine, but she did reply my mum's with more rants about how I was always a brat who yells at her parents all the time and never been taught manners, and how her son never raised his voice and hurt her feelings at all. Basically saying her son is better than me, and how her parenting is better than my mum's.

My other siblings take the bus home from school but J refuses to so it was my duty to pick her up, after school (3:00 PM) I got stuck in traffic for an hour (4:00 PM) finally when I got to pick up the cake I was exhausted and had gone home, when I entered the house my mom said ""Hi girls"" she was still cooking food and in an hour the family was going to arrive, I had gone into the kitchen and said ""Smells good"" she then asked me where J was and the realization hit me, I told my mom I had accidently forgot to pick up her and she blew up, I don't take people scolding me easily so when the guests arrived I had finished crying so I tried to act like everything was normal until my mom brought up how I left J at school for two and a half hours, I felt humiliated and my Grandma started telling me I was a terrible person, I thought my mom would defend me but she didn't, nobody did.

,AmItheAsshole,"In November 2023 (almost exactly 1 year ago) I (29F) was diagnosed with BPD1. I took the diagnosis really hard. I immediately got on a waitlist to start getting therapy and began taking medication to manage my symptoms. 
My significant other (let’s call him, Zack. 29M) was very understanding initially and also said that it made a lot of sense. He was very supportive the first month… or so. Then he would just use my diagnosis as the excuse for everything. Our fights, disagreements, why I did this, why he did that.
March of 2024, I finally made it to the top of the waitlist and got in to the therapy I desperately needed. A few sessions in and one thing my therapist recommended was getting a locking journal that I could write all of my most purely brutal and honest thoughts, feelings, triggers and so on in. Zack  encouraged this idea and thought it would be a healthy coping skill. I went straight to Amazon and found a decent quality leather journal with a lock that requires a 3 number code to unlock and ordered it. 
I used it for exactly what we had discussed me using it for. Unfiltered, raw, deep personal thoughts that I THOUGHT only I would ever read. For the last 7 months, Zack never once touched my journal…until last night. 
I was gone when he began blowing up my phone saying things like “We are fucking done, I hate you, I’m leaving the second you get home” and “I can’t believe you, you fucking disgust me” so on and so on. I was confused and started asking what the hell he was talking about and what happened. That’s when he tells me that he broke in to my journal and he read everything. 
Maybe it sounds silly but it made me feel so violated and exposed. I didn’t know what to do or even say. I definitely had moments in there that I know for a fact that I wrote some really messed up things about him, including one point where I questioned if I were falling out of love with him and possibly hated/resented him. These, again, were temporary thoughts/feelings that I wrote in moments of anger/sadness/confusion and I wholeheartedly thought that the only person who would ever read them, EVER, would be me, myself and I. I said those things to vent and get them off my chest and out of my head without negatively affecting or damaging my relationship. 
After I got home and tried to explain my side, it made no difference. His mind was made up and he told me he feels he “deserved to know the truth”. He is leaving me and he says it is solely my fault because of the things that I wrote about him in my journal.

,AmItheAsshole,"I don’t even know if I should bring it up but here’s the backstory.

I was visiting at my dad’s house yesterday. He received a phone call and stepped out of the room. I didn’t think anything of this because that is normal behavior for him (he’s a very secretive person).

He only stepped into a nearby room so I could still hear his responses. He told whoever he was talking to that his daughter was visiting and that he’d be able to call them later. After waiting for the other person to talk, he responded with “no… that’s not the case”. The other person talked for a few minutes and my dad responded with “I will call you around 5:30” and hung up. As he’s walking toward me, he puts his arm around my shoulder and pulls out his front camera as if he’s trying to take a selfie. I ask him what he’s doing and he responds “we don’t have any pictures together.” I find this odd but smile for the photo. I then say “actually we have one from when I lived with you a few years ago”. He responds with “yeah but we don’t have any recent photos”. 

The lighting was terrible, the angle was terrible, and overall it was not the time to randomly have a father-daughter photo shoot. We go down to his garage because he wanted my help with his car radio before that random phone call. As I’m getting into the passenger side, I see him text our new selfie to someone. He then puts his phone back in his pocket.

Am I overthinking or do these events seem strange? As a victim of abuse, I remember having to prove to my abuser who I was with and where. This seemed A LOT like that.

What should I do? My dad is a very secretive person and has a looooong history of lying. Is it possible he’s just dating someone and they already caught him in a lie and now they have trust issues? Or is he possibly in an abusive relationship with someone who is insanely controlling?

,AmItheAsshole,"This incident happened last week and I'm feeling pretty guilty about it, so I wanted to reach out to random internet strangers to see if my guilt is warranted or not.

A couple weeks ago I attended a wedding shower for my cousin. An old friend of hers (who we'll call Stacy) was there with her 10- month- old, and I had brought my 2- year- old.

We got to talking about mom stuff, and she mentioned that she had been taking her daughter to a weekly story time, hosted by a local business. She said that we should join them at the next one, that it would be nice to know someone there, and I agreed. We also added each other on Facebook.

The next story time day rolled around, and my daughter and I showed up to the venue a few minutes early. We found a seat on the floor near the front, and I did my best to entertain her while we waited.

The place quickly filled up with people, and I do mean filled up. We were soon squished shoulder to shoulder with parents and grandparents and kids. Stacy and her baby didn't arrive until about 15 minutes after the story was supposed to have started, and squeezed in next to us.

We continued to wait for another few minutes, and I mentioned the delayed start to Stacy. She responded, ""oh yeah, they always start late."" Which, like, thanks for the heads up.

At this point my daughter is absolutely not having a good time. Waiting around for 20 minutes in toddler time is like forever, especially when mom didn't come prepared for a wait.

Finally, they get the event going, and they start by listing all of the local businesses who helped sponsored the event. I'm trying to keep my daughter still and quiet, but other parents are letting their kids scream and run around, literally stepping on people.

The host then moved on to going over their event calendar for the rest of the year, and at this point I just couldn't take anymore. I leaned over to Stacy and told her that story time just wasn't a good fit for us, and we were going to leave. I told her to message me on Facebook if she wanted to set up a play date.

I wound up taking my daughter to the park instead, which is a better fit for her energy level.

Later that day, I saw that Stacy had made a post on Facebook that was getting a lot of attention. She talked about how hard it was to make mom friends, and how much she had struggled to get out and do things since her baby was born.

I felt pretty bad then. Like, she had really been looking forward to us hanging out and I had just bailed on her.

&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I attended a wedding shower for my cousin. An old friend of hers (who we&amp;#39;ll call Stacy) was there with her 10- month- old, and I had brought my 2- year- old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got to talking about mom stuff, and she mentioned that she had been taking her daughter to a weekly story time, hosted by a local business. She said that we should join them at the next one, that it would be nice to know someone there, and I agreed. We also added each other on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next story time day rolled around, and my daughter and I showed up to the venue a few minutes early. We found a seat on the floor near the front, and I did my best to entertain her while we waited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place quickly filled up with people, and I do mean filled up. We were soon squished shoulder to shoulder with parents and grandparents and kids. Stacy and her baby didn&amp;#39;t arrive until about 15 minutes after the story was supposed to have started, and squeezed in next to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued to wait for another few minutes, and I mentioned the delayed start to Stacy. She responded, &amp;quot;oh yeah, they always start late.&amp;quot; Which, like, thanks for the heads up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point my daughter is absolutely not having a good time. Waiting around for 20 minutes in toddler time is like forever, especially when mom didn&amp;#39;t come prepared for a wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, they get the event going, and they start by listing all of the local businesses who helped sponsored the event. I&amp;#39;m trying to keep my daughter still and quiet, but other parents are letting their kids scream and run around, literally stepping on people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The host then moved on to going over their event calendar for the rest of the year, and at this point I just couldn&amp;#39;t take anymore. I leaned over to Stacy and told her that story time just wasn&amp;#39;t a good fit for us, and we were going to leave. I told her to message me on Facebook if she wanted to set up a play date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wound up taking my daughter to the park instead, which is a better fit for her energy level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt pretty bad then. Like, she had really been looking forward to us hanging out and I had just bailed on her.&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"Here’s the situation: My fiancé (24) and I (24) plan to get legally married soon, with a larger celebration later on due to finances. His mother, who he hasn’t seen in over 10 years, lives in a village abroad where visiting is challenging, both because of travel restrictions and local religious customs that would prevent us from staying together. So, we decided to save up to bring her here for about a month after we get married/move out to our apartment, cover airport assistance for her, and take her to some places in the U.S. since it’s been so long.

A bit of background: She used to live in the U.S. with my fiancé’s dad, but after their divorce, she moved back to her home country with my fiancé. My fiancé’s dad eventually brought him back to the U.S. to live with his older sibling and go to school, as his mother didn’t prioritize his education (he had been living with her for over a year and was never enrolled in school). A couple of months after, his sibling and his wife had a baby, so his stay was no longer welcome at his house and was told to move out (age 17). Then my fiancé moved out on his own, working and going to high school at the same time to support himself. Since then, he’s been completely independent.

Now that he has saved enough to bring her over and offer a comfortable visit, he thought it was the perfect chance for a reunion. However, his mom says she won’t come unless she can stay for at least four months, and even rejected his offer to extend her stay to two months. We will be newly married, and I haven’t met her in person yet, on top of that, she is extremely religious, so it feels overwhelming to host her for so long. She also mentioned needing to settle things at home, like selling land, which makes us suspect she may plan to stay indefinitely.

She initially agreed to visit for a month before we got engaged, but now that our marriage and move-in date are set, she’s insisting on this longer visit. It breaks my heart to see how excited he was to finally be able to bring her here, but she pretty much gave him an ultimatum. If it is not at least 4 months, she won't come. I thought any mother would be excited to see her son after so long. 

I told him I do not want her staying for so long, especially since she is not giving us a valid reason for an extended stay, other than ""It doesn't make sense for her to come for JUST a month.""

Hi everyone, I’m in a bit of a tricky situation with a property near me, more so backing up to my back fence, and I could use some outside opinions. I live in an R1-zoned neighborhood, which is for single-family homes. Recently, a neighbor inherited a piece of land behind me, 3 acres. After moving a couple of mobile homes onto the property (30 feet off my fence line on the back of the acreage), they mentioned plans to add a third and also operate an in-home daycare in in of them (which is not illegal). I noticed that none of this was filed with the county assessor. Their mobile homes are 30 feet off my fence line at the back of their property budding to my back yard fence. According to the city ordinance the definition of Mobile Home Park: an officially approved unified development for two or more mobile homes spaces, arranged on a track of land under single ownerships. Checked with the county assessor and no paperwork has been filed and it still shows one person owning the 3 acres. A mobile home park can not be on R1 zoned land. 

I contacted the local code enforcement officer, who confirmed that multiple mobile homes aren’t allowed on an R1 property. However, I’m now stuck because the enforcement office doesn’t seem to be taking further action. I don’t want to be “that neighbor,” but I also don’t want to see the neighborhood’s appearance (and property values) impacted by this setup.

WIBTA if I escalate this to the city council or other higher-ups? Or should I just let it go? I wish I could add a picture so you could see how close they are to me. When I asked her why she put it down close to our fence line she just said “because she can” the land has not been deeded or subdivided. It’s one owners 3 acres. I have a meeting with an attorney, but am just curious if IATAH?

,AmItheAsshole,"I (31m) and my ex (30f) broke up a year ago. Every once in a while, I would message her, just asking how she was, what she’s been up to, etc. She, for some reason, did NOT like when I did this. So 2 months ago she called for no contact, blocking me on almost everything. I think this is unfair. I felt like me checking up on her, was not wrong for me to do. I don’t understand why she got upset with me for it.

Since I had no way of contacting her, I decided to use my best friend’s phone. He is very protective of his phone, so I know he wouldn’t allow me to use it. One night I managed to go into his room and take it. Now I know, this was not good of me to do, but I really needed to text my ex.

I managed to get into his phone. I knew his password was his birthday cuz he mentioned it a while back. When I started to put in my girlfriend’s phone number, I noticed that it was already in his phone. I thought that was strange, so I clicked on her contact and saw flirty messages between the both of them.

I felt distraught. How could my “friend” do this to me. 

I texted her saying it was me, and then I asked “how could you get with my best friend behind my back?” I said how it was unreasonable and just not fair to me. After I sent the message, my roommate caught me and started yelling at me, asking why I was on his phone in the middle of the night.

I yelled back, stating it was unfair for him to get with my ex and he should end it with her. He said no and snatched his phone back, telling me to get out. I just left, not wanting to start a fight. 

I went to the nearest IHOP to grab a cup of coffee and text my mom. I didn’t give her all of the details, just asking if I could stay for the night, she said yes.

The next morning I woke up to messages from my roommate. He was saying how he’s kicking me out of the apartment and to never attempt to contact him, nor my ex ever again. I feel like this isn’t fair. I’ve known both of them for years, how can they just do this to me?

&lt;p&gt;I yelled back, stating it was unfair for him to get with my ex and he should end it with her. He said no and snatched his phone back, telling me to get out. I just left, not wanting to start a fight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the nearest IHOP to grab a cup of coffee and text my mom. I didn’t give her all of the details, just asking if I could stay for the night, she said yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning I woke up to messages from my roommate. He was saying how he’s kicking me out of the apartment and to never attempt to contact him, nor my ex ever again. I feel like this isn’t fair. I’ve known both of them for years, how can they just do this to me? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, AITAH for wanting to text my ex?&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"Hi everyone,
I know this sounds so silly. Yesterday I purchased a bottle (a whole, normal sized bottle) of salad dressing for the meal I was planning to make. 
For context, I am the breadwinner in my household and buy almost all groceries, pay the mortgage, etc. I have a great relationship with my partner but I just can’t shake the fact that we had such a big disagreement over something so silly. 
Anyways, I’m pretty normal with how I dress my salad, so I know that the bottle would last me at least 1-2 weeks. We go to have our meal tonight and I see that the dressing is all gone. My feeling is that my partner has just plowed through something that I purchased in 24 hours. I find it kind of greedy and unnecessary. I brought this up with him - like, “hey, can you maybe try to use less salad dressing so that this can last longer?” 
It turned into a huge argument, where he laughed in my face and said that I was “breaking his balls over salad dressing.” 
I buy most of the groceries and have had this occur many times before. Things that I purchase disappear before I can even get to them. We’ve had this discussion before. He thinks I’m being absurd over caring about a few dollars worth of dressing, I’m trying to think big picture - like hello, we don’t need to plow through food goods like that especially when I’m the one buying them.

,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for wanting to still use a name I’ve loved for decades for my potential daughter (we are currently pregnant but keeping the gender a surprise) even though a very close friend just named her 9 month old that same name? 

About a year and a half ago before I even know our friends were trying to conceive we all had a discussion of what our baby names are. We both had the same #1 name  and ultimately ended the conversation with her saying there can be two kids with the same name and me saying good because I’m not changing it. (At the time I didn’t feel the need to express how long I’ve wanted the name) low and behold about a month later they pregnant and two months later they find out the gender and shout at the rooftops what the name is going to be. You guessed it…it’s the name we both wanted. 

Immediately I’m heartbroken but how am I suppose to tell someone in the middle of their pregnancy that I still want to use that name. Ultimately we don’t know if we’ll ever have a girl and I fully believe you can’t call dibs on a name. It’s just not fair. 

Well fast forward a couple months ago I’m 5 month pregnant and she now tells me I can’t use that name anymore. 

I just feel that it’s so unfair for her to go back on her word. And at the end of the day she knew we also wanted that name and it should have been a part of their decision process when naming their child. If it wasn’t, then our feelings weren’t really considered. 

My husband and I are just having such a hard time finding a new name and feel as though we’re having to settle. 

Long story short I still want to use the name I’ve wanted for forever, but I feel guilty for going that route. AITAH for leaning towards going with that name our friends just recently used? I just feel like one day I’ll regret not being able to use it. Like if I were to know we would end up here I would have been a whole lot more vocal about us still using the name.

Added thoughts:

We do live across the street from each other and this is a small town. Our children won’t be in the same grade at school but they will be in the same social circle. 

I also have a huge family and we have repeat names all over the place. I genuinely don’t think it’s weird and it’s the silliest thing to get worked up about someone using the same name as your child. 

We have been friends a lot longer than we have been neighbors. 

The heartbreak was less about her using the name and more about the worry of being put in the situation we are in now - her backing up and wanting us to choose a different name. I’m not upset she used the name - everyone has a right to a name. I am more heartbroken about potentially not being able to use the name.

,AmItheAsshole,"Friend A, let's call him Blorbus, is doing an important project that'll affect their chances of graduating and I've saved some stuff from my past project to sell to them (I really need the money for either rent or house repair, whenever they decide to pay gets the higher priority).

I bought these materials from another mutual friend of ours, Friend B (Elk). I barely used it though because I just bought it for insurance, in case I need to replace my own materials.

I finished my project last semester (Blorbus got delayed) and we, Elk and I, agreed that we would reserve the remaining materials to Blorbus since it'll be useful. I tried contacting Blorbus multiple times this past year if they're willing to get it (my place got flooded in and I need to clear more room in my place) but they either had an occasion going on or ghosted me. The one time we did interact, I stated the price of the materials and was willing to drop it off at school so it'll be cheaper for the both of us (courier fees are pretty pricy) and they never replied back.

A week ago, Elk chatted with me because Blorbus suddenly contacted them for the materials (despite me saying I had them the last we chatted). Elk decided to drop by my place and order a courier to deliver it to Blorbus instead (it was night and Blorbus lived pretty far). I thought it was weird because I could have done it myself. After chatting a bit more, I reached a realization that Elk and Blorbus had been chatting during the periods when I tried chatting and didn't know what to make of it.

We eventually decided to add it in and Elk told me they'll tell Blorbus about the price I placed. I didn't charge for the rest but only the particular materials that could technically pay for my rent next month (which was a lot less). 

Yesterday, I contacted Blorbus again to see how it was going and brought up the materials price. I told them they could pay it to me anytime but after a while they stopped chatting once again. I felt bad so I tried messaging them again the next morning to apologize and saw they blocked me. 

I haven't told Elk about it yet as I don't want to sour their mood, but was ITA for asking about the payment? I could have just sold it to someone else and gotten a lot more compared to the price I'm selling it to Blorbus (I was selling it at the same price Elk sold it to me a year ago and the material's price have shot up an additional 10% its former price) but I wanted to honor my agreement to Elk. 

Note: The materials I bought from Elk were non-perishables. So they had no expiration, they didn't deform (they do discolor if placed beside something that can cause discoloration) and can last for a really long time if not used.

B: ""But am I wrong?""

Me: ""Oh have you see the new Wynonna Earp Movie."" I'm desperately trying to change the subject.

B: ""Notice how she's not correcting me.""

Finally somehow we got off the topic and no one mentioned it after that.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (33F) am a single dog parent who is living in New England. Cost of living up here is much more expensive than I bargained for, so I am considering moving to a city in the Midwest where some of my best friends from grad school are moving as well after I get my license. That is still about a year out. It seems that the COL is much better there, I could seemingly work one job and be okay financially instead of the three I'm working here in order to make sure everything is covered.

On the face of it, makes total sense. The snag I'm running into is my mom. I love her very, very much but she is very difficult and has a lot of mental health issues that have really gotten her in trouble with her relationships and her employment. We have been pretty codependent and enmeshed for years, but I have been putting in a lot of work the past few years to break that cycle and set some boundaries so I can live my own life. She was raised by abusive parents who really didn't know how to love her and she never learned to love herself which has affected every relationship she's ever had. She is the biggest stress in my life, but I am the only one left in her life because she's alienated others and I don't think anyone deserves to be fully alone.

My little brother (31M) moved out of state, met his wife and is very happy there. I don't see him ever leaving there. My mom takes this super personally that he ran across the country to be away from her. He has learned to set those boundaries and, while he loves mom a lot, he knows there's nothing he can do for her and he is going to live his life.

My mom knows that I am considering moving about 16 hours from her (she's in the Mid Atlantic) and she's hurt because I was considering moving back to that area originally which would have made me only a few hours away from her. I realized that would not be as financially smart as moving to the midwest so I will not be going forward with that plan and so she is naturally disappointed.

I know she is emotionally manipulating me, knowingly or not (or both possibly), by talking about how she wants me to go because that is what is best for me, but she was upset when she mentioned she might move there (she's followed me to two different states at this point) and I didn't jump at the idea. She doesn't want me to not go just for her, but she sees everyone around her that is her age being surrounded by their kids and grandkids. She says its going to take her time to accept she's going to be alone for the rest of her life because ""once \[I'm\] gone, \[I'll\] never come back and that's okay"" so I need to be patient with her, but it kills me that she is being sentenced to that. I know it is her poor decisions and bad relationship skills that led her to not having the support system that she could have, but WIBTA for leaving her high and dry so I can finally live a life of my own?

,AmItheAsshole,"My husband Niko (29M) has always had a group of lads that he's friends with - he goes to play football with them every Thursday, goes out for drinks after and whatnot, as well as them having an annual lads trip in November time. They go to a different city for a weekend, do a lot of drinking and eating, and then come back. I (26F) have never had a problem with this because I know he's not going to do anything dodgy and I also know he likes having time with his friends. 

Plus, I know all of them, and they're good guys. I've never worried about it too much. The difference this year is that I'm currently 36 weeks pregnant and he's planning to go on the trip this coming weekend. I told Niko that I'm uncomfortable with him going away at this point in time, because I'm at a point where anything could happen, and I don't want to be left alone if I go into labour early. And as well as that that, I'd just rather him be at home with me for support in case anything does happen.

Niko says that it's the only time of the year that he gets to unwind with his friends and that it's tradition. He says that he'll have his phone on him the whole time and they're only going to a city about an hour's drive away this year so he can be back quickly if I needed him to be here. 

I understand the trip is important to him but I'm anxious about the idea of him being away. The thought of potentially going through labour alone or having a medical emergency without him here scares me. I've suggested that he could skip this year, but he's frustrated and feels like I'm being unfair because the chance of anything happening is low.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (31f) have met my person who I'll call Matt (27m), and we decided to get married. Some back story I have never cared about big celebrations or poufy dresses, and I really don't see the need to spend thousands on a party. Matt understands my thoughts, but we have different family histories. My parents had a courthouse wedding, but the marriage was half toxic and ghosting but loving when they decided to be a family. While Matt was raised in the common 2 parent upper middle-class household. We have lived very different lives with different values and experiences. We met through my niece which was weird at first because he came to pick up his niece from a sleepover, but I didn't know him, and I wasn't letting this girl go with a stranger. After everything was confirmed and settled things just went from there. I'm very introverted and he's extroverted so we started friendly then got friendlier and he proposed. Now you would think we would have problems with our families with our differences, things that include skin tone, but everything managed to fall into place. My biggest fear was my brothers and cousins wouldn't like him being that I'm the only girl and youngest of 5 and all my brothers and cousins are bulky and tall. So, I walked him into meeting the crazy that is my family, and they hit it off (thank you anime and gaming). Meeting his family felt weird and different to me but they are the nicest people that I can see so far.

Now to my problem I don't have the best view on marriage, and I have always been careful with money so I don't see why we can't just go to the courthouse then have a family barbeque to celebrate. At first Matt was on my side saying we could use that money to buy a house or go on a honeymoon and everything was fine. Then we started telling everyone the plan and now everyone has an opinion and none of them are what I want. Matts mom who well call Debra wants her son to have a church wedding with their pastor like her eldest son did. I'm religious but not to the point of wanting a church wedding. My mom we can call DeeDee wants me to have a wedding because she didn't have one. I kind of expected this from her because she wanted me to go to prom and made it happen when originally, I wasn't going. She still brings this up and she used this very scenario to prove she's right about the wedding. Now her and Debra have started planning a wedding and have convinced Matt that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity now they all have been bombarding me to change my mind. I'm not even planning a wedding, and this is stressing me out to the point I might not want to get married. So AITAH for wanting to just get married without all the fuss?

Edit: What I said about my brothers was to point out that I am the youngest and slightly spoiled and my brothers have always had my best interest in mind.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (45f) have 3 kids, Hannah (15f), Hayden (12m), and Hunter (9m).

We also offer money for extra chores as long as it's been agreed on beforehand. .

  
One of the boys brought home a stomach bug and passed it onto the other. Hannah and I luckily haven't been affected. Obviously I can't have them doing chores when they're sick so I had Hannah do them for them. She cleaned their bathroom, their room, and even fed Hayden's gecko (which was begrudgingly as she hates bugs). I guess she got the idea that this would count as extra chores and asked me for money after she did all the chores. I told her no because she was expected to do those chores anyway. She threw a hissy fit and said how it wasn't fair because they're not her chores to begin with, and said how I would've paid Hayden and Hunter if they did it. I said that it's different because she's their older sister so she'll naturally have more responsibility than them. She got mad at me and refused to do her own chores so I took away her devices and canceled a girls day out we were supposed to go on for the weekend.

I said that it&amp;#39;s different because she&amp;#39;s their older sister so she&amp;#39;ll naturally have more responsibility than them. She got mad at me and refused to do her own chores so I took away her devices and canceled a girls day out we were supposed to go on for the weekend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was talking about this with some other parent friends and got mixed reactions from them. I wanted to see what the concensus would be here. AITA?&lt;/p&gt;

While my dad has tried to reach out, my brother has blocked him, so I’ve often found myself in the middle, passing messages between them and having to be present when they meet upon request from them. 

My brother and sister-in-law are hosting a culturally significant birthday party for their son soon. We’ve all been helping in different ways to make this event special. However, while my brother has invited all of our mom’s side, he’s excluded our dad, as our mom and her family aren’t comfortable being around him.

Recently, my dad has been messaging me, asking when we can go together to visit his grandson. Every time he asks, I feel guilty that he doesn’t know about the party. This occasion holds deep cultural meaning for him too. I realize it’s not my place to share this information since it’s not my son, but constantly keeping this from him feels dishonest and somewhat disrespectful.

While my dad has tried to reach out, my brother has blocked him, so I’ve often found myself in the middle, passing messages between them and having to be present when they meet upon request from them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother and sister-in-law are hosting a culturally significant birthday party for their son soon. We’ve all been helping in different ways to make this event special. However, while my brother has invited all of our mom’s side, he’s excluded our dad, as our mom and her family aren’t comfortable being around him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, my dad has been messaging me, asking when we can go together to visit his grandson. Every time he asks, I feel guilty that he doesn’t know about the party. This occasion holds deep cultural meaning for him too. I realize it’s not my place to share this information since it’s not my son, but constantly keeping this from him feels dishonest and somewhat disrespectful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. I know my brother would invite him if our mom were okay with it, but he’d rather have our mom’s side there than our dad’s.

,AmItheAsshole,"Hi! So my parents divorced 8 years ago due to my dad cheating on my mum. The divorce was messy and took years to be finalised.

Hey Reddit,

I (23F) have been talking to a guy for a few weeks now. We’re not dating. He’s been very sweet and attentive, always checking in on me, sending good morning/goodnight messages, etc.

Today, he sent me a message asking, “When do you finish studying?” I thought he was checking in on me or maybe about to say something cute, so I replied with, “Why? What do you want from me? 🙄” I meant it as a playful response and was kinda hoping he’d respond with something like, “I missed you.”


The thing is, he knows I joke around a lot, so I didn’t think anything of it. But he didn’t take it that way this time. He got pretty upset and replied with:


	•	“I don’t understand?”
	•	“I just wanted to check up on you, why are you talking like that?”
	•	“Did I say anything wrong for you to act this way?”
	•	“I just said we didn’t talk today.”

I sent him a voice note explaining that I was just trying to be playful, but he still seemed hurt and defensive. Now I’m wondering if I crossed a line. I thought it was a lighthearted response, but his reaction makes me feel like I may have accidentally offended him.

,AmItheAsshole,"Throwaway because I dont want this tied to me.

Hi im a 14F kid with an 18M half brother. We live with our mother 36F who is currently pregnant with another child. Our fathers both suck and aren't all that present in our lives. Me and my brother are both severely autistic as well but are on opposite ends of the spectrum.

For some context my mother purposely decided to have a kid that looks like her long term ex boyfriend after a chemical pregnancy she had with him. They broke up not too long ago and still talk a lot. I actually don't know if they are together anymore, its that bad. She had a kid with this guy who I said was definitely in some shady business and my mother ignored that bit what do you know I was correct. So we have to worry about the baby daddy now even though I told her not to tell him in the first place. Shes going to finally take my advice and lie to him saying that she miscarried but he follows her on facebook. More issues to be had is that my brother has severe anger issues. He has broken several monitors and controllers, which would definitely wake up a newborn baby. He also doesn't want a mixed race child in the family and this baby would be a mixed race child. No he isnt aware of it. I think I should say that my childhood was confusing and still is. All im going to say is, barricading my door to keep her from entering after every argument whilst she jammed her arms and legs through the doorframe was not fun. But she did spoil us rotten on birthdays nad Christmas and played dolls with me so... but she did destroy  the one sentimental dollhouse I had because I was going through a mental breakdown... Do you see my confusion?

I would love another sibling. I would love to be an older sister. However, we cannot afford another child right now. My mother is wracked with stress trying to parent me and my brother. This kid is guaranteed to be autistic so how on earth will she cope? I understand she has wants another kid but this is absurd. She thought the kid would bring her long term ex boyfriend back. It will not do that. It seems like she has planned for me to do most of the raising especially when the kid is older. After all she is more interested in raising when the kid is younger. Once they reach a certain age they just aint fun anymore. She is hoping for twins. Maybe even triplets. We live in a rented 3 bedroom house. Unless the cupboard under the stairs is turning into a bedroom I dont think we even have the space for another child.

So thats why I just want to talk to her about this.

Thats why I have to ask. Reddit, Will I be the asshole?

&lt;p&gt;Hi im a 14F kid with an 18M half brother. We live with our mother 36F who is currently pregnant with another child. Our fathers both suck and aren&amp;#39;t all that present in our lives. Me and my brother are both severely autistic as well but are on opposite ends of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some context my mother purposely decided to have a kid that looks like her long term ex boyfriend after a chemical pregnancy she had with him. They broke up not too long ago and still talk a lot. I actually don&amp;#39;t know if they are together anymore, its that bad. She had a kid with this guy who I said was definitely in some shady business and my mother ignored that bit what do you know I was correct. So we have to worry about the baby daddy now even though I told her not to tell him in the first place.

,AmItheAsshole,"I'm in a friend group with three other girls, I'll call them Ann, Sophy and Marta. About a few months ago it was the birthday of Sophy, usually for birthdays we buy a gift the friend group together, I am usually in charge of buying the present, for this one though I was in holidays to another country, so I told Ann and Marta to take care themselves of the gift, and once I'm back they tell me how much money I ought them.

The thing is that they didn't get her any gifts, and Sophy is still mad about it. I don't know if my friends thought I would take care of the gift once I'm back, or that they believe that some fries is a good gift, anyway I didn't feel like buying her a gift, if they had arranged it I would have paid my part, but I didn't want to organize it, mostly because she isn't really nice to me, she bragged about not contributing to my birthday gift (Which they did give me over a month late), I'm tired of being the one in charge of it, she owes me money, and I don't like her.

The thing is, since then there have been both Ann and Marta's birthday, for the Ann's, me and Marta gifted her a book, I didn't want to ask Sophy if she wanted to participate in the gift, but Marta wanted to do it, so I let her, Sophy obviously didn't want to, we gave the gift in front of Sophy, Ann assumed It was from the three of us, and Sophy didn't correct he, so I told Ann that the gift was only from me and Martha. Now Marta's birthday is in two days and me and Ann have bought her a gift, once again I didn't want to tell Sophy, Ann did anyway and Sophy didn't even answer the text. We will give her the gift, next Saturday, the problem is that Sophy will also be there.

The incident happened today when I missed a shift for day shift. Now, the schedule gets posted on the board every Monday, well when I worked this past Monday I didn’t see the new schedule, only the previous one. I figured because I had a set schedule and because I was night shift that it would be the same as before, right? Wrong, they had apparently scheduled me as the ONLY cook for morning shift. Now , this is a simple mistake right? It can be solved with a simple call or text. Wrong again, despite the fact that my number is in the office along with everyone else’s, no one thought to call me. So, when I arrived I got fussed out by the assistant manager, and when I finally realized what had happened, I tried to explain and apologize because I did feel really bad about them having to cover me. I was trying to explain to her, “There was a mix up, I feel terrible about this.” Only for her to snap and be like, “Well, I’ve felt terrible for 2 two weeks and I’m still here.” Before storming off. I had already had bad experiences from this manager and how rude she could be over simple questions and such so safe to say I was upset by this.

Well, the other manager (a shift manager), came over to talk to me and I thought that because she was the more level headed of the management team that we would have a normal, adult conversatio. Wrong yet again, she proceeded to talk down to me like “You’re an adult, it is not our job to remind you when you’re supposed to work.” I didn’t say that it was, and when I reminded her that they had my phone number and could have called when I didn’t show up and easily sort out the mistake, she rolled her eyes at me and asked if I was working the night shift or not.

,AmItheAsshole,"I'm (42) dating Tim (59), a widower. He's in banking, I'm a bartender. I know what it looks like. His 2 daughters thought the same thing, but he's broke as a joke and I've got a trust fund, so actually no.  
  
He's broke because his late wife got cancer. 3 times. He ran up 6 credit cards, 2^(nd) mortgage on the house, cashed out his retirement, everything and anything to get her the treatment she needed and then to get treatment enough to see both daughters married.  
  
His daughters live 6hrs drive away.  
  
We drove to them for Xmas last year and the year before. They ignored me, dragged Tim away when he tried to include me and prevented their husbands from making even small talk with me by talking over me.  
  
Year 1 Tim chastised them, they apologized (to him, not me) They blamed the pain of seeing their Dad with a woman who wasn't their Mum.  
Year 2, they did it again.  
  
This year I told Tim not again.  
He could go, I would never ask him not to see his daughters for Xmas but I'll stay here.  
  
Tim didn't love the idea because me going with him means we can share the responsibility of driving when his back starts to bother him. (He hates to fly)  
His 2010 deathtrap is starting to go anyway, so I leased him a comfy luxury ride (my brother has a dealership)  
  
He called the girls, super excited that he'd be able to see them more often without having to worry about his back,, who then blew up and accused him of spending their Mothers money on a “bull\*\*\*\* house and car to impress some bimbo bartender and didn't offer them a dime for their weddings”  
  
In the ensuing argument it came out that they assumed there had been a life insurance policy, nor did they have any idea about the credit card debt or the 2^(nd) mortgage that the house was underwater on or that Tim was looking at foreclosure and bankruptcy until he moved in with me.  
  
They did not realize it was my house, that he pays no bills save the water bill (man takes excessive showers) and shared groceries.  
  
Now the girls want my number. They are sorry I “felt lonely” at Xmas.

They want to come visit and stay with us next year! Conveniently in summer, I live near a beach.  
  
I've told Tim absolutely not about giving out my number. I'm happy to be polite if they come to visit Tim but, we're not going to be friends. If they had talked to me for even 2 seconds they'd have understood. I am not shy about admitting the only thing I have ever contributed to my blessed financial state is “not developing a crippling coke addiction” like my cousin Danny did.

  
Tim thinks I'm being too unforgiving. They would have warmed up to me eventually but knowing how generous I am being with their Father has made them warm up quicker.

His 2 daughters thought the same thing, but he&amp;#39;s broke as a joke and I&amp;#39;ve got a trust fund, so actually no.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s broke because his late wife got cancer. 3 times. He ran up 6 credit cards, 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; mortgage on the house, cashed out his retirement, everything and anything to get her the treatment she needed and then to get treatment enough to see both daughters married.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His daughters live 6hrs drive away.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drove to them for Xmas last year and the year before. They ignored me, dragged Tim away when he tried to include me and prevented their husbands from making even small talk with me by talking over me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year 1 Tim chastised them, they apologized (to him, not me) They blamed the pain of seeing their Dad with a woman who wasn&amp;#39;t their Mum.&lt;br/&gt;

When I got home around 5:30pm, my older daughter had already made herself one box of Mac &amp; Cheese. The plan for dinner was Mac &amp; Cheese and hotdogs anyway, so I cooked a package of hotdogs and waited to see if I needed to cook more Mac &amp; Cheese.

All of us ate, and there was half a hotdog and a couple of bites of Mac &amp; Cheese left when we were done.

Before I could clean up my wife called to say she was on her way home. I told her that we just finished eating, and that the food was gone, and asked what she wanted to eat. She said she would cook something for herself when she got home. I asked if she was sure, and she said yes.

When she got home she was very upset with me because I didn't cook enough for everyone. I offered to cook more Mac &amp; cheese and hotdogs, but she said no, and continued telling me that I was socially inept and that I didn't understand and I should have made more food. AITA?

,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for Telling My Best Friend She Needs a Backup Plan?

Alright, this has been eating at me, and I need some outside perspective.

My best friend (let’s call her Sarah) has dreamed of being an actress since we were kids. She’s incredibly passionate about it and talks all the time about how she’s going to “make it big.” Here’s the thing, though—Sarah is 28 now, and she hasn’t actually gotten anywhere close to that dream. She’s done a few small gigs here and there, like local theater, but nothing even remotely close to what she’s aiming for. She’s also still working a retail job to pay her bills.

I love her, and I want to see her succeed, but recently, I’ve started to feel like she’s putting herself in a really tough spot. We were chatting the other day, and she was going on about an audition for some indie project that pays very little. I told her, “Sarah, I’m so proud of you for sticking with it, but don’t you think it’s time to have a backup plan? Maybe something stable?”

She got super defensive and said I was being unsupportive and didn’t believe in her. I tried to explain that I just want her to be realistic and financially stable because it hurts to see her struggle so much. She then said I was being negative and basically told me I don’t get it because I’ve always had a stable career path.

Now, some of our friends are split on this. A few think I was out of line, saying that I should just be supportive and let her chase her dream. Others say I was just looking out for her, being the voice of reason. I’m genuinely torn here.

,AmItheAsshole,"So my (f, 27) friend, Sam (f, 25) sublet my flat for 10 days while I was traveling.    

The situation worked well as Sam was moving back to our city for a job she was about to begin &amp; needed a place asap. I was set to travel for 10 days upon her arrival so I offered her to sublet my flat for £150 which is a great deal in the city I live in. (Usually it's 300 or more for where we live for 10 days.)

The issue is on the last day of the sublet she invited her boyfriend over around 11pm &amp; they had loud sex at 2am for about an hour. My roommate was going to the funeral of a close friend in the morning which he had told Sam about. After hearing them for awhile, my roommate slammed on the door &amp; asked Sam to talk down in the kitchen. Once there, my roommate screamed for her to “get the fuck out” &amp; was livid at her “fuck boy” (her boyfriend). Sam goes upstairs &amp; starts packing with her boyfriend &amp; they call an Uber to go to his flat. My roommate is still yelling once they come downstairs &amp; says that Sam is a “disgrace.”  

I’m abroad and wake up the morning of my flight home to texts from Sam briefly saying what happened. Obviously my immediate concern was for Sam &amp; her boyfriend as it seemed like they were put in a horrible situation by my roommate, and obviously my roommate should've just asked them to stop instead of overreacting &amp; creating this whole mess. We (Sam, myself, and her boyfriend) all talked on the phone while I was at the airport &amp; they explained everything to me. 

Once I was back at my flat, I talked to my roommate for a few hours. I told him his behaviour was inappropriate and he agreed but said he felt very disrespected by Sam as she knew he had a funeral in the morning &amp; was having loud sex for over an hour at 2am. 

Now, Sam believes that she should pay £100 instead of £150 because she was kicked out of the flat at 2am &amp; the Uber to her boyfriends flat was apparently £50. (Side note: there is public transport that would’ve cost much less but taken longer). I believe she should pay the whole £150 as I already gave her a great deal for a 10 day sublet out of respect for her &amp; her housing situation &amp; she was there for the 10 days until that morning.

also, my sister has really been wanting to go to school with me (we apply the same year) and she'll probably be pissed at me after this, and hate me.

I got backlash for this already, just for insinuating i was thinking about it, but this was a year or two ago.

It's not a distance issue if i go to the college my sister going to... but i don't feel like going to school with her for my own reasons, and i don't want to live at home during my college years. I wanna go further, so distance IS an issue, therefore I won't have to be home so often.

i want to apply to a college that's a city or two away from where i live, and have a fresh chapter in my life.

also no, i wont be relying on my parents to pay for my housing if i do end up moving out.

also, my sister has really been wanting to go to school with me (we apply the same year) and she&amp;#39;ll probably be pissed at me after this, and hate me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got backlash for this already, just for insinuating i was thinking about it, but this was a year or two ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a distance issue if i go to the college my sister going to... but i don&amp;#39;t feel like going to school with her for my own reasons, and i don&amp;#39;t want to live at home during my college years. I wanna go further, so distance IS an issue, therefore I won&amp;#39;t have to be home so often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i want to apply to a college that&amp;#39;s a city or two away from where i live, and have a fresh chapter in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also no, i wont be relying on my parents to pay for my housing if i do end up moving out.&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"So to give a little background information.

A week before my 21st my best friend (let's name her Sarah) decided to buy 2 Scooter Tickets and because Sarah (21 y/o) had a spare ticket she said she would take me, but wouldn't let me pay for my ticket so I told her to make it for my birthday. So that was fine until...

A week before we were meant to be going Sarah messaged me and I quote ""Hey are you still going next week or are you busy?"" which I responded ""Yes I'm still going"". I was thinking why would I be going somewhere when I already made plans to go to Scooter with her originally for my birthday.

So a day before we were meant to be going to the concert she then messaged me with ""Everyone is wearing Halloween costumes so I'm wearing mine"" But by this time I was working that day and because I work with kids I was going to wear a Halloween costume, but was planning on bringing some nice clothes to change into for this concert and i didnt want to wear the same costume i wore to work to the concert and didnt have another costume to change into for the concert..Then a whole conversation happened...

She then stated ""Ok if your not in the mood it’s fine it’s a Halloween thing it’s on a week day n don’t want u to be tired my auntie was looking to buy a ticket so if u do t want to dress up she was looking to buy one"". So I was thinking WTF to which I responded with ""I was wanting to go but not wanting to dress up if you want to go with your auntie then you can take her"" as it sounded like she wanted to take her auntie just because I wasn't dressing up..

Sarah stated ""i wanted you to dress up with me but at the same time I don't want you to feel ""uncomfortable"" for being the only one who wasn't dressed up"" which I wasn't uncomfortable with and stated that to her beforehand. 

She wanted to arrange a night out at the weekend to make it upto me. But I don't know what to do.

Edit: She also had the full day to get her hair/makeup and stuff done before hand as she didn't have work that day wither as if I did have another costume I would still have my makeup and stuff to do while in work as I work till 4pm (which she already knew) and doors opened at 6pm (it takes about 1 hour to get there)

,AmItheAsshole,"This is such a stupid situation but alas
| (28F) have a longtime friend, “Lena” (29F).

We've known each other since middle school. Had our ups and downs but things have been fine overall.
Lena's life isn't super easy. She had her first child, “Maya”, at 16 and had a couple more before she was 24. I'm the godmother of the younger 2 but not Maya since I was so young when she was born. Still, I love Maya to death and l've always been like an aunt to her.

Lena has financial issues and I try to help whenever I can. I don't charge to babysit, if I have extra money, 'll buy them a few groceries, etc. I try to do what I can financially but I'm not rich myself so it's not always a lot. Lena also asks me for help A LOT, though, and I give what I can because I don't want my godchildren going without, even when it puts me in uncomfortable financial situations.

Anyway, Maya feels she's getting a little too old to always be playing with her younger siblings so l've started taking her out with me on various outings on Saturdays. Over the past few years, Lena has started getting Maya into modeling and influencing. It was a slow start but she's a super cute kid and things are starting to pickup. She knows Maya and I have this standing ""date"" for a few hours every Saturday.

Lena came to me this morning to talk about this upcoming weekend. Apparently, things are really starting to take off for Maya. Lena has already had to turn down quite a few shoots/gigs/whatever because she wanted to be considerate of our bonding time. But she says that's no longer feasible because they’re starting to pay more. She doesn't, however, want our time together to stop, necessarily. She just wants me to pay her the money Maya would be missing out on if she could've had a gig that day. The one she can book this weekend is apparently $400?
I won't lie. I laughed in her face at first. I thought it was some weird joke, like ""you know, you're dealing with a future superstar"" or something. But no, she was dead serious.

She wants me to pay for the luxury of hanging out with Maya. The conversation basically ended with the title.

AITA for being so rude to her?

Update: I talked to Maya during her lunch break at school today, as someone pointed out that Lena may pretend to be her if I texted her while she was at home. It wasn’t a long discussion. Maybe 15 minutes because they technically aren’t supposed to use their phones in school and she had to go to the bathroom to call me during lunch.

Soooo there is a gig for $400 on Saturday BUT Maya got passed up for it. It came down to her and another girl and they got the call two evenings ago (so right before the morning Lena and I spoke) letting them know they went with someone else. The gig was never Maya’s to turn down and she’s never had another job that would’ve interfered with our Saturdays. So you all were right. This went beyond just making an outrageous request.

Not gonna lie, I’m pretty furious. Maya was so upset that her mom would lie about something like that to get money from me. She apologized a ton but I told her it wasn’t her fault and that I’m not mad at her.

I’m taking her trick or treating tonight. I’m gonna tell her then that I can’t be around her mom right now but still love her and will always be there when she needs me. I’m gonna give her a few methods of contacting me when she needs because I’m sure her mom will be super petty after I tell her that I’m taking a step back from our friendship for the foreseeable future.

A few things for those who brought up valid concerns.

1. I did ask Maya about the nature of these gigs. Everything is on the up and up. She said her mom never leaves her alone with anyone and is actually pretty good at making sure she’s comfortable when taking photos. I did tell her to let me know if this ever changes.
2. As far as Maya knows, her mom has never tried to charge anyone else to spend time with her. I’m guessing she just tried this scheme out on me to see if she could get away with it.

&lt;li&gt;As far as Maya knows, her mom has never tried to charge anyone else to spend time with her. I’m guessing she just tried this scheme out on me to see if she could get away with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m bummed but I know y’all are right. This relationship hasn’t been healthy for me and I now see that I’ve been allowing myself to be used. That ends today.&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"Edited to take out my judgment of how I feel about her son. It does not pertain to the issue.

I (mid-40sF) work at a very small business. We have 4 employees including myself, the owners (husband &amp; wife), and their daughter. The daughter (April 30F) has a 9-year-old son and as of right now she leaves early every day and works from home a few hours after her son gets out of school. This came about because she never got her son on the afterschool program list to be enrolled and by that time it was too late. This was the third time (she failed to do so in his previous school years) she missed signing him up because she never made it a priority. And she doesn't want to pay for an after-school sitter to come pick him up and watch him til 5 every day.

I have been at this job just over 12 years and the owners have only owned the business for 3 years. I never call in sick and mostly take planned days off. I will occasionally come in on a Thursday and ask for Friday off and have never had an issue. I get 4 weeks of paid vacation a year and we are allowed to carry over a week. So beginning of this year I had 5 weeks. Another thing to note is if we take off a whole day we have the option to use as much PTO as we want. There were a few days I took a whole day off and only used 4 hours of PTO. So at this time of the year I still have enough PTO to carry over a week and still have 6 days left to use or else I lose those hours. So I want to take the week of Christmas off and that would land when her kid has no school. So she will either have to take off, bring in him, or leave him with a great grandma whose health isn't the best.

The thing is she never plans for anything. April just figures she will figure it out once the time comes around and then complains if she has to stress about where her kid is going to be. Or I will hear from her mom (my other boss) questioning why I am taking off. IMO that isn't my problem. She knows her son's school schedule and she can plan ahead and ask for days off. She just chooses not to.

And to clarify I can't take another week off. Come now til Christmas we will be slammed with orders. These last few months are our busiest and I am the main person running the machinery and assembling the projects.

A week ago, while I was walking to her house, I was carrying her aipods in my pocket. Then they fell and i picked them up.

Next morning, she tells me that I forgot to put the airpods back on the case, and that her dad ran over them while leaving for work in the morning.

I ask if she wants me to buy new ones, and she says yes since i broke them. This response angered me a bit since i really did not think she would expect me to replace them.

Then i ask her why is she making me pay for them and presented 4 arguments on why i shouldn't:

1. I always take her on tons of dates that costed me alot of money.
2. She once borrowed my pocket camera for a trip and as she borrowed it to a friend he droped and dinged it making it lose a bunch of resale value as i was going to sell it.
3. She currently owes me 50 bucks.
4. She dinged my car door one day and it is a $300 dollar fix approx, and she said that she wouldn't do anything to fix it.

Her response to each was the following:

2. She said that since it was not broken and it technically was not her who damaged it it is not her fault.
3. She said she will pay those off soon.
4. She asked if I have gone to fix it, to which I said no, to which she says then why am I bringing it up.

,AmItheAsshole,"
Hi, I (31M) am going through a tough time in my marriage, partly due to learning about the strained relationship between my wife (34F) and her mother. My mother-in-law (MIL) has significant mental health issues, and I’ve witnessed her treating my father-in-law with shocking disrespect—she often ignores him, leaving everyone in silence, as if trapped in an invisible standoff. Once, when my wife begged her mother to speak to us, she stood silent, unmoved. I was baffled by this behavior, wondering what I’d gotten myself into.

There have been multiple instances where my MIL, in a flash, cuts off contact over trivial disagreements, leaving her daughter to deal with the pain. Once, when her parents visited us from abroad, she locked herself in a room after an argument, demanding to be flown back home, which we reluctantly did. Later, I learned from my wife that this on-off behavior has been part of her entire life; her mother alternated between being loving and cruel. I started to feel that my wife hadn’t been fully honest with me about her mother’s mental health and their dysfunctional family dynamic, which seemed hidden behind a facade when we were dating.

This secrecy has affected our marriage. I’ve noticed some behavior patterns in my wife that echo her mother’s—expecting me to endure hardship without acknowledgment, much like her father does.

I needed someone to talk to, so I confided in my brother about these issues half a year ago. The conversation is a bit blurry now, but it helped me sort through my emotions, as my brother was also facing some challenges. Recently, though, my MIL resurfaced with a message accusing my wife of being a bad daughter for not visiting while we were in her country. She even falsely claimed to have cancer. This rekindled the pain for my wife, who was upset by her mother’s accusation and manipulative tactics. I then discovered that my mother had been in contact with my MIL and had even shared personal details about our lives with her.

Just today, I was chatting with my brother about our family, and he casually mentioned that my mother had asked him about our holiday plans and whether we'd be visiting my in-laws, something she could’ve asked me directly. When I shared this with my wife, she became extremely upset, asking if I’d shared details about her mother with my brother. I explained that I do talk with him about issues affecting me personally, but she felt betrayed, leading to a huge argument.

I reassured my wife that during my recent call with my brother, we hadn’t even discussed her family issues. However, I also told her that, as her husband, I need support and the freedom to talk with someone close when dealing with situations impacting my mental health—especially given that I feel misled about her family’s issues.

This entire experience, plus my own family dynamics between me and our mother, has made me reflect on my upbringing in what now feels like a cult-like environment, but that's a different story. I want a peaceful and happy marriage, but with all this deception and secrecy, I’m starting to question if we’re truly compatible, and whether it would best to move on. 

So, AITA for speaking with my brother about my wife’s difficult family situation, which she kept from me for so long?

I explained that I do talk with him about issues affecting me personally, but she felt betrayed, leading to a huge argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reassured my wife that during my recent call with my brother, we hadn’t even discussed her family issues. However, I also told her that, as her husband, I need support and the freedom to talk with someone close when dealing with situations impacting my mental health—especially given that I feel misled about her family’s issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entire experience, plus my own family dynamics between me and our mother, has made me reflect on my upbringing in what now feels like a cult-like environment, but that&amp;#39;s a different story. I want a peaceful and happy marriage, but with all this deception and secrecy, I’m starting to question if we’re truly compatible, and whether it would best to move on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, AITA for speaking with my brother about my wife’s difficult family situation, which she kept from me for so long? Should she be able to dictate that I don’t discuss this with anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"Hey y'all, I'm in a bit of a moral bind and need help. For context on me, I have a remote job that let me move back where I'm from, which has been nice for a few different reasons, one that it's allowed me to spend time and get closer with my parents who still live there. This job also has allowed me some flexibility to work in other cities (and even countries on occasion with their permission), which I have been trying to take advantage of.

Since I started moving around more, I've been the happiest I've ever been in my life, and as a result, I've been gone often, ensuring I am home for the important moments, holidays and if I'm ever needed. I try to keep up relationships with those at home but my parents are awful at communicating. I call them at least once a week and rarely if ever will hear from them when I am not home. I always keep up the effort, but it almost never is reciprocated even though I know they want me around, with my mom in the past successfully guilting me into staying more.

That brings me to my current situation, I returned home last week after being gone for a while with a plan to be home for 2 weeks. A few days in, my mom tells me that my dad has a health situation which while not life-threatening, could eventually become more serious depending on the outcomes of some treatment which he will be doing for the next few months, and began a couple weeks ago. He is doing fine, is living his normal life, but because of this I spoke with him about it and he was honest, saying that it is a serious situation, but not life or death and one that him and his doctors and trying to prevent from becoming a more serious thing, and that he is very optimistic about it. 

Of course, I knew nothing about this beforehand, and they haven't told anyone else in the family about this, unsure if they will before Thanksgiving. As a result of this, I had already booked my plans to go back to where I was for the next 3 weeks before returning for Thanksgiving. Some of this travel is refundable, some of it isn't, but of course I've been considering cancelling it in light of the news.

My dad pre-empted this question by telling me I should continue to travel and live my life and that nothing would change in the time between now and when I come back, after which I have no plans and can stay as long as I want or am needed. This made me feel more comfortable, and I'm also thinking that if it was truly that serious, they would've let me and my brothers know about it. 

However, part of me is worrying that my dad is downplaying the situation and generally that morally it would be shitty for me to leave and not be there during this time, even if I couldn't do anything and everything is fine with him as of now. Therefore, even though I had been really excited to go back where I was and part of it is not refundable, I'm considering cancelling my plans.

,AmItheAsshole,"Around 2016-2017, there used to be certain games on social media platforms like Facebook, wherein you could anonymously ask questions to someone.

So, there was this childhood friend of mine (my father's friend's daughter) who got married before turning 22. In urban India the age for marriage for women is around 25-27, so I was quite surprised that she got married so early. For the first few days I thought she was forced into an arranged marriage and also asked her directly why she decided to marry so early. She provided some vague response.

Anyway she got married and I attended her wedding functions. I started seeing her Facebook posts where she would post lovely after-marriage pictures and I for the first time understood that she was actually very happy. I realized that marriage can not have a fixed age and you should go ahead with it whenever you are ready.

One day, she created a link for the game and I very excitedly wrote how happy I was seeing her husband and herself together. I also expressed how I was judgemental earlier and had thought that getting married before turning 25 was a big mistake. Now I have realized differently. 

What I didn't understand was, when you write something your tone is not fathomable. There were some typos as well in the post and my ""happy for you"" got all misconstrued. She as well as her Facebook friends really hated my post and started posting hate comments on it. They even pulled my father's name and I got very upset. I tried explaining myself publicly but she got more offended and unfriended me. People thought I was a judgemental and jealous person. I am a people pleaser and till then never really lost a childhood friend like this. I cried for nights at a stretch but never got the opportunity to say sorry or actually explain myself.

It was all a game of misunderstanding. This will always be one of the biggest regrets of my life. Also I learnt that day that you should read and re-read your messages before hitting send.

,AmItheAsshole,"Warning: Racism.

I made a detailed post on my page, this is a sum up.

I (23F) have been with my fiancé, C(24M) for 8 years and had been childhood best friends. I'm Caucasian and he's African American. We had rough upbringings. His upbringing led him to practically raise his younger brother, E (20M) with me helping along the way.

E wanted to introduce us to his new gf. She's Caucasian, seemed sweet and asked that we get to know each other better. It's been mostly texts, hung out 4-5 times alone and the rest with C and E.

A couple of months ago, she wanted to do the 'Ain't gonna answer' TikTok trend. I lip synced the 1st part but she was saying her lyrics out loud '...and I'll probably answer n-word'. She didn't say the slur but said n-word. I gave her a look because there's no need for that, just shut your mouth like the rest of us. I asked her not to post it on TikTok.

They came to our place two weeks later to pick up the weekly prep meals I make E and she was mumbling the song, still using the n-word thing. I let it go because E heard her. If he's not bothered, who am I to get bothered?

We were helping them move into their new apartment last weekend. I noticed she was trying to joke with C. I went down to the car to get my water bottle and came back to find her laughing, C's jaw was clenched and he was aggressively packing his tool box. E's face was hovering between a smile but not.

I asked what's going on and she turns to me, and says 'I asked C about the trip you guys took to Miami, can you believe this n-word...' (Not the slur, n-word)I immediately cut her off with a stfu, she froze and I asked if she's really going to stand there, looking dumb like she didn't disrespect both men. She realized why I'm mad and tried to play it off, that she didn't actually use the slur. I replied that's a weak excuse because her intent was there. She didn't say it but she might as well have. She tried to defend herself but I asked her if I could start referring to her by the r-word? I told her that I wouldn't be using the slur so it should be fine. She flushed red but C had gathered our stuff and started tugging me to the door. We made it to the car before E caught up to us and told me I had no right to ridicule his gf like that. C just gave him a dark look and told him that I spoke for the both of us. 

His gf blocked me on socials and he hasn't texted, didn't pick up his meal prep for this week. I did text him and said that I understand if he needed time away from me, I can leave the house for a few hours so he can see C, talk and pick up the food but he left me on read.

C is on my side. The only reason he didn't say anything to her was because he's intimidating. He's tall and muscled and that was never in his favor in the past. I, however, have no problem going off in all my 5'0 glory on his behalf and have been compared to a Chihuahua by our friends when I do.

,AmItheAsshole,"Before you all jump down my throat, give me a chance to explain. I was with my ex “Venus” for over 10 years, from when I was 15 until I was almost 26. I am currently 31. Venus was raised a vegan and has never (to my knowledge) eaten meat or any animal product. While we were together, we had 3 boys, M11 “Mercury,” M9 “Jupiter,” and M7 “Mars.”

When I first got into the relationship with Venus, I started to follow the vegan diet because she wanted me to, and I’ve mostly followed it even after we broke up, mainly out of habit. During this time, I had to be very careful with what I ate to ensure I got the proper nutrients, and my food bill every month was sky-high. I also had a lot of issues with depression and anxiety. About 3 months ago, I slowly started to reintroduce meat into my diet, and since then, I’ve felt so much better. I haven’t had to buy loads of vitamins or carefully plan my diet to ensure I got every amino acid or avoided deficiencies, and my food bill dropped.

I also started doing research into kids who are raised vegan and found some things that made me nervous. I read that vegan kids can sometimes be shorter and might need supplements for things like B12, calcium, and iron if they aren’t getting everything they need from their diet. None of my boys have started puberty yet, which might be okay, but since I hit puberty at around 9, it got me worried about Mercury. They’re also all in about the 5th-15th percentile for height and weight, which made me want to check in with the doctor, which also made me very concerned after I learnt that their vegan diet could have impacted this. I was never a short kid, but idk I think I just assumed they were just short for their age.

When I brought my concerns to our GP, he recommended introducing meat and animal products into their diets first to see if it would help with growth before considering other options.

So, following that advice, 6 weeks ago I decided to slowly introduce animal products into their diets whenever they had their time with me, but it has been slow. I don't want to introduce it too fast and I gave them the choice with all the information I had and with what the doctor said. I informed Venus about this and she was furious with me, saying how I’m just doing it to be vindictive to her, when I’m not. And that if I don’t stop she is going to go back to family court and get the Child Arrangements Order changed so she has full custody of the boys and I only get visitation. 

I told her that this was recommended by their GP and she said I had ‘no right in going to the GP without her’, when that is not true, it was during my time with them I am entitled to do whatever I want. 

She’s calling me cruel and she’s been telling our boys that they should refuse to eat any animal products and to say I’m forcing them. When this isn’t true and every time they’ve been over they’ve loved trying new foods like real milk, eggs, etc. some they don’t like which is fair. 

AITA?

I was with my ex “Venus” for over 10 years, from when I was 15 until I was almost 26. I am currently 31. Venus was raised a vegan and has never (to my knowledge) eaten meat or any animal product. While we were together, we had 3 boys, M11 “Mercury,” M9 “Jupiter,” and M7 “Mars.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first got into the relationship with Venus, I started to follow the vegan diet because she wanted me to, and I’ve mostly followed it even after we broke up, mainly out of habit. During this time, I had to be very careful with what I ate to ensure I got the proper nutrients, and my food bill every month was sky-high. I also had a lot of issues with depression and anxiety. About 3 months ago, I slowly started to reintroduce meat into my diet, and since then, I’ve felt so much better. I haven’t had to buy loads of vitamins or carefully plan my diet to ensure I got every amino acid or avoided deficiencies, and my food bill dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"I (33M) just started dating my girlfriend (34F) about a week ago. We've known eachother about a month. I have been friends with Casey (29F) for about 2.5 years. We were just friends for a few months then we hooked up for about 3 months while she was getting over her ex. We stopped sleeping together when she started dating Evan. After her and Evan broke up, we did not sleep together and have been completely platonic. She started dating another guy, Aaron about a year ago and they are happy together. Evan placed a boundary that me and Casey couldn't be in the same room together alone (but could do stuff in public or with other people if at an apt) which we both stuck to. Aaron has placed no such restrictions. 

I often host events for Casey because she has a much larger social network but can't host in her apt (we live in NYC so apts are small). I enjoy hosting with her since she does most of the planning and in turn she invites me to many social events which I also enjoy. 

Recently Casey and I co-hosted a brunch on Saturday which is where Casey met my girlfriend, Jane. Casey actually encouraged me to continue dating Jane when initially in our 2nd date, I wasn't really sure about her. I also told Jane at the time we became exclusive that Casey and I had used to sleep together and she wasn't particularly comfortable with the situation. 

For reference, both me and Jane live alone. And Casey lives with her boyfriend about an hour away by subway. I told Jane that we could have some alone time in the afternoon but did not relay that to Casey because I assumed that she had plans. The night before the brunch Casey said she was planning on napping between the brunch and us going out to Halloween parties (which she invited both me and Jane to, the parties were close to us). I would think about it. Later over text Casey said if the brunch was still going on til 6, could her and her boyfriend stay in between and I agreed. 

The brunch went well but at 5pm Jane said she was tired and asked me to kick people out. About 7 were left from the 13 total that came. 

Casey points out that we could have had alone time on Friday, the morning before the brunch or we could have skipped the Halloween parties.

I am sorry for the yap but I simply cannot win when it comes to my birthday so I chose to spend this one alone at a spa that my boyfriend promised me. My boyfriend is threatening to take the spa away because I didn’t want to spend my birthday at a funeral. 1. I’m really weird when it comes to death and open casket funerals 2. if I could barely hang on at my mother’s funeral I don’t think I’d be chipper to be at this one. My plan for my boyfriend was this, I pay for my own spa day and nobody would care if I wasn’t at the funeral anyways perfect plan given I like to be alone anyways. Turns out people did care and I got a ton of messages from his family members questioning me on why I didn’t go and now my boyfriend is distanced. Please help me understand if I was wrong here and maybe what I could do to fix this . Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"Throw away, not that I think the other party is on Reddit. 

My son is turning 8 this his weekend, and I booked a party at one of those indoor trampoline parks where the party package is based on the number of kids. I booked for 20 kids which would allow 15 friends, his cousins, and his brother. 

We sent out the invitations a week or so ago, and I’ve heard back that some of his friends. There’s 10 kids coming (including the family members) and five I haven’t heard from either way. 

I was chatting with my mom last night and mentioned that I might drop the party booking from 20 to 12 to save money (roughly $200). My mom thinks that would an AH move because the other kids could show up and what then. I told her if they show up without RSVPing by the date on the invitation then that’s on their grownups. 

My mom is the nicest lady in the world, but she also taught me manners. RSVPing to a party is good manners. She said it’s not the kids’ fault if the grownups don’t RSVP, and I do see her point. I also don’t want to pay for the kids if they don’t show up.

,AmItheAsshole,"My (28F) family is having Thanksgiving in my city, since both I and a distant relative (let's call her Lucy, 80F) and her kids live here (our extended family is very small, so even distant relatives are close). We're doing it at a restaurant.

My boyfriend of two years (28M) lives about an hour from me and across the country from his parents. He's going to be too busy with work to go all the way to his parents' house and back, so I asked if he could have dinner with us. (If it's relevant, my parents have met him a number of times, so he's not a stranger). I asked my parents first (making clear that I totally understood if they only wanted family at this dinner so they wouldn't feel bad about saying no), and they said they were fine with it if Lucy was. I then asked Lucy, and she said she was happy to include him. She made a strange comment about my father probably only wanting family present, but I assured her that I'd already asked him and he was fine with it. I told my boyfriend that he could come.

A few days later, Lucy texted me saying that my father (63M) told her that he didn't want any non-family present (no other partners are coming) and that he'd never heard anything about my boyfriend coming. This was, of course, a lie on his part. I texted back that I respect the decision, and it was probably just a misunderstanding. In fact, though, there's no way it was a misunderstanding. I think my father changed his mind (or maybe he thought Lucy was going to say no anyway and panicked when she said yes), but instead of just talking to me about it, he went behind my back. This is the sort of thing he does.

Obviously, my boyfriend is the real victim in this, because I had to uninvite him, and that of course hurt his feelings. I told him that if he wanted to, he could of course still come stay at my place over the holiday (my parents are staying in a hotel, not with me) so he wouldn't have to be alone, although I would understand if he didn't want to be anywhere near. He said he'd still come. We agreed that deep down we both kind of want my parents to find out that he's here so my father will feel bad for uninviting him from dinner, but we're definitely not going to make a big deal about it. I talked to an older friend about this whole situation, and she said he shouldn't come, and that I shouldn't try to guilt my parents.

WIll we be the assholes if he does come? I know ultimately it's up to him--he was the one who was hurt--but I'm just trying to get some clarity here.

Edit: Thanks for the replies. Some context: My sister and I are both low-contact with our parents, but we decided years ago that it was easier to just act cordial towards them the couple times a year that we see them than to waste energy confronting them about anything. My father will never change, and my mother is too disconnected from reality to ever see his bad behavior for what it is. In this case in particular I especially don't want to make a splash because I don't want to make things awkward and harm my relationship with Lucy.

My boyfriend knows what kind of people my parents are, and he knows my MO (keep them at arms length, but act pleasant when I do see them), so he wasn't all that surprised about what happened, and he was not upset about my decision to go to the dinner. 

""But you're choosing them over him."" Maybe in some sense...but it sounds a little odd to say that when he and I both know I do not care about my parents at all and am only doing this because it's my policy not to rock the boat. 

""But what if they started making demands about your wedding? Would you just accede so as not to rock the boat then?"" I generally don't see the use in taking stands ""on principle,"" but when it comes to things that actually matter to me and people I care about, I very much do not let my parents walk all over me. 

""Why don't you consider this Thanksgiving dinner something that matters to you and people you care about?"" I don't know--maybe I'm wrong, but it just doesn't seem like a big enough deal. ""But it's not about how you see it; it's about how your boyfriend sees it."" Yeah, but he doesn't seem too sad about it either, and he never suggested that he wanted me not to go.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (24F) live in India. As many of you may or may not know the festival of diwali has started. Starting tommorow we have 4 different days of festivities lined up back to back. 

One of the most common ways to celebrate Diwali is by lightening firecrackers. I personally havent participated in this tradition and personally dont like it much. I cant breath properly (have to breath through mouth cause nose gets blocked sorta) in the smoke created by firecrackers and i hate loud noises plus its not exactly the environmentally friendly thing to do seeing the pollution. 

Now we come to the title. Some people from my building have been cracking the crackers since 8PM this evening and its well past 11 as i am writing this. Now i stay on the 1st floor (as our building is structured the 1st floor is actually the third floor above ground) and they are lighting these crackers right near my apartment. They are so loud that i am literally jumping out of my skin everytime one goes off.

Now for day 1 of diwali we have to get up, bathed and ready in festive clothes before 6:30 AM. And Day 1 is tommorow.

So i am starting to get annoyed by all the noise now and have a strong urge to go and yell at the neighbors to go the f home and sleep since some of us have to get up early in the morning.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (44f) and my husband (50m) have twins (4f). My husband has one sibling and comes from a family that see each other often and don't exchange gifts. I have a brother and his wife who have four children (15,11,9 and 7). I am very aware of everything I purchase and hate waste/clutter but we also have a comfortable lifestyle. My brothers family have a comfortable lifestyle too. The issue I have is we have been clashing over gifts and I don't know if AITA.

The current situation is my brothers family buy myself, my husband and our twins birthday gifts to the amount of £200 total. And Christmas gifts it's the same again. I have let my SIL lead over the years and just matched what she spends roughly. Up until 4 years ago the dynamics were different as I didn't have children so they bought myself and my husband gifts while I bought each family member a gift in return.

The beginning of this year I spoke to my SIL as she is the gift buyer/organiser of their family. My proposal was that now we all have children why don't we just spend the budget on the children and omit the adults. I thought it would take out all the stress of trying to think of gifts for adults and buy things that neither any of us need. I admit I am not the best at thinking of gifts for people and usually end up buying a voucher of some kind to compensate. I also suggested when it was an adult birthday that it would be nicer to just meet up or go for food etc instead if a present. My SIL LOVES buying gifts for people and spending a lot of time and effort doing so. However the gifts for myself and my husband are usually things we never use or need.

Her response was that while she understood my perspective, she does indeed enjoy buying gifts for people so she would carry on doing so for the adults. She did say that I didn't have to do it and can do what I wanted. She said that she knows the gifts aren't always needed and she would have no problem if I regifted it or gave it to charity.

This year instead of splitting the budget equally between the 6 of them I spent 80% of it on the kids and still gave the adults a little something to honour their birthday. 3 of their birthdays all land this week. I get stressed every time trying to work out what to buy and I'll have to do it all again in a months time for Christmas. We have hardly seen each others families over the year due to school/work etc (maybe 3 times) and it just puts it into perspective for me as I'm dropping off gifts and putting it through their letterbox with zero interaction as they're too busy to see me/us. And I just feel it is such a pointless, cold process. Is this the normal process that everyone goes through and just a part of life that I need to accept? Just to add I do not grudge getting my nieces and nephews gifts but £400 a year seems excessive to me too.

So when Christmas is over, I intend to do as I said and not buy the adults any gifts next year.

,AmItheAsshole,"My bf (M, 21) and I (F, 21) went to a small apartment party thrown by my friend Anna and her roommates. Anna's roommate's close friend Sarah was there with her bf Steve. I've met them twice before, and they seemed great. They've been together for 5 years.

Steve was very touchy. Not in a creepy way, but definitely more than a guy with a gf should be IMO, especially bc I'm not close with them. But nobody said anything plus his gf was there, so I figured that's just his vibe and left it alone.

As the night went on, I noticed Steve was EXTREMELY touchy with Anna. He was hanging off of her and holding her hand when she was passed out asleep. (I watched and made sure nothing escalated, not saying it would've, but it's girl code).

He was more touchy with her than anyone else by far, including his gf. She isn't even one of their close friends. For context, Anna is curvy and beautiful, so she gets a lot of male attention, wanted or not.

But again, she seemed okay with it and so did everyone else.

Later, Steve kissed my bf. It was silly. I wasn't bothered by it and neither was my bf. But then I look over and Sarah is right there. She looks extremely sad and uncomfortable. She tried to play it off, but I noticed. Later, Sarah and I are talking and look over and see Steve hugging Anna from behind (Anna was VERY drunk). She once again plays it off, but her face is obvious.

The next morning, my bf relays a talk he had with Steve prior to the kiss. (Context: Steve and my bf are both often mistaken as bisexual.  Steve denies it, and my bf's just super comfortable in his masculinity.) Steve asked if he could admit if another man was attractive. Bf says sure, objectively. And Steve said he finds men attractive, but just isn't sure about ""butt stuff"". My bf walked away with the impression that Steve is interested in men, but isn't comfortable saying it.

At the end of the night, Sarah was trying to get Steve in the car. He was blatantly ignoring her, making a big scene of being drunk until Anna's female roommate was yelling at him to stop. Once my bf stood up and firmly told him to go (the only other straight man) he did. During the whole exchange Sarah looked so defeated and sad.

None of this is damning, but it was all just weird? It felt like he was using being drunk as an excuse to explore his sexuality and disrespect his partner with plausible deniability, even though it clearly makes her uncomfortable.

I called Anna today and told her. She said that he's always made her extremely uncomfortable. He's gotten drunk and tickled her, fireman carried her while she said stop, etc. and she always thought it was weird but since no one seemed fazed, she didn't want to overreact.

She told her roommate, and she's going to present all of this (my bf and Anna's sides) to Sarah so she can decide what to do.

But now I'm thinking. Am I overreacting? I don't want to ruin a friend group I'm not really in or someone else's relationship over  nothing. He doesn't seem like a bad person.

&lt;p&gt;She told her roommate, and she&amp;#39;s going to present all of this (my bf and Anna&amp;#39;s sides) to Sarah so she can decide what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now I&amp;#39;m thinking. Am I overreacting? I don&amp;#39;t want to ruin a friend group I&amp;#39;m not really in or someone else&amp;#39;s relationship over  nothing. He doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a bad person. AITA?&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"This is about my daughter “Amy” (18f). Amy got pregnant at 17 with her boyfriend “Matt” (19m). He was 18 at the time. She found out after he went away to college. He wanted to drop out, but she convinced him to stay in. He was there for the birth of his daughter “Rose”. 


Amy and Rose lived with us for two months before Matt and Amy decided to get married. She had already finished high school via virtual school. I begged her not to get married because they’re young and just now learning about being adults. I said she could go live with him, but to give marriage time. They decided against it. I offered them getting counseling beforehand. Amy said she’d think about it. 


They’ve been gone for a couple months. The communication was dwindling, but I figured she was busy as a mother/wife and had a part time job. They moved into a 3 bdrm apartment with one of Matt’s friends becoming a roommate to help out with bills. The communication continued to decrease so I sent a text apologizing if I did something wrong, but I’d love to hear from her. 


She called me last night explaining she wasn’t mad at me, but she felt confused. She feels alone and like she’s drowning. She said I coddled her too much after she had Rose. That I should’ve held her accountable and made her do more of the daily chores like washing bottles and pumps, washing their laundry, changing Rose’s diaper, feeding her, burping her, cleaning and cooking, letting Amy take naps and showers, etc.  She said she feels disappointed with Matt’s help, and would have been fine with it had I held her more accountable. 
 

I feel she has a point. Maybe I should’ve pointed out things that needed done rather than doing them. So AITA? Reposting this because they said I didn’t clarify why I thought I was the AH. 


Edit: I just wanted to post about Matt to add clarity. He’s helping. But when she was here, it was me and her dad helping. Matt’s still a new dad, and he’s not very confident in his parenting skills. If she cries, he feels like he must’ve done something wrong. Maybe he jostled her when he got up, maybe he didn’t support her head enough, maybe he was holding her too firmly, etc. But Amy said he’s trying. 

That’s why Amy said she wished I had made her do more. She wasn’t prepared for the workload that she’d have to pick up when we weren’t there. She said we just knew what to do and they don’t.

&lt;p&gt;I asked if they could take me home and I called my mom and was like can you just tell them to take me home I am tired and u told me if i left early i could just go home to my own bed. Eventually my mom said to just drop me off at my house because she didn’t want them to have to deal with me. My grandma said she will check and make sure I am there. She also said she doesn’t want me staying home alone when I am a junior in highschool. My mom said i will not get my phone outside of school and that i can’t hang out with my boyfriend for a minimum of two weeks. She says I embarrassed her. Aita? Do i deserve to be grounded? &lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"alright, so let me just give you a little bit of a backstory so you can understand why I might be the a-hole here.

most of my mother's side of the family lives in another country and we haven't visited them in 9 years (they haven't come to see us either, though). we finally went back a month or so ago and honestly, I had a great time. my grandmother's house is the first I've ever thought of as a home and I felt so happy being back.

now, there was this poetry competition where we had to write two love poems. I wrote the first one about romantic love and while I was debating what to write the second one on, my mother said that love is more than just the romantic kind, like platonic or familial or whatever (obviously), and that's what I did. I wrote the second poem on our trip to my grandmother's and how it made me feel, and I included in it the fact that we haven't seen each other for a long time. 

however, I wrote in 3rd person, like it was some imaginary family, and I don't think I've said anything inherently bad about us, just that we haven't spoken properly for a while and that we sort of re-introduced ourselves.

but here's where the problem lies. I got into the finals and the organization is printing one poem of their choosing from each finalist into a book, and they chose my second poem. when I read the poem to my mother for the first time though, she started crying and then explained that she understood it like I felt bad about our visit and eventually told me she didn't like the fact that her life was being exposed like that. 

I argued that literally nobody will know it's about a real-life situation, that it's my life too and I wrote it from my point of view without any direct mention of her, and, after all, she was the one who told me I could write about familial love and is complaining now that I actually did? 

I'm more hurt and confused than anything, and definitely not happy about it being published now. I understand how I probably should've read the poem to her before I sent it to make sure she's fine with it, but then it would only be fair of me to read it to all of my relatives it concerns, and I don't really like sharing my work with the people I know.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (30F) and my boyfriend (35M) have been together for 1 year, known each other for 10.
I want to start this off by saying that we both grew up in similar situations- food wasn't always on the table, clothes were hand-me-downs or thrift store, toys were a luxury, etc.

My boyfriend has a good job, but it doesn't pay well. He's also really good at his job, and I'm super proud of him.

Before we started dating, I had a horrible 9-5 job that I was absolutely miserable at. My co-workers were assholes, and my boss was extremely sexist. On my down time, I began to write my first book. I've always loved writing and dreamed about being a real author someday.

Apparently, it was meant to be because after I finished my first book, it BLEW. UP. I was getting demands for a sequel (which I did write and published), and now I'm getting demands for the third and the mini series. (I won't list the book titles here, I'd like my personal stuff and work stuff to remain separate).

One day, my boyfriend looked at me and said, ""You make in a month what I make in a year."" He didn't say it maliciously, but it had me wondering if maybe he resented me a bit. I asked him, but he said he didn't. He said he was proud of me.
He even started helping me promote my books, and when I wrote my first non-fiction book, he said he was even more proud.

But lately, whenever the topic of money comes up, he gets really quiet and really moody. I've always told him it's not MY money, it's OUR money. I wouldn't be where I am today without his encouragement. I'd probably still be in that awful 9-5 job.

This started when he asked me for help with his car. He was behind a couple of payments, and obviously, I paid it. I don't drive, but he does take me wherever I need to go, so I chip in for gas, and of course, I'll make a payment if he can't. But now his brakes are going too. I told him to make an appointment and he said he can't afford it. I said, ""Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it."" He got super moody, and it bugged me a little.

It's been weeks, and he still hasn't made the appointment. I'm uncomfortable getting in the car now because I don't want the brakes to fail while I'm in there. I don't want the brakes to fail while HE'S in there! When I brought it up again, he said he'll make the appointment when he can afford it. I snapped and told him to just f*cking do it, the car needs to be safe.

I feel like he's actually starting to resent me because I make more money. He won't admit it, but he won't tell me what's actually wrong, either. Now, I feel I made things worse because I snapped at him. AITA? 

Edit to add:
I started writing my first book before we were dating. I would send him chapters and get his advice, so he was sort of my BETA reader and my ARC reader. I finally published the first book still before we were dating and started writing the second a couple of months later. And before this gets thrown out there, him and I never talked about finances when we were just friends. 
He had no idea how much I was making. Unlike my family, who I've more or less cut off because they would use me for money and then treat me like shit the rest of the time, or be really horrible if I said no. In the year we've been dating, I've only wrote my non-fiction book which is relatively short, and am in the process of writing the third installment to my series and starting on the mini series for 2026.

,AmItheAsshole,"I have two children (11f and 8m) with my ex and we share physical and legal custody of them. I pay child support because I'm a higher earner than my ex and the child support is minimal ($150 monthly) but is supposed to help balance things between both homes.

My ex is married again and her family has grown. In the house with her are her husband, his three children (under 10) and their two shared children (under 5).

My ex and her husband struggle financially and have attempted to increase child support five times in the last four years. The courts turned down their request for more child support each time. Twice in front of a judge and the other times we did not make it before a judge before it was denied. My ex was reminded that child support is meant to provide for our kids, not for her family as a whole. My ex argued that the financial burden impacts them but this was not deemed worthy of a child support increase. They were looking for an increase to make it $800 a month. 

My ex has independently asked me to give her $50 here and there. Or to buy stuff for the other children in her home. This happens even when our children are in my home. I always say no. I have told my ex that I am not responsible for supporting her other children and will never provide for them financially. 

Recently this became a more intense issue on their side because our daughter's birthday and her youngest stepchild's birthday are a week apart and our daughter had a great time and got gifts at both my house and her mom's and she had a big birthday party that I hosted. While my ex's stepchild didn't get much and had no party (they could not afford one). I had been asked twice to send some gifts for the other child. My ex also wanted the other kids invited, my daughter didn't so they weren't invited. It pissed my ex off. But then her stepkids lunch accounts went into the negative days after the birthdays were both over and since I topped up our kids, she wanted me to do it for her stepkids and I said no again.

She called me a monster and asked how I could live with myself knowing my children's other family are struggling and are literally drowning in financial difficulty and I could help out but choose not to.

,AmItheAsshole,"I'll try to make this concise. My MIL is nice, but absurdly needy and passive aggressive. We live about 7 hours from her, only see her a few times year. 



I have diagnosed anxiety. I am anxious and uncomfortable staying the night at *anyone*'s house (including my best girl friends, my own close family, etc.), and I also have a low social battery, meaning I can tolerate only so much social interaction before I become worn out, stressed, overwhelmed, etc. These facts, combined with the general stress of the holidays *and* the stress from having to interact with my MIL (and *her* own undiagnosed/untreated anxieties) has left my fiancé and I to compromising to figure out the best way to handle visiting his family during the holidays, as we usually stay at my MIL's home which has been highly stressful for us in the past.

  
In couple's therapy, we came to the conclusion that it may be best to stay at a hotel nearby my MIL, that way I can have my own separate space to retreat to when needed/at the end of the day to unwind and manage my anxiousness, but we will still be able to visit as we normally do. The only difference is we are not staying with my MIL at her house.

  
MIL is very upset about this. She lives in a really old house that isn't the nicest, but she's worked to make it as nice as possible for visitors. She is also used to having my fiancé stay with her whenever he is in town. MIL has two sons, but my fiancé is the only one who is unmarried and without kids at this point, so a lot of obligations from her fall on him. We've tried explaining to her that this is what I need personally to help with my mental wellbeing, but she's just can't get over the fact that we won't stay with her. She is offended, upset and hurt.



I don't want to hurt her feelings, and am tempted to just say fuck it, let's stay with her to alleviate her being upset and not have to deal with her fit (which is in turn making my fiancé upset, and having his brother text him bugging him about ""mom being hurt/upset"" - the guilt is being laid on **thick**), but I feel like this goes exactly against what we've been learning in therapy related to boundary setting with our families of origin. MIL definitely has enmeshment issues with her kids, but fiancé and I haven't been as effected since we live far away.

  
My fiancé 100% backs my feelings and prioritizes my needs - he supports me fully in staying at a hotel. The way his family is responding is making me feel like an asshole, though. We are engaged, and I am still working to build relationships with his side of the family, and it hurts to think that this may warp their views of me. No one wants to come across as overly sensitive and difficult, but that's how their reactions are making me feel.

I am anxious and uncomfortable staying the night at &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s house (including my best girl friends, my own close family, etc.), and I also have a low social battery, meaning I can tolerate only so much social interaction before I become worn out, stressed, overwhelmed, etc. These facts, combined with the general stress of the holidays &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the stress from having to interact with my MIL (and &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; own undiagnosed/untreated anxieties) has left my fiancé and I to compromising to figure out the best way to handle visiting his family during the holidays, as we usually stay at my MIL&amp;#39;s home which has been highly stressful for us in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In couple&amp;#39;s therapy, we came to the conclusion that it may be best to stay at a hotel nearby my MIL, that way I can have my own separate space to retreat to when needed/at the end of the day to unwind and manage my anxiousness, but we will still be able to visit as we normally do. The only difference is we are not staying with my MIL at her house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIL is very upset about this. She lives in a really old house that isn&amp;#39;t the nicest, but she&amp;#39;s worked to make it as nice as possible for visitors. She is also used to having my fiancé stay with her whenever he is in town. MIL has two sons, but my fiancé is the only one who is unmarried and without kids at this point, so a lot of obligations from her fall on him. We&amp;#39;ve tried explaining to her that this is what I need personally to help with my mental wellbeing, but she&amp;#39;s just can&amp;#39;t get over the fact that we won&amp;#39;t stay with her. She is offended, upset and hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt her feelings, and am tempted to just say fuck it, let&amp;#39;s stay with her to alleviate her being upset and not have to deal with her fit (which is in turn making my fiancé upset, and having his brother text him bugging him about &amp;quot;mom being hurt/upset&amp;quot; - the guilt is being laid on &lt;strong&gt;thick&lt;/strong&gt;), but I feel like this goes exactly against what we&amp;#39;ve been learning in therapy related to boundary setting with our families of origin. MIL definitely has enmeshment issues with her kids, but fiancé and I haven&amp;#39;t been as effected since we live far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fiancé 100% backs my feelings and prioritizes my needs - he supports me fully in staying at a hotel. The way his family is responding is making me feel like an asshole, though. We are engaged, and I am still working to build relationships with his side of the family, and it hurts to think that this may warp their views of me. No one wants to come across as overly sensitive and difficult, but that&amp;#39;s how their reactions are making me feel.&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"Just need a reality check here. We are about to go down and talk with my Brother who is 41, living off of my father who is 71 on social security and has a small recurring income from a property rented out. 

Now for the rundown.

How did we get here? My father was having some health issues while living with my brother that spiraled down into disasterous consequences. Unable to walk, soiling himself, and various other issues. Some of this was my father drinking and my brother joining him for smoke times. I could care less for my father he is retired and should be looked after. The problem, he wasn't. My brother uses him like a bank account, doesn't hold a job, doesn't look after him, and even when he was finally taken to the ER my god father took him, not my brother. He didn't help him get to appointments, checck on him, or do various other items. I got a call coming back from a trip since my father missed our weekly breakfast meetings saying he didn't feel well or ill which i asked him if he went to the doctor or had gone. While i thought he was, i later found out he had not been making them and just covering things.

The path to now. ER to Rehad my brother only visited my father to collect money and grab lunch with him overr a span of 4-6 weeks maybe 2 visits. While we were visiting him dailly, getting him needed items, and starting to take over and get all his accounts in order. After he was in rehad and fully conscious he signed over Power of Attorney and numerous items to me as well as jointing me on accts ect... We are taking him to the dentist to get his dentures done, getting him to the doctor getting him fixed up, and moved him up to our property using his money for the building but using our own money to clear and get everything else in order for him. I moved money off his accounts to my name for my father, made him a checking which he has free reign too and agreed to basically spending money in cash as needed with no card, and started cleaning out all the excess charges from his old accounts finalizing a closure soon so ultimate unncessaries are gone. He can't fully walk or get around yet, but we are working on that verifying with the doctor before releasing him back to the roads.

The problem now. Things cost money. With dentures, the ER, Rehab, moving, my brothers various spending on his card, and getting his affairs in order money has been hemmoriging from $110k now to close to sub $20k. Plumbing issues, insect issues, and things where they had not taken care of the house he was at my brother currently lives. We are sitting down soon to basically trim off my brother with a 2 month heads up the card is shutting down,, he needs to get a job, we are taking back my fathers car, and as long as he does have a job, ,he will get a car so long as he can pay insurance and gas ect...

In the beginning my sister was nice, but then we started to play a tabletop game (Dominion). My sister was taking her sweet time every time her turn came and as everyone was experienced every turn took only a short while, so I pointed it out, and she started, to wait for her turn and the write text on her phone delete it and do random things to waste time, we continued playing and finished. She was a bit mad because she placed dead last by a long shot, then I played chess against my cousin and she is not too good at chess so she got assisted by my uncle and my sister, and later a family friend and she won. My cousin continued to say that she didn't win, as she got help so it wasn't her, but then I decided to play against my sister. She started playing and lost a queen (a strong piece), but I played some bad moves losing my queen and another piece giving her a big advantage, she was assisted by all the other people and tried to make move which were bad but was stopped by my uncle who said things like don't do that pushing her hand away and showing her a good move. This helpedher to achieve a good position an she started acting more arrogant and say thing like when you leave you lose afterr I said I gotta leave in one hour. A few times she was given advice and it was clear to play but she spent 10minutes just not doing anything (fine ig). She ended up wining and started mocking me saying look I won haha, I gave my queen but you still lost, grinning. This made me mad as I was leaving so I was playing my moves without thinking. After we finished she remembered that her beloved cat which we heard meowing 40mins earlier should be let in, this made me even more mad as she took a lot of time for the game as she knew I had to go. I ended up leaving 40 minutes later than anticipated with my family saying I'm overreacting, she continued being arrogant while I left and as I shook her hand because I remembered that's how you finish a game she shook only with her pinky laughing.

,AmItheAsshole,"Okay so lets start with this: I am a 21yo female dating a 26yo male
Lets call him CD

So CD and I have been dating for about a year now and its been a rocky year. For context CD has a severe anxiety disorder and doesnt have a lot of friends he hangs around with

We used to work at the same place and long story short I was fired for speaking out on unfair treatment of all employees and also for reporting to one of the manager (lets call her Jelly) that someone in a position of power in the company had done some very bad things to me which I won't mention here. Jelly than proceeded to tell that person to ""be careful because the women were speaking out more about this kind of stuff"" and they could get in trouble. Which in turns led to them threathening me to make my life hell and so long story short I had a breakdown and got fired.

Now, CD knows this whole situation and still works at that place. Recently, Jelly asked him to go to a concert with her. Which normally I wouldnt have minded if it wasnt for the fact it was Jelly. He accepted and told me later on.

So last night we were having a conversation about it and I mentioned that it made me unconfortable that he was going to do an activity with her. At first he replied that he was just hanging with her because they work together but when I brought back what she had done to me, he replied with "" well I dont know, I work with her and she's nice. She's my friend."" 

I then argued that while I understood that he needed to be cordial to her in work settings as she is his boss, he didnt have to be friends with her knowing she hurt me a lot. 

In my mind if someone hurts someone I care about that much, I wont go around hanging out with them 

He then closed the conversation by saying he doesnt get why he should feel guilty for doing what he likes with a friend and that I was overreacting to it saying ""you always have to make things complicated"" and that I should know that he doesnt have a lot of friends so he should take activities as they go.

That made me doubt myself a lot. I'm thinking I mightve come off a bit controlling, rude or complicated by trying to tell him not to hangout with her

Should I apologize?

,AmItheAsshole,"This happened two weeks ago, and I do think that I am an asshole in showing it to him and making his son be really ticked off at me.

My(55 F) friend (35 M) has a 10 year old son, who for the past month on the weekends would go beyond his curfew of 9 pm to get off the computer and get ready for bed by 10 pm. He would get off the computer like around midnight but in the middle of the night, my friend would hear his son's computer turn on around 3 am.

I went over to bring him some boxes as he and his son are moving to a new apartment in a new city in three weeks. While we were sitting down and drinking coffee and shooting the breeze about the joys of moving, thankfully, he had paid vacation time and PTO that he hadn't used up yet. He made mention about his son on the weekends staying up past his 9 pm curfew on getting off the computer to get ready for bed and then hearing him get up in the middle of the night to play on the computer.

I made an offhand suggestion about setting a timer for his computer to turn off. He looked at me like I grew two heads. He asked is that even possible?

I was like yeah, just look on the computer. We had to look up how to put it on, by googling it. He never knew he could set a timer for the computer to turn off. He even googled if it was possible to set the timer to allow the computer to be turned on, I didn't even think that was possible, till we found it on google.

So we got the son's computer set to turn off at 9 pm and wake up at 6 am.

He was very proud of himself for setting it up. I had told him that his son will get used to the boundaries now. Do tell him the consequences of his actions has warranted a new punishment if he doesn't follow curfew by getting off the computer by 9 pm.

Well, I got a phone call that night from my friend, his son was ticked off about his computer turning off at 9 pm. I could hear his son screaming at him for being a bad father and that he's going to be reported for this at school. I told him, the school won't do anything beyond asking what you did, might want to drop him off and go speak with the principal about this, so whatever your son tries to get you into trouble, would be canceled out by you talking to the principal and the teacher probably would be sent a message pertaining to him so he cannot get you into any trouble since this happens at the library and at our school computers too.

My friend asked me if we did the right thing by doing this to him. I told him we did the right thing, he has to learn how to make due with the time he has on the computer before it shuts down, like he has to when he goes to the public library on Saturday, as the computers there shuts down at 4:45 pm.

&lt;p&gt;My(55 F) friend (35 M) has a 10 year old son, who for the past month on the weekends would go beyond his curfew of 9 pm to get off the computer and get ready for bed by 10 pm. He would get off the computer like around midnight but in the middle of the night, my friend would hear his son&amp;#39;s computer turn on around 3 am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went over to bring him some boxes as he and his son are moving to a new apartment in a new city in three weeks. While we were sitting down and drinking coffee and shooting the breeze about the joys of moving, thankfully, he had paid vacation time and PTO that he hadn&amp;#39;t used up yet. He made mention about his son on the weekends staying up past his 9 pm curfew on getting off the computer to get ready for bed and then hearing him get up in the middle of the night to play on the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made an offhand suggestion about setting a timer for his computer to turn off. He looked at me like I grew two heads. He asked is that even possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was like yeah, just look on the computer. We had to look up how to put it on, by googling it. He never knew he could set a timer for the computer to turn off. He even googled if it was possible to set the timer to allow the computer to be turned on, I didn&amp;#39;t even think that was possible, till we found it on google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we got the son&amp;#39;s computer set to turn off at 9 pm and wake up at 6 am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was very proud of himself for setting it up. I had told him that his son will get used to the boundaries now. Do tell him the consequences of his actions has warranted a new punishment if he doesn&amp;#39;t follow curfew by getting off the computer by 9 pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I got a phone call that night from my friend, his son was ticked off about his computer turning off at 9 pm. I could hear his son screaming at him for being a bad father and that he&amp;#39;s going to be reported for this at school. I told him, the school won&amp;#39;t do anything beyond asking what you did, might want to drop him off and go speak with the principal about this, so whatever your son tries to get you into trouble, would be canceled out by you talking to the principal and the teacher probably would be sent a message pertaining to him so he cannot get you into any trouble since this happens at the library and at our school computers too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend asked me if we did the right thing by doing this to him. I told him we did the right thing, he has to learn how to make due with the time he has on the computer before it shuts down, like he has to when he goes to the public library on Saturday, as the computers there shuts down at 4:45 pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His son has been constantly screaming at him for allowing me to destroy his computer time, and it is constant for the last two weeks. I seriously feel like I am the AH in this as I cheated his son out of being responsible with his computer time, but his dad asked me for advice and I gave it and his dad did it.&lt;/p&gt;

Well for the past feel weeks I do what I always do and live my child-free life, especially on my days off. I will be in and out of the house, exploring, making food, whatever I want. I haven't been taking care of the dog since no one has said anything. Both roommates and my entire friend group know how I feel about pets, I don't have them for a reason, I don't like the added responsibility or the costs.

Well today, my roommate's partner before he left for work stated ""hey dog should be good just needs lunch around 1pm, one scoop of the food, and then needs to be walked."", Which took me by surprise considering the dog is not mine, so to not even ask was a little shocking. The dog will also only be in the house fending for himself for 4 hours. I see it as a parent just leaving their child in the hands of whoever is there and asking them to parent.

Today, I am going to do it, but when my roommate gets home I'm going to have a discussion with them letting them know my rules (which I have used since living with anyone), that I don't take any responsibility for the dog and if they need extra care while both parents are away, they need to hire a caretaker.

,AmItheAsshole,"I'm (25m) engaged to Ash (25f) and recently we had an incident with my family where I put my foot down with my family and they think I'm TA. So we were all having dinner, mom and dad, half siblings (mom's kids with her ex-husband) and their spouses, full siblings, and me and Ash. During dinner my parents asked Ash if she'd heard from her siblings recently and Ash said no and she wouldn't expect to ever hear from them. 

Ash was raised with half siblings who were older than her but did not like that she existed and made sure she knew she was less than in their eyes for being half. They chose no contact once they turned 18 and cut off their (shared) dad too. Ash carries some sadness around because of it. She's an only child otherwise and still loves them and sometimes struggled with the little girl inside of her who really looked up to them. But she's working with a therapist to make sure she's doing better mentally. Especially now that she's an adult who has accepted she'll never have a relationship with them.

My siblings brought up that they find the half thing weird and we never used it and nobody they know would ever personally use it. Mom said it's not something that should be encouraged and she'll never understand anyone dividing family up that way.

My half siblings said they just don't want to think people use it, but they do all of the time. They said they always used it for us. That most of us just closed our ears off to it and liked to pretend we're all full siblings. They said we're not and the relationship they have with the rest of us will always be less than the one they have with each other because they have an entirely different side of their family to us and a different dad to us and we only think it's the same because we never went through divorce and/or death of a parent. They went through both. My half siblings went onto say their kids know we're not their real aunts and uncles and that our dad isn't their real grandpa. And it's dumb to think step and half are ignored.

,AmItheAsshole,"Am I the Asshole for choosing my BF (25) against my father's wishes? 

Me (23) and my boyfriend (25) started dating April of 2023. We have known each other since I was 14 and he was the guy to take me on my first date. Our teen age years we disconnected but always checked in with each other over the years. When I was 15yr I moved to SC with my mother from TN and finished high school. When i was 19-20 years old I moved back to TN with my father and his family. 

My father (56) and mother (53) separated by the time I was 2yrs old. I mainly have always lived with my mother, but I was at a point within my life where I was going down the wrong path. August of 2020, I moved states and began living with my father because I knew it would bring the structure I needed during that point in time. During this time, I started online college, got a under paying job, and just stayed to myself most of the time. Now my father was in the military and growing up he could be rough on us kids. When he remarried, he now has 5 more children ranging in ages between (9-3), with this he has become a lot more chilled out than previous years. 

He and my stepmother are financially well off, yearly vacations, nice cars, hosting family get togethers. Since he was previously in the military, I was able to use a grant to help me go to college. With this money we used it to pay for a car that was under my stepmom's name (that I drove) while I paid for school completely out of pocket. They did not charge me rent but in return I would clean house, babysat almost daily while he ran earns and when she was working (at home). I also helped with the two German Shepards they had. (They used to breed them). If I was not at work, I was at home doing schoolwork (normally while watching the baby), cleaning, or taking out dogs. I am so thankful for them and hated to complain about anything because of everything they did for me. 

While living there I began to get lonely, I did not have friends in my hometown anymore and the ones I did have, my parents would not let me go see and would get upset if I spoke to them. Other than being at home I really did not have a social life anymore. When I hit 21, I did start going out to the pub on Fridays and they honestly would let me go most weekends which lasted a few months. 

That is when my boyfriend came back into the picture. During all of this we would stay in touch. In 2021 he actually met my dad, but he had just gone through a bad break up and he did not want that to affect the way my family and I myself would view him. 

When we did actually become a couple, my family liked him a lot. They saw that he cared about me and I for him. He worked out of town so EVERY weekend he would make the 4-hour drive to come see me and the 4-hour drive back to work. I traded going out every weekend to him coming over, me going to his dads to just hang out for 4-5 hours at night. (We were not allowed to stay the night with each over for the first 5-6 months of us dating. I had a curfew by 1 am or he had to leave by 2am. In October of 2023 he went on an Orlando Disney Trip with my whole family and in my option it went amazing. Once we got home my dad and stepmom started saying things about him that honestly I did not agree with. 

My boyfriend isn't the type to hold open doors, and he normally did wait to see me go inside the house, except we lived in a nice neighborhood at you had to turn around and go back by the house to leave the neighborhood. On his way back out I would turn my bedroom light on, so he knew I was completely inside. (He would stop in front of my house if it wasn't) He even left his out-of-town job to be closer to me even if he was taking a huge pay cut. We occasionally went out drinking together and he always drove. He would never drink as much as me since he had to drive me back home. One night we went out and saw his brother that he had not seen in years and their dad ended up coming along. We both ended up getting extremely drunk, His dad followed us to my house, I took the dogs out (Forgot the lock the cage completely) and we both passed out. 

The next morning, I woke up to my dad yelling at us to turn off the alarm that we both slept through and him telling me to get my ass downstairs cause one of the dogs got out into the garage and chewed up a bunch of stuff. He asked me if my boyfriend drove me home drunk and I told the truth about exactly want happened. When dad went upstairs and asked him, he lied saying he didn't drink and drive with me. After this he never came over again and I now had to be back from his house by 11pm. I understood because it was dangerous, and my BF completely understood too. For the next 2 months it was like this, my parents talking bad about him even after he tried multiple time apologizing. He stopped drinking completely for 6 months because of that night. He even warned me that my parents were going to tell me to either leave him or get out the house. I honestly never thought they would have just because of a bad choice and after everything we had been through. 

The night after Christmas of 2023, my stepmom looked at me and said, ""If you are choosing to stay with him you need to hurry up and pack your things to leave."" I had a complete melt down to say the least, I called my BF who also started freaking out. I was going to leave him, but I honestly could not do it. I see myself marrying this man, having his children. After all of this time I finally had someone in my life where I could be myself without being corrected or put down. 

I tried to go talk to my dad about him and he said, "" Out of all the things me and (stepmom) changed about you, the one thing we can't change is your shitty taste in men.""  Not to mention him bringing up that he could not take care of me later on in life because he is an amputee and is missing his left foot to lower leg from an accident, he was in at 2 years old. We continued the conversation, and I honestly said some hurtful things like "" maybe if you were actually in my life as a kid Id know what that is."" (Him and my birth mother cheated on each other heavily when I came into the picture.) He was also always gone on duty; I maybe saw him 1-2 times a year until I was 11. I still feel horrible about my choice of words and still to this day get upset thinking about it. 

I ended up leaving that night and have lived with my boyfriend since. Parents sold the car I drove, and I never saw any of the money from it. (That was being paid for with my school grant.) Had to drop out with only 9 credits to go since I could not afford the 5K a semester. The first four months we lived at his dad's trailer, and I would remember my stepmom saying, "" If you want to be trailer park trash then go ahead and go."" We ended up moving back to SC to work for the company he did previously. 

We now live in a beautiful 3-bedroom house, have a dog together and I just bought a new 2024 Hyundai that had 5k miles on it. Honestly for being 23 and 25 we are doing really well for ourselves. We both make fantastic money together. He pays most of the bills and just lets my worry about my own personal bills and utilities. He wants me to be able to save up to go back to school since he knows how passionate I am about finishing. I tried calling my father on holidays, his birthday, and went to a funeral to a family member he was extremely close to so I could be there to support him (his wife was not there) as I expected. Not once has he called me (other than a butt dial) to check in on me, see if I am doing okay, said Happy Birthday or just see if I am okay after Helen. 

I know this is a super long post, but I wanted to be completely transparent about this situation. I still feel horrible about the whole situation. My father is a great man, he has done so much for our country, and I would not ask for a different father. He has done more than expected for me after I turned 18. He did not have to take me back in and support me while I was going through a hard time but I starting to feel resentful because he has not reached out whatsoever in 10 almost 11 months. I also am so deeply in love with my man. He supports everything I do, never once has cussed me, put my down or spoken bad about my family. He incredibly hard working, even with his disadvantage in life. Not once has he ever let that hold him back. He grew up in extremely difficult circumstances, including being homeless at 17 after his family lost his childhood home. Everything we have today is because he has never given up on himself or us.

&lt;p&gt;Me (23) and my boyfriend (25) started dating April of 2023. We have known each other since I was 14 and he was the guy to take me on my first date. Our teen age years we disconnected but always checked in with each other over the years. When I was 15yr I moved to SC with my mother from TN and finished high school. When i was 19-20 years old I moved back to TN with my father and his family. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father (56) and mother (53) separated by the time I was 2yrs old. I mainly have always lived with my mother, but I was at a point within my life where I was going down the wrong path. August of 2020, I moved states and began living with my father because I knew it would bring the structure I needed during that point in time. During this time, I started online college, got a under paying job, and just stayed to myself most of the time. Now my father was in the military and growing up he could be rough on us kids. When he remarried, he now has 5 more children ranging in ages between (9-3), with this he has become a lot more chilled out than previous years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He and my stepmother are financially well off, yearly vacations, nice cars, hosting family get togethers. Since he was previously in the military, I was able to use a grant to help me go to college. With this money we used it to pay for a car that was under my stepmom&amp;#39;s name (that I drove) while I paid for school completely out of pocket. They did not charge me rent but in return I would clean house, babysat almost daily while he ran earns and when she was working (at home). I also helped with the two German Shepards they had. (They used to breed them). If I was not at work, I was at home doing schoolwork (normally while watching the baby), cleaning, or taking out dogs. I am so thankful for them and hated to complain about anything because of everything they did for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While living there I began to get lonely, I did not have friends in my hometown anymore and the ones I did have, my parents would not let me go see and would get upset if I spoke to them. Other than being at home I really did not have a social life anymore. When I hit 21, I did start going out to the pub on Fridays and they honestly would let me go most weekends which lasted a few months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is when my boyfriend came back into the picture. During all of this we would stay in touch. In 2021 he actually met my dad, but he had just gone through a bad break up and he did not want that to affect the way my family and I myself would view him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we did actually become a couple, my family liked him a lot. They saw that he cared about me and I for him. He worked out of town so EVERY weekend he would make the 4-hour drive to come see me and the 4-hour drive back to work. I traded going out every weekend to him coming over, me going to his dads to just hang out for 4-5 hours at night. (We were not allowed to stay the night with each over for the first 5-6 months of us dating. I had a curfew by 1 am or he had to leave by 2am. In October of 2023 he went on an Orlando Disney Trip with my whole family and in my option it went amazing. Once we got home my dad and stepmom started saying things about him that honestly I did not agree with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend isn&amp;#39;t the type to hold open doors, and he normally did wait to see me go inside the house, except we lived in a nice neighborhood at you had to turn around and go back by the house to leave the neighborhood. On his way back out I would turn my bedroom light on, so he knew I was completely inside. (He would stop in front of my house if it wasn&amp;#39;t) He even left his out-of-town job to be closer to me even if he was taking a huge pay cut.

Now I consider my self a stoner I smoke very regularly. My friend on the other hand hasn’t smoked in many months barely even a drinker. Yes I am aware of this I ask her if she’s sure she says yes she takes about two hits and a few minutes later she’s freaking out. I mention to her that the bar won’t be packed so no one is going to be watching us. ( her biggest concern was people looking at us while sitting at the bar. She views sitting at bars as an older man thing and thought we would be judged for being there ) She hears bar and doesn’t like it immediately she starts complaining. This annoys me because she knew we were coming to this bar all day. And I am someone who has been waitingggg on moments like this so I double down and tell her she can sit at a table but I will sit at the bar. 

I give her 20 mins in the car to sit and calm down but then I tell her I’m not waiting any longer and she needs to get up. We get to the bar and she can’t find her id which she just had in the car. Now she’s suggesting getting a table and I honestly ignore her because at this point I believe it’s on purpose. after I get a drink we leave the bar and hit a different place and everything calms down from there to have a pretty ok night. I did explain to her how I don’t feel comfortable smoking around her anytime soon since this was actually something I was looking forward to and I’m not a nurturing person and I’ve never got anxiety from smoking so I truly don’t know how that feels. She apologized and said she understood I dropped her off and we called it a night aita?

,AmItheAsshole,"My wife and I have a blink camera in our living room. We used to have a nanny for our son and it made sense then. Now our son is at daycare and my wife claims that she needs the camera to “check on the dogs” when she’s not home or sometimes when she’s working in the other room.

,AmItheAsshole,"Me (24M) and my father haven't had any relationship since he left home when I was 11. I learnt to live without him, however, a few months ago I started to miss him, and after thinking about it for days, I called him. We decided to meet. It went great and since then we are seeing each other often. I went to his house and met his gf. I love her, she is a very sweet woman. She heard my worries and supported me. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and somehow she made me feel comfortable enough to open up.

I need to put you in context: I don't have a good relationship with my mom, she doesn't work and I am the one paying bills. My financial situation is bad, but I managed to save up for a trip this December. My gf lives far away and we can only see each other twice a year. I planned many months ago to go visit her this December. The flight and hoteal are already paid for ($302). I explained it to my father and his gf, telling them how excited I was.

Now this is what happened. I have had my cat for 16 years. I love her, I was 8 when we found her in the street. Last Sunday she looked bad. She didn't walk well, kept falling. My father came with me to the vet. They said my cat had some neurological problem and they need to do some tests to find out what exactly it is... which cost AT LEAST $540 (it will keep going up). I can't pay it because I don't have any help at home. My mother isn't willing to pay anything because she doesn't care. She has even stolen money from me to smoke. I told my father I'd see what I can do. Everything seemed fine, till he texted me at night that I had my priorities wrong, he found it offensive I was going to pay for a trip to visit my gf, but not the vet. I explained him the trip is already paid, and even with that extra money, I wouldn't have enough. Don't get me wrong though, I'm going to do something about it, working overtime or pay in installments. I felt hurt with his comment because he knows how excited I am and he talked about it in a very cold way. I said I was hurt. He was talking badly about something that is important to me. I just want to spend time with the person I love the most. But I felt like a selfish person for paying for a flight. The argument got worse.

I'm angry and hurt by your words"". He answered I was being disrespectful and he wouldn't allow me to speak to him that way. We kept arguing for days and I told him that I was thinking about cutting off contact permanently, and he said that was blackmail.

This happened few hours ago. I feel like I've ruined everything. I was happy spending time with him. It truly saddens me to think we won't talk more.

,AmItheAsshole,"Throwaway account.

I (35M) have 2 kids (9M,6M). Context: I just started a new remote job so my medical benefits haven't kicked in yet. My partner has a job that requires them to travel and are currently away.

For the past 2 weeks the three of us have been dealing with a cold/flu bug. Its wasn't serious enough outside of taking your standard otc remedies and continue going to school/work.

Today, the day before Halloween, the kids got a bit worse and wanted to stay home from school. I also felt worse so I made the necessary arrangements (contacting my job/school etc). Kids are in bed watching TV and we'll be doing soup and medicine for our diet today.

Now my oldest has a fair amount of common sense so I did warn him that if they still feel sick enough to miss school tomorrow as well as today, then they can't go trick or treating. He understands this.

I gave my in-laws the heads up about the potential cancelation as they planned to join in our trick or treating tomorrow. They think I'm ruining the holiday for the kids. My partner, while agreeing with me, wants me to bend to their will because they don't want us to deal with the drama afterwards ie ""you'll never hear the end of it"".

While I get the point, I wasn't going to be completely heartless on the subject. I was going to make some Halloween themed snacks and do some kid friendly Halloween movies and allow them to wear their costumes all day tomorrow (just in bed) and buy them some discounted candy after Halloween to make up for the trick or treating loot they'll miss out on.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (27F) got into a serious relationship with my BF (30M) about 3mths ago. I had a best-friend (29M) (Sam) - he and I hung out almost every weekend (at most we met 3x a week). We are also part of a friend group. Sam is gay - he is only into men and I am female. 

Since entering the relationship with BF, I spend most free-times and weekends with my BF.  I introduced BF to Sam (and the friend group) and in total they met about 3-4 times. The interactions they had were minimal as it was all in group settings. The interactions were good and BF got along with my friends.

After they “met”, Sam began telling me and everyone about how he doesn’t like BF, and that he didn’t approve of the relationship. He sent essay-length messages with reasons as to why BF was not suitable for me. I never raised any concerns to warrant these reasons, so I don’t know where Sam got them from. 

As time went on, Sam kept making more passive aggressive and snarky comments about BF and my relationship. One time, Sam got very annoyed when he found out I was hanging out with my BF two-nights in a row. A friend told me that Sam was messaging her that he didn’t like BF and made some insulting comments  about me. Other friends also came forward to tell me that Sam was negatively gossiping about me/BF.

One day,  I messaged the group chat to make plans for a group dinner. Sam asked “Is BF joining?” I responded with “yes - are you going to ask this every time?” to which he responded “I will not be joining if he comes. And yes I’ll ask everytime, because I don’t like him.”

At this point I had enough and got very upset at his constant disrespect to me in public (group chat) and we ended up having a big argument over private DM, and I basically said to Sam:

1. BF is going to remain in my life, so he will join me to a lot of group plans. Sam did not have to like him but I would no longer tolerate any rude and disrespectful comments made to me or BF. 
2. Sam needs to stop being disrespectful to me and BF by actively excluding him.   

Sam basically said back to me:

1. I was being disrespectful to him for bringing BF into my life(??) and bringing him to plans without asking him whether it was ok first. 
2. He only wants to hang out with me or friends in our group and does not want ‘outsiders’ to join. 

I called bullshit on his last point - our friend group had grown as a result of meeting new people and Sam had no issue with another friend’s partner joining in on group plans. 

I asked Sam why he hates BF so much, and he says he just doesn’t like him for me and that we seem too different for each other.

Everyone else in the friend group has remained neutral and have made no comments. Everyone (except Sam) likes BF and we have hung out in a group a few times.

After a week of no-contact since the fight, Sam blocked me on social media, and removed himself from group chats (he probably made a separate group chats excluding me).

,AmItheAsshole,"I (19F) moved out of my parents’ house after escalating fights, particularly with my stepdad (45M). Our conflicts often stemmed from misunderstandings, but things came to a head when I was woken up from a nap by him yelling at me. I responded defensively, and we quickly devolved into a shouting match.

Despite my efforts to explain that I’m a deep sleeper, my stepdad accused me of being lazy and ungrateful. He threatened to raise my rent significantly and claimed I’d never find a cheaper place. Out of frustration, I found an apartment online that was cheaper than what I was paying them.

During the argument, my stepdad told me to move out. I insisted that since I’d paid rent for the month, I deserved to stay until the end of it.

,AmItheAsshole,"Keep in mind: Late teens

Was in a relationship for about 1.5years, the first year was fine, everything went well. However I did have an underlying feeling that she was just in the relationship to make more friends with my other friends.

Fast forward to the next year, I couldn't help but notice she started distancing herself away, i.e I asked for PDA such as hugs or even just some hand holding, but they always had excuses such as ""Oh I cant because titles""(despite pretty much everyone already knew). Yet despite this she was okay with skinship with other boys.

This goes on, further to her not even sparing any time for us to go out together, yet when she, her friend group, and some of my friends plans an outing she has millions of time for it.

Feeling unappreciated, I did ask her about it and she said ""Im trying to fix it so match my vibes"" yet she never made an effort and continued as usual blaming ""Oh im very emotional"". (From my perspective it looked like she wasn't even trying at all). 

This is just me being sensitive, but:
We once had matching pfps on our socials but I decided to take it off for a while to see what she would do, but after saying like ""oh you dont wanna match anymore?"" She used a picture of my friend(a boy) like around the day after.

Anyways, this goes on for a few months until I couldn't take it anymore and just broke up.

This is extra bit of info but try not to let it affect your judgement:

After the breakup, I admit I said quite the harsh words to her as I felt very disrespected and unappreciated, but guess what, less than two weeks apart(in my guesstimate) she's now dating my friend (the boy she set her pfp to).

I did feel this somewhat happening(like she was going after my ""friends"" instead) as she would always hang out with my ""friends"" instead of me and when I asked her ""Am I not your friend?""(When we were still together) She just replied with ""No cause titles"".

Im happy for them they get their typical romeo saves juliet after breakup story atleast but I wanted to ask for clearance on my side;

My mum sometimes starts crying and sometimes in a low mood all of a sudden. I normally try and comfort her, and she tells me whats wrong. I don't have an issue with that, but the thing is shes recently been taking out all her negative things out on me, like blaming me for thing I can't control, and making me solve her problems. I'm still in highschool, and I currently have lots of assesments right now so it's hard to maintain family stuff and school stuff at the same time.

Shes normally nice to me when I'm comforting her, but she can get mad really easily and I'm the one she takes it out on (most of he time). I've gotton used to it and I normally just ignore her until she's calmed down, and it works fine for most anger outbursts. What I can't stand about her is the fact I'm expected to be her therapist and be there whenever shes in a bad mood, but I have no one to talk to. I've tried telling her I just wanted to put myself first for a bit, but she called me selfish, and completely unacknowleged everything I've done for her before.

I can't talk any sense to her and I've essentially given up on that. She just refuses to listen to whatever I have to say, and calls me attention seeking. Part of me wants to tell her that I'm not doing too good mentally as well, but the other part of me knows she won't do aything about it.

Due to a few different things, I have started smoking again. (I am aware of the dangers of tobacco smoking, but for now, let’s assume that I don’t plan on quitting.) 
Not wanting to wanting to hide things from him, I told my bf about my smoking. Not surprisingly, he got very upset. 

He talked about the dangers of smoking. And I told him that I already knew about them.

I said “I don’t want to hear about this every day from you.” He kind of made a face like he didn’t like that I said that, but we moved on. 

Well, later, I went outside to smoke and came back. I washed my hands, rinsed my mouth with water, and then started chewing gum. My bf immediately kissed me and then complained that there was a taste of cigarettes. I said “you kissed me literally after I have just come back from smoking and are now acting surprised.

Three days later she asked me the question again and said I had a weird reaction to the question. I ignored her but she asked again, this time in front of my mom. My mom backed up my stepsister and told me she was allowed to ask since I'm so distant with her and refuse to stop calling her my stepsister when she calls me her brother.

I got really frustrated with them and I called them out. I told my stepsister she was asking a question that would lead to a really bad reaction if I answered one way and she'd likely call bullshit with the good answer. I told her she might not like that I call her my stepsister when she calls me her brother but it doesn't mean she can force questions that could have negative consequences on me. I told mom she was just looking for me to say something that could get me into trouble for this because she doesn't like that I still use step. My mom told me I should be willing to accept consequences, like punishment consequences, if I'm going to remain distant from more than half of my family (stepdad and stepsister). I told her she wasn't being fair because I was civil and polite and I didn't cause shit for anyone. She yelled at me that I should have been willing to open my heart to growing our family after dad died and instead I made life sad for all three of them because I'm not along for the ride. She said being polite isn't good enough when people's emotions and hearts are in the mix.

,AmItheAsshole,"AITA? I (43f) live with my partner (41m) and my daughter (15f), close to my parents. Six years ago, after separating from my daughter’s father (we were together 18 years, married for 10), I relied heavily on my parents, especially my mom. She supported me emotionally and financially, helped with childcare, and was there for me through the difficult transition. Moving closer to them strengthened our bond, and she helped by doing some cleaning and feeding my daughter after school while I worked. When I met my current partner, she continued helping with my daughter after school, but I started to regain my independence.

My partner has bipolar disorder, which has brought some challenges, including job instability and a period of heavy drinking that led us to briefly separate. He eventually found the right support for his mental health and drinking, and we reconnected, enjoying a stable relationship for the last two years. My mother, however, disapproved of our reunion and distanced herself for five months, only reconnecting when she faced a cancer diagnosis. Although strained, we were working on our relationship, and I accepted her leaning on my sister for support through her treatment.

Ten months later, she went into remission and began feeling better. She returned to helping around my home, doing light cleaning and ironing, which I expressed was unnecessary but appreciated. Her involvement, though, started to feel possessive. She began reprimanding me over cleaning choices, insisting she handle my daughter's bedding, and becoming critical of small tasks.

Things escalated when my partner, who had recently lost his job, picked up laundry from my daughter’s room. My mother took this as an insult and accused him of spitefulness. A major argument ensued, and despite my attempts to set boundaries and explain there was no ill intent, she insisted on controlling aspects of our household tasks. When I got up to leave, she followed me, physically shoving me out and telling me not to return. I haven’t been back in two weeks.

Now, I’m questioning whether I should have backed down, as she’s unwell and undergoing tests to determine if her symptoms are post-chemo or something more serious. My partner thinks she’s being narcissistic and dramatic and says I shouldn’t apologize, especially as I usually end up doing so regardless of who’s at fault.

(This my first post and english is not my native language)

So, I’m 15 Years old (Male) and my brother is 16.He doesn’t like me and openly brags about it. Everytime we’re together at a family reunion he always belittles me and makes everyone laugh this way. Of course, it hurts, but je doesn’t even care. It wasn’t always this way: up until 2020, we lived eachother very much and always did things together, whereas now he’s always trying not to talk to me. I also have a younger sister (9) and he absolutely loves her; they always play, read, talk and go outside together. But with me it just isn’t the same. He simply hates me. 
The quote-unquote breaking point was last week. I was meant to go to my uncle with my mom and sister but in the end I didn’t want to go because I had too much homework. So when my brother found out about this, he got very angry. We had an argument and said the same things as always: that he doesn’t like and never dit, etc…
I forgot to mention this but I do everything within the house: I cook for my family, I take care of my sister’s homework, I always do the laundry and the dishes, I clean the house with the mop amongst others…. 
So, during the argument, he lied about how I never do the chores around the house, the argument got heated and he punched me (Which isn’t all too uncommon with him). I told my parents ans they all dismissed it, saying it was just quarrels between teens (it most likely is but still not an excuse to hit your brother). So I decided to stop doing the chores, and now all my family is overwhelmed, especially because he was always lazy, and whenever my brother tells me to do something, I don’t.

,AmItheAsshole,"Throwaway and fake names.

I (18F) recently joined a new friend group at my high school after my old friend group fell apart because of growing distance and past friendship dramas. My current group is small and tight knit, with about 7 people in total including me.

My friend group has about 7people in total including me. Amber, Lucy, Celine, me, Claudia and Wendy. Most of the group, including me, shared the same hobbies of swimming, drawing comics and reading books. Recently though, I picked up a new hobby of creative writing, specifically fanfiction. I knew about platforms such a Wattpad, FFN and AO3 and decided to ask a friend outside of my school, who is an avid writer on the platforms.

After the friend had introduced me to some beautiful AO3 fanfictions and how the platform worked in general, I fell down the rabbit hole of fanfiction, due to its creativity and the amazing writing quality of the authors, hence I felt inspired to try and write a fanfiction of my own. I wanted to give it a shot because 1) it's good writing practice and 2) It just seemed fun, though I admit I did want to get a bit of publicity on AO3, before trying to write some original content.

I thought a bit about what fandoms to write about and I tried to think of really big fandoms to gain publicity, such as Harry Potter, BNHA etc. But I wasn't interested in those fandoms and I didn't want to write a fanfiction about a fandom I didn't care about, so another idea came to mind. Since I was a huge KPOP listener, I decided, why not try writing a KPOP fanfiction? I wouldn't have to worry about writing out of character and the fandom was big enough to get a lot of constructive criticism and traction.

When I had told my friends that I was writing a fanfiction though, they asked about the fandom and I said ""Stray Kids"", as they are my favourite group right now. This is where I might be the AH. When they asked about the plot, I told them it was a fantasy/horror AU with a bit of chemistry between the two MCS, Han and Leeknow. I emphasised that there was nothing sexual in the fic and that I didn't actually ship them together.

My friends then accused me of being ""delusional and parasocial"" because I was writing a ""ship fic"" between two irl celebrities, before telling me what I was doing was creepy and in their words, ""Sasaeng behaviour"". I argued back and said that there was no smut and the romance was going to be very light, before emphasising that I didn't actually ship them and was just writing out of fun. I also told them that it was the same kind of thing with fanmade edits and compilations that were intended to be a joke. But my friends are still not accepting my explanation and calling me a creep and now I'm wondering whether what I did was genuinely out of line/creepy behaviour.

So Reddit, AITA here?

,AmItheAsshole,"My(48F) son (26M), ''James'' very recently got married to his wife (24F), ''Lily''. For some backstory, my husband passed away in a tragic car accident when my son was around a year old. It was devastating, and in some ways, I still haven't moved on. It's been just me and James for so long, and I'm really happy he's found someone who loves him. Now, he was living with me during that time, so Lily moved in with us. They discussed it before and were okay with that.

We had a family gathering at our house, where we basically have lunch and play some games, stuff like that. It was suggested by one of my husband's cousins who lives nearby, ""Tom"", and we all liked the idea, but the date he suggested was our anniversary, and we'd complete 30 years of marriage if my husband was around. I wanted the day to myself, and asked him if we could do it some other day, but he said it's the only weekend everyone is free, because they all have work or studies lined up for the others. I tried reiterating that it wasn't a good time, but they decided to have it then anyways. So most of the relatives who live nearby, my daughter with her husband and kids come over. I really didn't want to deal with people at all, but I was trying to keep it together.

While we were having lunch, Tom and his wife announce that their daughter (20) is dropping out of college and starting a business, and they wanted to celebrate her taking this new step in life. Everybody was happy for her and started discussing about her plans. I know I was supposed to be happy for her, but I was having a hard time being happy about anything. After a while, while playing a board game, they say that she needs capital, and they don't have enough. They suggested my son ''loaning'' them the money his father left him. Tom and family are known to never pay people back, so of course my son refused. Tom was upset and said that it was ''his fair share anyways'', which my husband should have given him. My son never got along well with him or his family, so he refused and said it's his, and he's not interested in supporting his daughter's business. After some back and forth, Tom's wife continued about how we should be more supportive of her as it's hard enough to start a business as a woman. My son refused, and Tom said to me ''Good job on raising a misogynist''. I was silent. At some point they dropped it and focused on the game, but they kept throwing stray remarks at my husband for leaving him nothing in his will. They weren't upfront enough to catch attention, but I couldn't take it, and I asked them to stop. They didn't. I had enough, and badly needed an outlet. I ended up crying. Tom, wife and daughter gave me an earful for making everything about myself again, said that I should put living relatives over a dead person, that it's been 25 years, I need to move on, and left.

For some backstory, my husband passed away in a tragic car accident when my son was around a year old. It was devastating, and in some ways, I still haven&amp;#39;t moved on. It&amp;#39;s been just me and James for so long, and I&amp;#39;m really happy he&amp;#39;s found someone who loves him. Now, he was living with me during that time, so Lily moved in with us. They discussed it before and were okay with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a family gathering at our house, where we basically have lunch and play some games, stuff like that. It was suggested by one of my husband&amp;#39;s cousins who lives nearby, &amp;quot;Tom&amp;quot;, and we all liked the idea, but the date he suggested was our anniversary, and we&amp;#39;d complete 30 years of marriage if my husband was around. I wanted the day to myself, and asked him if we could do it some other day, but he said it&amp;#39;s the only weekend everyone is free, because they all have work or studies lined up for the others. I tried reiterating that it wasn&amp;#39;t a good time, but they decided to have it then anyways. So most of the relatives who live nearby, my daughter with her husband and kids come over. I really didn&amp;#39;t want to deal with people at all, but I was trying to keep it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were having lunch, Tom and his wife announce that their daughter (20) is dropping out of college and starting a business, and they wanted to celebrate her taking this new step in life. Everybody was happy for her and started discussing about her plans. I know I was supposed to be happy for her, but I was having a hard time being happy about anything. After a while, while playing a board game, they say that she needs capital, and they don&amp;#39;t have enough. They suggested my son &amp;#39;&amp;#39;loaning&amp;#39;&amp;#39; them the money his father left him. Tom and family are known to never pay people back, so of course my son refused. Tom was upset and said that it was &amp;#39;&amp;#39;his fair share anyways&amp;#39;&amp;#39;, which my husband should have given him. My son never got along well with him or his family, so he refused and said it&amp;#39;s his, and he&amp;#39;s not interested in supporting his daughter&amp;#39;s business. After some back and forth, Tom&amp;#39;s wife continued about how we should be more supportive of her as it&amp;#39;s hard enough to start a business as a woman. My son refused, and Tom said to me &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Good job on raising a misogynist&amp;#39;&amp;#39;. I was silent. At some point they dropped it and focused on the game, but they kept throwing stray remarks at my husband for leaving him nothing in his will. They weren&amp;#39;t upfront enough to catch attention, but I couldn&amp;#39;t take it, and I asked them to stop. They didn&amp;#39;t. I had enough, and badly needed an outlet. I ended up crying. Tom, wife and daughter gave me an earful for making everything about myself again, said that I should put living relatives over a dead person, that it&amp;#39;s been 25 years, I need to move on, and left. They&amp;#39;re badmouthing me in the group chat and want me to apologize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, AITA? Should I apologize?&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"My girlfriend (29F) and I (27M) are building a new house on a plot we purchased. We decided to do it ourselves with help from family members experienced in construction.

I didn’t expect her to work on the construction site since she’s not handy. Instead, I asked her to handle cooking and occasionally help out. It’s her house as well, and family support has saved us a lot money.

Unfortunately, she seems unwilling and ungrateful. She rarely helps beyond her duties—when I ask her to assist with tasks like cleaning up the yard, she gets stressed and limits her help to an hour or two a month, while I work on the house almost every day. Once, I asked her to pick up lunch for my dad while helping, and she couldn’t even manage the extra 10-minute trip, although he is working for free. 

She blames me for her unwillingness, claiming I set unrealistic expectations and referencing past issues. She says she never realized it would be this hard before committing, but she contributes very little, leaving me to work 50-60 hours a week.

I understand she has ADHD, a full-time job, and an upcoming exam, and I’m considerate of that. However, I’m feeling overwhelmed and undervalued. I’m afraid to ask her for help to avoid arguments, often giving in to keep the peace.

,AmItheAsshole,"So, I (f21) started talking to this guy last January. Despite him being a bit younger, things were going well… until they weren’t. Turns out, his friends at work had been talking all kinds of trash about me, making it awkward to even show up there. And he? Just let it slide, never once standing up for me. Strike one.

Then there’s the fact that he wasn’t exactly honest with me. He’d told me he was single while he was off in another city for college, only for me to find out later that he was actually seeing someone else. So, I cut things off, deciding I was better off without the drama.

But then, out of nowhere, he reaches out with a casual “hey,” acting like all of that never happened. He even says, “Damn, but I’m actually here now.” I was like, Cut to the chase already. So I told him straight up: the reason I don’t feel comfortable at work is because of him and his friends, who’ve been throwing shade based on all these lies he’d been feeding me.

I also told him he’s insecure and that it wasn’t a good look—especially when I tried to be nice before and tell him he deserved someone who actually liked him for him. His response? “Actually, I don’t.” Like, what? The insecurity was real, and it was definitely not something I wanted to deal with.

I ended the chat by saying I wasn’t interested in meeting up, wished him luck, and figured that was that. He tried to keep the door open, saying I could message him “if I ever wanted to talk,” but I made it pretty clear I was done.

,AmItheAsshole,"I wish I was kidding… but I’m not.

We’ve been together 8 years. For the first 4?ish years, he wouldn’t *go* when I was around. Obviously the longer we spent together made that an impossible/silly expectation.

We bought a 1 bath house 4 years ago and…. Let’s just say the fan doesn’t work too well. 

So, I bought Poo-pouri as a thoughtful gesture, imagining that he was aware/embarrassed by the stench of his morning routine…

Well. Turns out he is not. Idk if it’s a boy thing or a biological thing, but the scent does not impact him. 

Meanwhile, I catch myself dry-heaving after just walking past the bathroom while he is in it. It is that bad.

So, I started suggesting he make use of the poo-pouri I bought. At first he laughed and seemed embarrassed, and would often run and shut the door if I mentioned the smell. This lasted for about 1-2 years.

But recently, his morning routine has turned into a fight. It’s like a race to the bathroom in the morning, just so I can pee and brush my teeth in peace without vomiting…

And now when I ask him to use Poo-pouri, he says that I am nagging him and annoying him.

Meanwhile I feel that it is so easy to spray a little toilet perfume and maybe flush twice…

I just want to be able to breathe in my own house without gagging. Is it a lack of respect for me? Or does he just honestly not know how bad it is?

TLDR- AITA for asking my fiancé to try to cover his #2 stench?

,AmItheAsshole,"My friends and I (all 21 F) Let’s call them Jada and Elsa. Over the years Jada has cheated, consistently lead guys on, treated her friends as if they were below her, and other things along the lines of making poor decisions without learning from her mistakes. 

Jada got out of long term relationship toxic relationships. She told us she cared about him but wasn’t happy. Towards the end of the relationship she started to talk to other guys. She said it was just platonic but we told her it wasn’t okay and that she needed to end things with her boyfriend.
She took a trip w/ her college to another country. We told Jada she should end things w/ her bf before but she disagreed. She didn’t talk to her bf very frequently when she was gone either. She met a guy there let’s call him Troy. Jada and Troy grew pretty close. She would tell us she felt some type of way about him and we told her to not do anything stupid. They end up hooking up. She even asked us “so should i not hook up w/ Troy again”. We told her she needs to call her bf, say what happened, and break up w/ him. A few days later they broke up and have been no contact(he did also cheat a while back but two wrongs don’t make a right in this situation). She was affected by the break up and hasn’t let herself heal. She was still talking to Troy pretty consistently after getting home. As well as other guys but Troy was falling for her HARD. We would tell her that she isn’t fully healed enough to start a new relationship now. She went to go visit Troy. He even paid for her plane ticket. When she got back he asked what they were and she couldn’t give him a solid answer. After this we were fed up with all of these actions and told Jada how we felt. 

The conversation started pretty civil. But quickly flipped to us arguing w/ her. Specifically about how we weren’t listening to her/how we can’t tell her what to do.  Personal things were brought up in the argument too. Like her choosing guys over us. We all live in different states so we have to put in an effort to see each other. But she would put more effort into seeing guys than seeing us. We brought up how she would put us down to make herself seem better. And how we felt hurt by that. Things ended in nothing being resolved and we didn’t talk for a week. She texted us saying she understands we want to help her but we should apologize to her for being harsh and unsympathetic. Elsa apologized to her for the approach and a few other things. I did not. I felt as if i wasn’t the one in the wrong and I shouldn’t have to apologize for trying to help. The point of the conversation was to say her behavior isn’t healthy, she’s going to look back at this time and regret it, and how her actions hurt us. It’s been at least a month or more and we haven’t talked to Jada since. I would also like to add that some of the things i said in the argument were out of pocket but they were things I needed to get off my chest. AITA for not apologizing to her?

,AmItheAsshole,"I’ve been getting stalked &amp; harassed since 2019 by an angry forever alone. I’m married, I love my husband, he &amp; I want nothing to do with the stalker. 

This Stalker must have spent a year &amp; a half after I told him I wasn’t interested &amp; blocked him making new accounts, sending unwanted “lonely” DMs &amp; telling me he refuses to believe I’m not interested in him. I called the police who told me to take the account down at which point he got a hold of my number. I changed it &amp; he did the same thing over half a dozen times. One time my dad was visiting &amp; we walked up the front steps &amp; Stalker was standing on the landing looking at my front door. We called the police, building security filed a report &amp; I moved. 

All I’ve ever said to this idiot is “no”, “not interested”, “stop”, “you’re creepy” &amp; “go away”. 

I was repeatedly EXTREMELY polite initially about not wanting the stalker to flirt with me. He used to come on &amp; just OBSESS because I wouldn’t share a ton beyond the fact I was seeing someone (who I married within a handful of years). Finally the other day I just politely said “you know, this fixation with your feelings about my husband have to stop, Stalker. This isn’t appropriate, I’m tired of constantly watching what I say so Stalker doesn’t get triggered over my marriage (my FIRST priority) disrupts his fantasy of pretending he didn’t fling a bunch of unreciprocated sexual energy at a married woman (then dating) who is absolutely in love with her partner. 

I wasn’t mean, I wasn’t cruel. I was matter of fact. 

Now the stalker is screeching at me I should take it down. He keeps trying to claim my assuming the unwanted messages, conversation attempts, texts, calls, invasion into my life is the product of some sick attraction Stalker SAID he felt way more than I ever wanted to hear is just as bad as him saying I must have a crush on him because I said “no thanks”.  He keeps claiming his incessant unwanted attempts to reach out to me were “jokes”. I told him right when he started bothering me I didn’t find it funny &amp; he kept flirting anyway. Honestly, NO. I don’t want to take it down, I didn’t say anything wrong or untrue. I don’t buy anybody takes a “joke” this far. 

I think Stalker’s argument is the attempt of a deeply delusional man to intimidate a woman into not telling it as it is. I think Stalker had a fantasy of getting some female attention &amp; I think Stalker is angry me &amp; my husband telling him to stop disrupts that. I’m tired of Stalker responding my trying to convince me my husband doesn’t actually love me &amp; that I’m the delusional party. My husband &amp; I love each other we don’t run away from each other screaming “No” the way we have both done so from Stalker.

Had a really shit last 24 hours for reasons beyond my control (having a terrible night despite going to bed early, having a tonne of things to do in the morning while being physically exhausted, the incompetence of multiple companies directly affecting me in negative ways yesterday and today, those companies making it hell to file a complaint, and a lot of traffic and idiot drivers).

My way of coping with bad moods is to isolate myself. I'm an introvert, and being around people (other than my wife and occasionally other close people) makes me uncomfortable at the best of times (not crippling anxiety, just discomfort); when I'm in a foul mood, I get snappy and irritable and I try to avoid being around even my wife in order to avoid saying something hurtful unwarrantedly. (I know, it's something I need to work on, and I am. It's a process, and I'm not yet there.) Plus being alone just helps the anger go away faster, I guess.

She did ask what was wrong earlier and offered her support, which helped because I was able to vent some, but ultimately there was nothing either of us could do about any of the things that went wrong yesterday and today and so I was still rather upset.

I have a five-day trip out of town tomorrow, and the wife isn't coming with. Before going to bed (she's a very early bird), she mentioned she found it weird that I'd let my frustration from the horrible day get the better of me; she would have liked to spend some time together after she got off from work, seeing as we won't see each other for the next five days. It isn't a *long* time, but we're very close and we don't usually spend more than a day or two apart every few months, and we both like it that way. We don't spend every waking minute together, of course, but we both think it's just nice to know your significant other is in the same city as you if you need anything.

I reacted defensively to her comment, as though she'd started complaining, which she didn't really; I shouldn't have reacted like that. That said, what I told her stands: my way of coping with being angry is to be alone until the anger has gone away, and she knows this is part of the way I am.

I wasn't angry *at her*, mind, but I'd still have been snappy and potentially hurtful. I know my flaws. As I said, I'm working on it.

This has caused MULTIPLE fights over the years as she feels entitled to get mad at me when I get drunk at a party, or even with my friends at my place. And the same goes for going out to a bar to listen to live bands.

It's been years since she wanted to go out with me, answering every non-dinner invitation to a late-night couple's activity (getting a beer, watching live bands at a bar, going clubbing together) with a cold ""Nah, that's not my deal"".

While trying to accept her for who she is and making an effort not to force her into participating in things she doesn't want to, I've been going out on my own for years, and every time, it's been cause for fighting.

She hated that I went out alone (although there was never cheating or flirting with women, I just like to make friends), and she wasn't willing to ever join me. What was I supposed to do? My friends are ageing a bit fast, and now they usually leave most plans at 11 pm, so going out with them isn't an option.

Since she was always fighting with me and breaking up with me over and over throughout the years, I decided to start lying about where I was or whether I was drunk. She caught me in a lie more than once and said she couldn't trust me anymore, hence her leaving. I'm fighting to keep the appartment because, for one, she's the one who ended the relationship, and she's also much more financially stable than me.

She has a rich dad who's been supporting her 100% financially while telling her to save every penny she makes. This has led to her saving a lot of money for her age. I, on the other hand, have no one to help me out and am still paying my student loans and other debts. I'm broke and have zero savings because of my situation, and she's loaded, has a rich dad, and makes twice as much as me most months.

My reasoning for keeping the house is:

1. She decided to end the relationship
2. She's more than capable of covering moving expenses, as well as 2-month deposits for rent and the expenses for documentation. Both because she has her rich dad and her savings. We're also childless, so no one is losing their childhood home.

There's a lot more context to this, but I'm about to reach the character limit. 



**TL;DR**: She ended the relationship. I'm broke, she's loaded and has a rich dad to help her out, whereas I can't afford to move and give a deposit on a new apartment.

,AmItheAsshole,"So my parents live with me, my husband and our 4yr old son in our home, and have done so for 2 years now.

Now the entire time they have been here they have constantly been negative, criticizing and complaining; trying to get involved in our finances; judging us for what we buy and for even spending our own money; absolute no respect for our belongings; trying to take over parenting our son; bullying our son by belittling his feelings and mocking/shaming him when he's upset; giving unsolicited advice and when we don't accept it they give the silent treatment; and complaining to people about us behind our back.

We brought all of this up and told them their behavior was not ok.. and to please stop treating us both like children, we're nearly 40; please stop telling us what to do if we want your advice we'll ask; and please don't treat our son that way or undermine our parenting, just because our way of parenting is different to yours doesn't mean it's wrong. This didn't go down well and my dad didn't speak to us for 3 weeks, then the behaviour just continued.

It became a toxic environment and was really affecting mine and my husbands mental health, let alone our son's mental health and behaviour.

Our son is also anaphylactic to dairy and we have a rule that our home is completely dairy free. Our home is his safe place where we can all relax and not worry. My parents agreed to this rule as a condition of living with us.

We tried our hardest to make it work but our last straw was finding dairy food items in their room. We brought it up, told them it was blatant disrespect for us, our home and most importantly our son's safety and they used every excuse possible to justify their actions. So we asked them to move out.

Our child's safety is priority and our mental health was suffering. They were just ignoring every single boundary we asked them respect so it was time for them to go.

&lt;p&gt;Now the entire time they have been here they have constantly been negative, criticizing and complaining; trying to get involved in our finances; judging us for what we buy and for even spending our own money; absolute no respect for our belongings; trying to take over parenting our son; bullying our son by belittling his feelings and mocking/shaming him when he&amp;#39;s upset; giving unsolicited advice and when we don&amp;#39;t accept it they give the silent treatment; and complaining to people about us behind our back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We brought all of this up and told them their behavior was not ok.. and to please stop treating us both like children, we&amp;#39;re nearly 40; please stop telling us what to do if we want your advice we&amp;#39;ll ask; and please don&amp;#39;t treat our son that way or undermine our parenting, just because our way of parenting is different to yours doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s wrong. This didn&amp;#39;t go down well and my dad didn&amp;#39;t speak to us for 3 weeks, then the behaviour just continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became a toxic environment and was really affecting mine and my husbands mental health, let alone our son&amp;#39;s mental health and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our son is also anaphylactic to dairy and we have a rule that our home is completely dairy free. Our home is his safe place where we can all relax and not worry. My parents agreed to this rule as a condition of living with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried our hardest to make it work but our last straw was finding dairy food items in their room. We brought it up, told them it was blatant disrespect for us, our home and most importantly our son&amp;#39;s safety and they used every excuse possible to justify their actions. So we asked them to move out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our child&amp;#39;s safety is priority and our mental health was suffering. They were just ignoring every single boundary we asked them respect so it was time for them to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now they&amp;#39;re acting like we&amp;#39;re the bad guys and telling everyone that will listen that we&amp;#39;re the bad guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So AITA for putting our son and our family ahead of them and their need for accommodation? Or are they for treating us like shit and trying to walk all over us?&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"I (m 19) am getting ready to move out of the house and has recently been evaluating how I live and what habits I want to take with me and leave behind. So far, I’ve noticed so much improvement on myself (making yoga a daily thing, limiting screen time and activity making space for hobbies that I’ve neglected)

As I am doing this I’ve started to notice my family members habits and realized that we are stuck in screen hell. I’m going to focus on my mom in this post but both my dad and younger sibling are really bad about this too. 

My mom (f 47) is a stay at home mom mostly due to her disability. She has Multiple Sclerosis, diagnosed before I was born, and has lost a considerable about of balance and mobility. Along with other health factors, this has lead her to be in her power chair for 95% of her day. From when she wakes up to when she goes to bed she is in her chair, she can stand and walk, but has to use either a walker, or her cane and my arm to do so. Even then, standing causes her intense back pain.

She has struggled with mental health problems for her whole life, issues relating to anxiety, depression, a suspected binge eating disorder, and possibly adhd. 

All of these factors has lead to her daily routine looking something like this: wake up, get dressed, crochet (or another intense interest she has like beading) all day while snacking and scrolling through the most brain rotted Facebook reels you’ve ever seen (ghost hunting gone wrong, aita stories that are so fake (lol),etc.), make dinner when she has enough energy, and then bed. She has to have audio every second she’s awake because she said “I’d rather be entertained than be alone with my thoughts.”

It’s been like this since Covid hit, but before I didn’t notice how bad it was because I was similar, just going to school. 

I’m am now so concerned that she is getting to the point where there’s no coming back. I’ve pleaded with her to take screen breaks and practice her physical therapy exercises, get PROFESSIONAL mental health support that is not just “5 signs you have adhd” shorts, anything. But I fear it’s not going to happen. 

I’m scared she won’t change for the better. I want her to be here for as long as possible, and I know that will be especially hard with her disability. So today I confided in my worries with her, but she didn’t seem to care. She cared that I was upset, but I don’t think she fully understood my concerns. Right after the talk she went back to her reels. 

I feel like the asshole cause I’ve dug her deeper into the pit of self hatred and she’s not a good mom, but all I want for her to to take back her life.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (29F) and my husband (29M) found out we were pregnant in April, six weeks after my sister announced her pregnancy. We were all thrilled, imagining our kids growing up as best friends. Unfortunately, in June, we had a miscarriage. It was our second miscarriage that year, and it hit us hard. I struggled deeply, even having dark thoughts about ending my life. We tried to cope by booking a trip, listening to podcasts, attending therapy, and joining support groups, which helped somewhat.

After the miscarriage, we became a bit distant from the family because I couldn’t bear to see my sister pregnant. Whenever we went out to dinner, where we usually talked and shared about our lives, we just couldn’t engage in conversations anymore. Most of the time, we went home early because it was too painful to see them. People would ask how her pregnancy was going, and she would share moments about her ultrasounds, check-ups, and milestones. We couldn’t participate in these conversations or even try to be happy for her because it triggered me and made me cry.

Three months later, my sister’s wedding was approaching, followed by her baby shower/gender reveal the next day. We informed them in advance that while we would attend the wedding and celebrate with them, we couldn’t make it to the baby shower. Being around pregnant women is a trigger for me, reminding me of our loss. They seemed to understand but hoped we might change our minds, especially since my husband's family was coming to support us.

We attended the wedding, brought a gift, picked up their wedding cake, and celebrated their special day. However, the next morning, my older sister (not the pregnant one) sent me a long message, essentially saying, “Your sister was there for you during your milestones, why can’t you be there for her now? Focus your energy on her and move on already.” I was devastated, feeling like a bad sister, and cried my eyes out. My husband was furious at the insensitivity and realized this was how the whole family felt.

Now, we are seen as the bad guys for not attending the baby shower. So, AITA for not being there for my sister during her special day?

,AmItheAsshole,"A couple weeks ago, my roommates (21F) and I (21F) decided to go out to our college bars. My purse had broken a couple nights before so I asked one of my roommates if I could borrow one of hers. She said yes and set out all of the ones she had and said I could pick. I picked out one and asked if it was okay that I borrowed that specific one. She said yes and we both went back to getting ready for the night. We go out and all seems fine until a guy that I have been seeing for a while, John (22M), met us out around an hour in. Some information, I’ve known John for a couple years but have only started going on dates with him for about a week. We are all hanging out in a pretty big group until a song comes on that all the girls love. John isn’t dancing and is standing out of the way so naturally I pass the purse off my shoulder and ask if he could hold it for me. He said yes and I double checked that he had it before I went to dance with my girls. A couple minutes later my roommate jabs me in the shoulder and yells “go get my purse from him right the fuck now”. I didn’t question it and went right to go get it. However, as soon as I come back she’s screaming at our friends saying that I’m a “selfish cunt” and a “stupid bitch” for giving her things to a random guy. I told her that if she was going to continue to yell that we needed to go outside because we were in the middle of the bar and we’re going to get kicked out with her acting like that. We leave and she’s still yelling about how awful a person I am until we decide to go our separate ways. I go home with some of our other roommates and she stays out. The next morning I wake up and she texted me demanding for an apology for the disrespect I caused her. I genuinely was just looking out for her things and ensuring it didn’t get damaged or anything while I was dancing. Also, if anyone is owed an apology I believe it’s me for the names she called me. So, Reddit am I the asshole? 
EDIT: adding some information, after my roommate asked for the apology she told me that the purse was $2,000 and that it was a gift from her mom. I had absolutely no idea about the importance of the purse before I had asked to borrow it and my roommate didn’t mention it to me until after. Had I known about its importance and how it was a gift I never would have asked for it. I even double checked with her before I took it out of her room and she told me it was fine for me to borrow. Also, while we were out it had none of her belongings in it at the time. No IDs, no money, no lipstick or lipgloss. Only my things were in it when I gave it to John to hold. Where I might be the asshole is my roommate didn’t know John well and had only met him twice before that night. I can see where she might be upset because she didn’t trust him as much as I did just because she didn’t know him as well.

My purse had broken a couple nights before so I asked one of my roommates if I could borrow one of hers. She said yes and set out all of the ones she had and said I could pick. I picked out one and asked if it was okay that I borrowed that specific one. She said yes and we both went back to getting ready for the night. We go out and all seems fine until a guy that I have been seeing for a while, John (22M), met us out around an hour in. Some information, I’ve known John for a couple years but have only started going on dates with him for about a week. We are all hanging out in a pretty big group until a song comes on that all the girls love. John isn’t dancing and is standing out of the way so naturally I pass the purse off my shoulder and ask if he could hold it for me. He said yes and I double checked that he had it before I went to dance with my girls. A couple minutes later my roommate jabs me in the shoulder and yells “go get my purse from him right the fuck now”. I didn’t question it and went right to go get it. However, as soon as I come back she’s screaming at our friends saying that I’m a “selfish cunt” and a “stupid bitch” for giving her things to a random guy. I told her that if she was going to continue to yell that we needed to go outside because we were in the middle of the bar and we’re going to get kicked out with her acting like that. We leave and she’s still yelling about how awful a person I am until we decide to go our separate ways. I go home with some of our other roommates and she stays out. The next morning I wake up and she texted me demanding for an apology for the disrespect I caused her. I genuinely was just looking out for her things and ensuring it didn’t get damaged or anything while I was dancing. Also, if anyone is owed an apology I believe it’s me for the names she called me. So, Reddit am I the asshole?

,AmItheAsshole,"Hi everyone,

I would love to get some outside opinion on whether AITA in a fight I’m (30s F) having with my partner (30s M).

For context, I’m in a relationship with my partner for about two years. Before that, I was in a seven year relationship with a guy who emotionally cheated on me for the majority of our time together. 
Right before I got together with my current partner I had moved from a big city to a smaller one and my partner knows that I didn’t have the easiest time adjusting to the environment here. My professional network here is very small on confined to the people I meet at my job—having a network is important for me and the type of work I do. 

Onto the issue. Today I stumbled upon a local article that talked about a person in my industry and I recognized her name from a time when I used to live in the larger city. She does the same type of work I do, but we never met personally, but I know _of_ her as we both used to live in the larger city for a while. So we kinda knew the same people, I remember her name but idk if she knows mine, that type of thing. I remember her distinctly because my ex, the guy I was with for a long time, was “friends” with her. At least that’s what he told me. I found out later that he had secretly met with her, went to dinner with her, was ultra sweet and cute to her. In short, he had a crush on her and was trying to land with her, despite being in a relationship with me at that time. She, however wanted to be friends and always turned him down (I know because I read his texts, arrest me). Eventually, their “friendship” faded and my ex moved onto the next person to (try to) cheat with.

Anyhow, I realized that none of this was really her fault and that she is her own person regardless of what my ex thought of her, and so I decided to reach out. My motive was, we’re in the same small city, have both spent significant years of our career in the larger one, and we do the same type of work. Why not meet up for a coffee. I briefly chatted to my good friend, asking their opinion if that’s weird given the history with my ex, but even my friend assured me that after all it wasn’t mine or the woman’s baggage but my ex’s. 

Later in the day, I told my partner. And I know that he is very sensitive every time I mention my ex so I gave him the caveat of that this might be a sensitive thing before I told him exactly what I wrote up here. And he got so upset! He said it’s weird, and he said that I’m constantly trying to find ways to keep my ex in my life. And then later he said it’s weird that I asked my friend first before I consulted him. He also says that I asked my friend for permission, which is not true. I just wanted an opinion. My partner says that now he can’t say he doesn’t want me to message her because I already did and that I “always do whatever I want no matter how he feels”. He says his opinion doesn’t matter to me and I would’ve ignored it anyways. He is of the opinion that if a person is uncomfortable with their partner meeting someone/hanging out with someone/speaking to someone etc. and they say that, that the respectful thing of the partner is to follow that request and not meet up/hang out/talk. He says if I requested this from him then he would not do it out of respect for me and for not wanting to hurt me. We clearly have a difference in opinion here because I don’t even think there’s anything weird going on. My ex isn’t even in the country anymore and this woman clearly didn’t want anything from him. And even if, what does it have to do with my partner. Ahhhh.

So now I’m sitting here and wondering AITA for having tried to connect with this woman?

My parents have been bugging me and my wife for years about grandkids because both my female cousins are married with kids but they took their husband's last names. I'm the only way our family name will go on because even though I have a younger brother he's super duper gay like think big gay Al from south park and that's not a dig at him it's just a very accurate way to describe him.

Me and my dad were drinking and working on a car in his garage last week and the subject of kids came up for the millionth time. I'd had a bit of whiskey and I let it slip that I'd went and gotten snipped which probably wasn't a great idea. He dropped the tool he had in his hand and looked like he'd just seen a ghost and stammered out ""you did what"".

I reiterated what I'd said and he went red in the face and said I was singlehandedly ending our family name and I was beyond selfish to do that. We had some words and I ended up leaving because it got heated. My mom called later to talk and after explaining my side she said that she wouldn't say she was happy about it but she would respect my decision.

Our main reason for not wanting kids is seeing how our close friends who have kids have drastically changed. They all seem burnt out all the time and their relationships have taken a hit as well and they have no time for things they used to do. One couple we've known for years is on the verge of divorce with the husband saying they haven't been intimate in 2 years and they never do anything as a couple like dates or even sleeping in the same bed when they were the perfect loving couple before the kid.

My wife and I have a great relationship with plenty of intimacy and we do things all the time like spontaneous dates, day trips, and we have hobbies we like doing together. I don't want to trade all that for a screaming miniature human that shits their pants and seems to be the catalyst for our friends rocky marriages. so AITAH?

One criticism was valid but most were made based on assumptions about what I did or didn't do simply because I didn't talk about it in the original post. I'm genuinely curious if I am to blame for many of these problems was there any significant room for me to have done better?

My Mother-in-Law is Living with Us, and It's a Nightmare – Need Advice

 

 

Hey Reddit, I’m in a really tough situation right now and could use some outside perspective. My mother-in-law (MIL) is currently living with my wife and me, and it’s been nothing short of a nightmare. I thought I could handle it as long as I do what I need to do and show utmost respect to her, but it’s becoming unbearable.

 

\### Background

To give you some context, my wife comes from a single-parent family. Her parents divorced while she was away in college, and she sided with her mother, who has her own family issues. My MIL's siblings are - according to her story anyway – dishonest, irresponsible and manipulative, and dumped the responsibility of caring for their mother onto her only, which may have contributed to her perception that everyone else is that way, too. This background adds an extra layer of complexity to our current situation.

 

\### Current Situation

Here are the facts:

\- Overbearing Behavior: My MIL is controlling and emotionally unstable. She often cuts people off mid-sentence and makes petty comments. Her overbearingness is sometimes matched by her occasional displays of insecurity and inferiority complex. It feels like she thinks she owns the house we pay for and has been openly opposed to my wife and my marriage from the start. She has some strangely un-adult-like behaviors and lack of common sense or social graces. For instance, the \*first time\* she met my aunt (my mom's younger sister) she badmouthed my mom and me - my aunt's own sister and nephew - to her.

\- Tension with Family: We hired a nanny to take care of our daughter for 1 year before she could enroll in KinderCare. My parents have generously covered half of our nanny's fee. However, the nanny behaved disrespectfully towards both my wife and MIL. She seemed to think that my wife and MIL had similar economic and educational background as herself and almost acted as if they were her own personal assistants. Sometimes the image of Stephen from Django staring angrily at Django comes to mind (sorry, this is grossly inappropriate). She would engage in quarrels with my MIL and eventually MIL had to spell it out for her “I have money and I have education; you and I are not the same” which the nanny took personally. When the nanny left without notice about 6 months into her service, my mother made a tone-deaf comment praising her, which only enraged my wife and MIL. They then believed my parents encouraged the nanny to leave so they wouldn’t have to pay more.

\- Family Meetings: Things escalated when my MIL demanded a family meeting to discuss the future of our daughter’s care now that the nanny left us stranded. My mother declined, feeling it undermined their authority as elders, having me and my wife in the presence of that ‘summit meeting’. I personally think it was unwise to refuse the suggestion and didn’t think a calm discussion would hurt (assuming it would stay calm, that is). In any case, this refusal was taken as a sign of insincerity and arrogance on my parents' part, and MIL’s daily attitude towards me has become increasingly aggressive.

\- Threats and Violence: My MIL hates pets, and I own two cats that had been with me since the early 2010’s. She’s been mean and threatening towards them, even kicking one of them once. Another time she has jokingly remarked about taking a club to my parents’ house to ""show them what’s what,"" and has mentioned slapping my wife’s father in the past, some time before their divorce, which raises concerns about her impulsive and violent tendencies.

 

\### My Feelings

While my wife is caught in the middle, I can’t help but feel that she finds some comfort and perverted satisfaction in her mother’s presence, almost like a lapdog who found her way home. She used to half jokingly say “mom is visiting me again, so now somebody can protect me from you and your parents’ bullying”. The most my mom did to supposedly bully her is to (1) offer advice on raising our daughter and to be fair she had experience raising 4 kids since she herself was a kid: her young sisters when she was young and myself and my brother decades later, while my MIL had no experience – she dumped my wife on the grandparents during her childhood while she pursued her professional career, and only came back to her life when my wife was a teenager; (2) my mom made a praising remark about the nanny. The nanny sent my mom a message saying she’s sorry for leaving early and expressed how much she genuinely cared for our toddler. My mom then promptly shared a screenshot of the message with us saying “it’s a shame things didn’t work out with her but at least she really cares for your baby”, but to my wife and MIL’s ear it basically sounded like “it’s too bad the nanny disrespected you and your mother and treated you like other nannies but hey at least she apologized to ME!”. The second one is admittedly very egregious, stupid, and again, tone-deaf.

 

This dynamic is incredibly frustrating for me, as it feels like I’m being sidelined in my own home. Additionally, my parents think I’m too good for my wife. This is obviously hurtful to know, but I try not to dwell on it too much because I think it’s natural for any parent to feel that way about their child. However, they’ve never expressed that sentiment directly to her. She just knows they feel that way - or her insecurity led her to form the right conclusion, I don’t know - and it bothers her too. I’ve also noticed that my wife and her MIL feel that my parents do not treat them as real family, which has led to misunderstandings. My mom has made some comments about my wife’s appearance and fashion sense, which my wife finds hurtful. After the nanny debacle and my mom’s emotionally unintelligent input it only reinforced the idea in my wife head that she’s not real family and is even “lower than the help” in some ways.

 

\### My Frustrations

To be honest, I’ve always thought my wife was a bit dull. I must admit that I am not entirely innocent in all of this. Our marriage is, quite frankly, one of laziness on my part. We don’t have any real common interests or hobbies or books we both like, not because we liked different things and they do not align, but because she simply doesn’t have any hobbies, or interests, nor is she well-read. When she complains/claims my parents see her as a nanny or rube, and I often stop short of saying “then stop dressing like one” for fear of that comment being irreversible. In my mind I know frugality is a virtue and a good thing, and that she has it and I don’t, but my vanity would still make me embarrassed when I think of the fact that she doesn’t dress well, doesn’t wear makeup, doesn’t do anything to remove the little whiskers on her upper lip and is the only young woman I know that doesn’t have any type of ear piercing. The main reason I married her was a simple one – she was easy to talk to, nice, and didn’t give me any aggravation. It’s quite sad but I never believed in love and didn’t bother looking for it. Now having this MIL following us around all the time yields a net aggravation on my life which defeats the only purpose of this marriage. And if my motivation in this marriage saddens you, annoys you, makes me seem like a self-centered and irresponsible jerk, it should. And I applaud and appreciate you for your right mindset. Don’t be like me.

Currently, I’m going through my MIL’s third consecutive half-year visit. Despite my efforts to keep the peace, she finds new things to be upset about every day. For example, today, when I was looking at what ingredients we have in the fridge, she complained I was looking at it for too long. It’s my house and my fridge! I explained I was just thinking of what to cook, but she stormed off and refused to acknowledge me for the rest of the day. Didn’t like my tone, or the fact that I dared to talk back, or both, I guess. I think that might be the last straw. In the past, I admit there were plenty of things I could’ve handled better. I could have been more accommodating as a host, but today is different because I didn’t do anything wrong. In fact this whole week I’d been extremely careful not to hurt her fragile sensibilities.

\### My Dilemma

Here’s where my dilemma lies: While I can ask her to leave or tell my wife she’s not welcome, I fear that would lead to my wife divorcing me and trying to take our daughter. I’ve never tried to prevent my wife from seeing her mother; I’ve suggested they visit her in her home or that she can buy a place nearby. But I suspect my wife would rather take our child than allow me to live without her mother’s aggravation.  

 

\### Seeking Advice

Given the escalating situation, I’m seriously considering the possibility of evicting my MIL. If I were to go down that route, what’s the best way to do it? What precautions, including those pertaining to personal safety, should I take? I don’t want things to get messy or dangerous, but should I buy a gun? Additionally, if my wife decides to fight me for custody of our daughter, what type of legal precautions should I take to strengthen my case? Should I record conversations that demonstrate my MIL’s mental instability and how it would create a harmful environment for my child? I’m feeling trapped and frustrated. This situation is creating a lot of tension, and I don’t know how to address it without escalating things further. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you cope? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for your help. I’d be happy to answer any questions or fill in any blanks.

  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: I see some comments remarking how I didn't defend or stand up for my wife. I didn't talk about me standing up for my wife from my mother's microaggression because they're not very relevant to this story. My wife felt that she was 'lower than the help' because (1) she assumed my parents encouraged the nanny's disrepect and because (2) my mother (whom my wife already suspected of sabotage), in her infinite inability to read the room, said something positive about the nanny right after she ditched us, and also (3) because of something my dad said:

Right after my mother texted some nice words about that nanny in the family group text, my wife replied complaining about what the nanny did and what her faults were, but did it in a highly sarcastic and passive-aggressive way, while insinuating my mom was behind it all. Sensing that things were getting unfriendly, my dad chimed in basically saying ""I see, in that case it's probably a good thing that she left"" referring to the fact you obviously won't want to eat food prepared by someone who is angry at you or have that person handle kitchen knives, or have access to your house key, or look after the baby! But somehow my wife interpreted that, again, as some sort of defense of the nanny and snapped at my dad, which both angered and confused him because he was trying to diffuse the situation. After that, they didn't talk for weeks while I tried to work things out and talk to everybody and clarify what everyone meant (while the MIL worked against me by feeding my wife more venom). Eventually, after the MIL left, things improved between my wife and my parents, which never would've happened while MIL was here fanning the flames.

Mind you, to this day, my parents never chastised her for her reaction that day. They did let bygones be bygones and never brought it up again.  

  
As for previous microaggressive remarks my mom said in earlier years, I ALWAYS protested them verbally and physically too, by getting up and leaving immediately as soon as she started to do that. I'd even tell my dad about it and they would argue severely afterwards. Of course my wife doesn't know my father defended her because I'd never tell her my mother said those things about her in the first place. But my mom never learned the lesson until my wife flipped out at her; only then did she take it seriously. Some time ago I said to mom ""I told you so"". She didn't respond.

&lt;p&gt;My Mother-in-Law is Living with Us, and It&amp;#39;s a Nightmare – Need Advice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey Reddit, I’m in a really tough situation right now and could use some outside perspective. My mother-in-law (MIL) is currently living with my wife and me, and it’s been nothing short of a nightmare. I thought I could handle it as long as I do what I need to do and show utmost respect to her, but it’s becoming unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;### Background&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you some context, my wife comes from a single-parent family. Her parents divorced while she was away in college, and she sided with her mother, who has her own family issues. My MIL&amp;#39;s siblings are - according to her story anyway – dishonest, irresponsible and manipulative, and dumped the responsibility of caring for their mother onto her only, which may have contributed to her perception that everyone else is that way, too. This background adds an extra layer of complexity to our current situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;### Current Situation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Overbearing Behavior: My MIL is controlling and emotionally unstable. She often cuts people off mid-sentence and makes petty comments. Her overbearingness is sometimes matched by her occasional displays of insecurity and inferiority complex. It feels like she thinks she owns the house we pay for and has been openly opposed to my wife and my marriage from the start. She has some strangely un-adult-like behaviors and lack of common sense or social graces. For instance, the *first time* she met my aunt (my mom&amp;#39;s younger sister) she badmouthed my mom and me - my aunt&amp;#39;s own sister and nephew - to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Tension with Family: We hired a nanny to take care of our daughter for 1 year before she could enroll in KinderCare. My parents have generously covered half of our nanny&amp;#39;s fee. However, the nanny behaved disrespectfully towards both my wife and MIL. She seemed to think that my wife and MIL had similar economic and educational background as herself and almost acted as if they were her own personal assistants. Sometimes the image of Stephen from Django staring angrily at Django comes to mind (sorry, this is grossly inappropriate). She would engage in quarrels with my MIL and eventually MIL had to spell it out for her “I have money and I have education; you and I are not the same” which the nanny took personally. When the nanny left without notice about 6 months into her service, my mother made a tone-deaf comment praising her, which only enraged my wife and MIL. They then believed my parents encouraged the nanny to leave so they wouldn’t have to pay more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Family Meetings: Things escalated when my MIL demanded a family meeting to discuss the future of our daughter’s care now that the nanny left us stranded. My mother declined, feeling it undermined their authority as elders, having me and my wife in the presence of that ‘summit meeting’. I personally think it was unwise to refuse the suggestion and didn’t think a calm discussion would hurt (assuming it would stay calm, that is). In any case, this refusal was taken as a sign of insincerity and arrogance on my parents&amp;#39; part, and MIL’s daily attitude towards me has become increasingly aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Threats and Violence: My MIL hates pets, and I own two cats that had been with me since the early 2010’s. She’s been mean and threatening towards them, even kicking one of them once. Another time she has jokingly remarked about taking a club to my parents’ house to &amp;quot;show them what’s what,&amp;quot; and has mentioned slapping my wife’s father in the past, some time before their divorce, which raises concerns about her impulsive and violent tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;### My Feelings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my wife is caught in the middle, I can’t help but feel that she finds some comfort and perverted satisfaction in her mother’s presence, almost like a lapdog who found her way home. She used to half jokingly say “mom is visiting me again, so now somebody can protect me from you and your parents’ bullying”. The most my mom did to supposedly bully her is to (1) offer advice on raising our daughter and to be fair she had experience raising 4 kids since she herself was a kid: her young sisters when she was young and myself and my brother decades later, while my MIL had no experience – she dumped my wife on the grandparents during her childhood while she pursued her professional career, and only came back to her life when my wife was a teenager; (2) my mom made a praising remark about the nanny. The nanny sent my mom a message saying she’s sorry for leaving early and expressed how much she genuinely cared for our toddler. My mom then promptly shared a screenshot of the message with us saying “it’s a shame things didn’t work out with her but at least she really cares for your baby”, but to my wife and MIL’s ear it basically sounded like “it’s too bad the nanny disrespected you and your mother and treated you like other nannies but hey at least she apologized to ME!”. The second one is admittedly very egregious, stupid, and again, tone-deaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dynamic is incredibly frustrating for me, as it feels like I’m being sidelined in my own home. Additionally, my parents think I’m too good for my wife. This is obviously hurtful to know, but I try not to dwell on it too much because I think it’s natural for any parent to feel that way about their child. However, they’ve never expressed that sentiment directly to her. She just knows they feel that way - or her insecurity led her to form the right conclusion, I don’t know - and it bothers her too. I’ve also noticed that my wife and her MIL feel that my parents do not treat them as real family, which has led to misunderstandings. My mom has made some comments about my wife’s appearance and fashion sense, which my wife finds hurtful. After the nanny debacle and my mom’s emotionally unintelligent input it only reinforced the idea in my wife head that she’s not real family and is even “lower than the help” in some ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;### My Frustrations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I’ve always thought my wife was a bit dull. I must admit that I am not entirely innocent in all of this. Our marriage is, quite frankly, one of laziness on my part. We don’t have any real common interests or hobbies or books we both like, not because we liked different things and they do not align, but because she simply doesn’t have any hobbies, or interests, nor is she well-read. When she complains/claims my parents see her as a nanny or rube, and I often stop short of saying “then stop dressing like one” for fear of that comment being irreversible. In my mind I know frugality is a virtue and a good thing, and that she has it and I don’t, but my vanity would still make me embarrassed when I think of the fact that she doesn’t dress well, doesn’t wear makeup, doesn’t do anything to remove the little whiskers on her upper lip and is the only young woman I know that doesn’t have any type of ear piercing. The main reason I married her was a simple one – she was easy to talk to, nice, and didn’t give me any aggravation. It’s quite sad but I never believed in love and didn’t bother looking for it. Now having this MIL following us around all the time yields a net aggravation on my life which defeats the only purpose of this marriage. And if my motivation in this marriage saddens you, annoys you, makes me seem like a self-centered and irresponsible jerk, it should. And I applaud and appreciate you for your right mindset. Don’t be like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I’m going through my MIL’s third consecutive half-year visit. Despite my efforts to keep the peace, she finds new things to be upset about every day. For example, today, when I was looking at what ingredients we have in the fridge, she complained I was looking at it for too long. It’s my house and my fridge! I explained I was just thinking of what to cook, but she stormed off and refused to acknowledge me for the rest of the day.

In fact this whole week I’d been extremely careful not to hurt her fragile sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

Last week my best friend 41F-Luna who I 39F work with has a brother 44M working with us. During lunch he left and didn't return. Come to find out he had gotten arrested. The next day she tells me what he was arrested for.

 After lunch one of the other guys we work with calls to ask what happened to her brother. I know I messed up by entertaining the conversation but I said, I'm not exactly sure what happened, but I don't think hes coming back. He took it as he found another job and did a no call no show. So I texted her to let her know the guys were already asking questions and I told her what I said. At the time not thinking it was a bad thing. She got upset that I said something period. I apologized over and over and told her I would talk to her brother and tell him that it was me, that I wanted to make things right. The way she told me about what happened to him was that A, then B and then C happened. About an hour later she texts me saying that all the guys know and that they know everything. A, B and C, that her cousin (who also works with us) is texting her and she sends me the screen shots. I told her I don't know how they found out exactly about A, B and C but it was not me that told them all that, I swear on our friendship. All she said was I trusted you to not say anything. I totally understand, but now she is ignoring me. I told her brother and he said it's ok don't worry about it.

 That happened Friday, Monday I see her at work and waved at her, she just turned around. Today, Tuesday I'm being told by the guys that his mugshot is in the news and they are talking about how did he get caught. I'm thinking to myself, I thought they knew everything? She said they knew everything. Now I'm thinking that because she was so upset that I said something that she just wanted to add more fuel to the fire and say that they knew A, B and C just to make me look even worse. Not including Friday, it's been 4 days that she has been ignoring me and avoiding me at work. 

I've never been in a healthy relationship, but I've been toxic relationships and this is how things were with them. Being completely ignored until they felt like talking to me again.

Yesterday as every day I see the same guy from poland go smoke weed “behind” during the break from my work. Why I know it is weed? Cuz its legal as I know it and I smell it from him slightly when he comes back + his behavior gets chaotic (im thinking there might be extra involved something)…



He is chaotic guy in general. After smoking he came back to our normal smoking area for cigarettes and started shouting “AAAAAAH BRRR ITS COLD”. Because I usually stand alone there and chill on my own, when he passed me he shouted in my face “ITS COLD YEAH” and his friend laughed.

During work he drives forklift. So when he is high… it makes me anxious that he will do something chaotic with it, because he just screams while on it and tries to get everyones attention driving around the warehouse (and he succeeds as a lot find him funny). He is “kind of” safe with the heavy machinery but I dont trust that. He is joking around too much and might lose focus.

Im thinking of reporting him - even if he didnt do much wrong except made the joke on me with this screaming to my face kinda. I dont get in his way much and he is sometimes nice as well. 

Im quitting this workplace soon myself as most managers and team leaders give 0 fucks whats going on there. I even got like the least amount of training there. I also feel uncomfortable as I am the only Lithuanian person around polish and ukrainian. So I cant communicate properly (we are all in the netherlands but i am the one in the whole warehouse out of 10 people who know english… as it is important language in this workplace).

I'm trying to see if I'm the asshole because my wife is pissed at me for having my ex-husband take our daughter (12F) to her yearly Dr. Appointment. It was his week with her he took time off work and took her. My wife believes it was rude and disrespectful of me to have her dad take her when she was having ""female"" problems. She's been have bad cramps. She's doesn't hide this from her dad of she gets them bad at school he will take time off if it's his week and go get her. there is a history of female issues in my family that my ex-husband is well aware of. He's known me and my family for 29 years and seen my sister go through cancer. I also had issue with it while we were married. So this isn't anything unheard of to him. He's involved in her life coach's her track team spends time with her when it's his week, teaches her to cook. Overall he's a good dad. A shit husband to me but a good dad to her. 
I didn't think this was an issue since he's not one of thoes typical ""periods are gross eww"" guys and she's been open with him about her issues and he's sympathetic to it. She knew her dad was taking her and didn't say anything about it. We communicate very well so im fairly certain she would have said something if she was uncomfortable. 
It important to mention in my state full custody doesn't really mean much there are a few things thay are you choice, like the school they go to the religion they practice and a couple other things that I honestly don't remember because they've never been an issue. But one thing is it's against the law to withhold medical or dr type things from the ""non-custodial"" parent. Not that I want to but even if I did it's against family law. 
My ex and I didn't have the best co-parenting relationship at first but we both realized it was doing more damage then anything. We now peacefully co-parent. We are not buddies but we get along enough to both be present. If she has something going on when it's his time or my time we are fine with ""loosing"" time. He's taken her for things when it's my time and I his time. It took us awhile to get here but she is so much happier.
My wife swears it was beyond rude and disrespectful to have her dad take her. I think it's import to mention there is an decent age gap between her and I so im thinking this is a generational gap issue. She grew up where periods were taboo. Everyone knew girls got them but no one talked about it.

,AmItheAsshole,"Hi, I (36) we've beem married  for 5 years and we are globally happy with 2 kids, a 3 months old bby and a 3 years old toddler. I work 100% from home in Tech consulting and usually work around 45 to 50 hours weekly from home. My wife ia in maternity leave taking care of our baby and I usually tke care of our son activities, daycare etc... 

I conaider myself a good father and husband, I do a lot ar home even though I work a lot. Here's an idea of my typical day ... Waking up at 6:30 - 7:30, kid breakfast, all kind of things in the morning, including dishes sometimes. Taking my son to daycare, coming back, working from 8:30 to 5. Stopping, picking up my son, doing all kind of things, dinner, I am usually the one giving him bath and putting him to sleep. After that, I am usually back to work from 8-9 pm to midnight ich ..

Literally the only moments that I go out are to gp to the daycare, grocery, family time and activities for the kids. I wad user to go every week, depends on the day, sometimes friday sometimes thursday, sometimes saturday .. yo have some time withy brother at his house (married too) to smoke cigars, play games and chill. Some months my eife is super chill but most ofthe time she is not relly hppy with me having me time with my brother at his home. House is getting me mentally exhausted and espefially because she always give me ttotudes if I go out and send text messages to mke me feel bad. 

Her exucse is that shebcan't go out alone because of the baby, but the reality is that she goes out during the day, visiting her family, taking.a week vacation abroad with our baby, I know it is not without the baby but at least, she get to go out.

I am at a point where I prefer to take everything on me just to not get her attitude or risking yo start an argument. And I think that going out one a week to visit family (usually between 8 pm to like 1 am) is not a big deal and I should be ble to do this.

What are your thoughts?

,AmItheAsshole,"Quick backstory, I have arthritis in both knees and have been going between the surgeon and my GP at the VA to figure out replacing them. I have a legal and current handicapped parking placard for this.

I pulled into the parking lot of the early voting center in town, and folks were blocking the handicapped parking spot with the line to vote. I pulled up, put my head out the open window, and nicely asked them to move so I could park there. My parking placard was hanging from my rearview mirror.

Folks shuffled there feet and looked like they weren’t going to move when one woman from further back in the line starting yelling for no one to move.

It was a handicapped parking space. Huge symbol painted on the ground. Sign up on the metal post.

I ask again saying it is a legal parking spot and would people please move. I am carefully watching my words at this point.

Again the woman in the back starts yelling I’m wrong and tries to engage me with arguing and when someone went to move she again yelled, for no one to move.

At this point my wife got out of the car to get an election official.

I was pissed and realized this goblin was not going to relent. I explained I was going to call the police for blocking a handicapped parking pot and election interference. She told me I should. She is yelling, cursing and went full ad hominem.

Not going to lie I argued back until I realized her circular logic was making it all about her.

The election worker showed up and had them move the line, explaining they couldn’t block any parking spots. 

Unhappy she had to move and I could park she starts loudly telling the poll worker I was being an insolent asshole. A male voice I hadn’t heard before also screamed I was wrong and made some questionable observations regarding my ancestry.

Having enough I took my shot and condescendingly said, ”Ok sweetie, you should just calm down.” I’m fully aware after decades of marriage this is a move no man should use without a cup, but as fate would have it I was still sitting in my vehicle.

So after I parked and we all headed to the back of the line I picked up one of the four to five chairs along the line for folks who have trouble standing in line.

Immediately, she starts yelling at me that I was not allowed to take the chairs they had put out for other people.

I rolled my eyes in her general direction, walked to the back of the line and sat down in the chair awaiting my turn. She kept clucking for a bit.

Now I’m pissed but I’m also wondering AITA? My wife who is non-confrontational was bothered. My teen was embarrassed her first time voting.

Edit 1: I talked to my kiddo. We talk all the time on topics, I raised her that way and luckily it stuck.  She was embarrassed by the moment but said she would have done the same thing since the woman was pushing hella hard. She understands this is a wilder than normal election seasons. I was relieved to hear she was embarrassed by the moment but not by my actions.

,AmItheAsshole,"My fiancé (22M, now ex-fiancé), Steve (fake name), and I (23F) were driving in my car to a concert. The concert details mentioned valet parking across the street from the venue, so we settled on parking there. 

2 miles from the venue, I noticed on the map that the hotel with the valet service was on the left side of the road and assumed that we needed to be in the furthest left lane of the one-way road that we were driving down. I told Steve that it would be a good idea to go ahead and merge in advance. Steve said not to worry, that he would get into the left lane when he needed to, and stayed in the middle lane.

Once we were half a mile from the venue, I saw a public parking garage on our left. I thought the garage may be a cheaper and easier option, so in a split second decision, I told Steve to go into the garage. Without looking behind him, Steve turned into the left lane, and we were hit by an oncoming car. My car was towed, and we ended up walking the last half mile to the concert. I paid for the 40 minute Uber home.

The car didn’t look good. It was hit in the front left corner and the tire was broken. I’ve accepted that the car is likely totaled. I called Steve the next night. I believe that, since he was driving, he should pay half of my $1,000 deductible. I also asked him to pay 50% of car payments on the used car I end up buying, up to the value of my old car. He refused, saying that he needs to think about what is best for him financially. He said I didn’t care about him because I was trying to put him in a tough spot. He said he can’t and won’t help me pay for another car.

I am a full-time college student graduating this year. I have a part-time job that pays $9/hour and some money saved up for emergencies. Steve just started a full-time job making $17/hour and is living rent-free with a friend. He drives an older car (given to him by his parents) with 150k miles on it because his car gave out recently (that car was a replacement for his previous car, which he also wrecked).

After our conversation, I thought for a while and realized I don’t want to spend my life with someone so selfish. I called him back to break things off. He was staying at his parents’ house for the night since his job site is in the area, and after a few minutes of me telling him that we were over and why I was breaking things off, I heard his dad’s voice on the other end.

His dad tore into me, saying that my insurance payout should be enough to get a replacement car. I said I was asking for help to get a reliable vehicle that was comparable to what I had, and he refused on behalf of his son, saying “that’s life” and that Steve has things of his own that he needs to save for. At the end of the call, he said that if I was serious about asking this from his son, I would be doing him a favor by leaving him. He said I woke up everyone in the house and hung up on me. I spent the rest of the night sobbing. AITA for asking my fiancé for money when he wrecked my car?

,AmItheAsshole,"I (23m) Live with my parents. I stay in the basement that was converted to an apartment for grandma (since passed) when I was very young. I work full time and buy my own stuff. However, we do share food and I eat with them at dinner. I will occasionally buy myself a bottle of crown royal and will occasionally have a small glass. I don’t drink often but when I do I like to drink crown. The last two bottles I bought were the Vanilla and the peach flavored ones. The Peach one currently only has a shots worth left in it, but the only time I had some of it was a shot I had when I first bought it a month ago. The vanilla is completely gone and I only had one small glass of it. The peach was the small sized bottle and the vanilla was a bigger bottle. I said something to my dad about it and how I was going to stop buy them cus I don’t get much of it and it’s a lot of money for me to spend and not get very much of it. He took it well and said he’d start asking more before taking a shot. He even went out  and replaced the bottle he drank which I greatly appreciated. This was two weeks ago. Since then I had not yet opened that bottle. A few minutes ago I went to fix me some water and when I went into the freezer to get some ice I noticed that the new bottle was opened. I asked my mom first (she was the first one I saw after) if she’d been in it and she said she had a shot yesterday. I followed up and said okay that was fine and explained that I just noticed it when I was in the freezer and was curious as I had not had any of that bottle yet. She then got a bit of an attitude and said “well your dad bought it, but I won’t do it again”. I told her that he bought to replace the bottle they drank and she just repeated “I won’t do it again” in an annoyed tone. 

Am I the asshole for saying anything about it? I didn’t say it in an angry or even annoyed way, I was just curious when i asked her. 


Edit: I should have mentioned that both my parents said they were going to start getting their own whiskey to keep in their freezer to have so they wouldn’t drink up mine. This was after one of the first times I casually brought up them drinking mine. I should also preface I’m not mad about them drinking it. I just did not feel that my mom snapping at me saying “I won’t do it again” was warranted when I asked her if she had been it the newest bottle. 

Edit 2: I am getting questions about how much I pay in rent to my parents. Short answer is I don’t. But we have an agreement that I pay for my car (that I bought and is in my name), my part of our auto insurance, and my part of our phone bill. I know it’s not the same as paying rent, but they have said they don’t want to charge me rent. I do realize I this post makes me sound a little entitled or spoiled. But again, I’m not actually upset about the drinking my whiskey as I am aware it’s only fair as I get to eat food and what not they pay for.

,AmItheAsshole,"So I (25F) have a brother (32M) who for the last ten years has lived across the country. I've seen him every so often, but neither of us has a lot of money so there weren't a lot of big trips to visit each other. He recently moved back to the area (but still about 5 hours away). I told him about a month ago that I'd have time the last weekend of October to visit him and his family (he has two kids, 3M and 5F and a wife). He said they'd just moved in and didn't have any furniture yet or anything but could accommodate. 

At the same time, a group of my friends from high school were trying to make plans to get together. A lot of us haven't seen each other in awhile and we've never all gotten together since graduation. Multiple dates were thrown out and for one reason or another everyone said they weren't free to do anything on any date except the last Sunday in October. So I said sure. I reached out to my brother and told him I could either come down for a day in October or figure out another day when I could come for the entire weekend. He said he'd still be down for me coming that weekend and could come for another longer weekend another time.

Then my friends changed the plans and made the reunion for Saturday instead. My brother reached out to me asking if I was still coming, and so I told my brother never mind, we'd have to figure out another date because I really can't do everything that weekend.

I ended up seeing my friends, but my brother stopped answering my text after I explained to him that I couldn't go, and when I finally got him to answer me today he said he was upset.

My brother is annoyed with me now and saying that he had made the plans with me first to come visit and it was inconsiderate of me to cancel for friends and I should have just told my friends in the first place that I wasn't available that weekend because I was coming to visit him. I feel really bad about it but I had been thinking I almost never see these friends and I know I'll find another weekend to visit him, but I can't figure out if he's right and I shouldn't have gone at all.

,AmItheAsshole,"So my mom is a hoarder and I don’t know what to do.I’m going to try and keep this as short and simple as possible.

My parents are divorced so me and my sister live with our mom. Up until 2020 we rented a spacious  3 bedroom apartment but due to financial struggles we had to move into my dad’s apartment. To clarify, my dad owns this apartment but does not reside in it as he lives outside of the country.

This apartment is a quite smaller 2 bedroom apartment. The arrangement we made was that I got the primary bedroom, my sister the second room and my mom sleeps on the couch. My room has two walls covered with closets. I only have the one for my clothes as the others are linen closets and my mom’s closets.

The main problem is that the apartment is too stuffed. Up until recently I had my mom’s stationary bike in my room which I did not like. The entry is stacked with my mom’s  two bookcases which reach the ceiling and look quite bad. There is also a drawers for my mom and an old ikea entryway furniture where we put random stuff. There is a third bookcase in the kitchen as it was the only space available.

After moving back in I wanted to fix my room and make it feel more like my own as a teenager does. But the house also looks bad and whenever I propose things to my mother she quickly turns them down. For example I told her to throw out the stationary bike as we have it in the balcony, looks ugly and she doesn’t even use it. I also suggested she rent a little storage room to store her books so that we open up the space and put nicer furniture ,potentially a closet for her, which she both refused. I am also quite frustrated that she has to go into my room everyday to get her clothes.

I know that it is a difficult situation that she also is affected by but any home improvements she rejects. Whenever I tell her to throw away anything she immediately it turns down because “it was expensive” or “it was a gift” when she hasn’t even used it in the past 10 years.

My dad gave me this old suitcase that I decided to throw out as we don’t need it/don’t have the space to store it but my mom insists on keeping it. I think I’m going to throw it out and initiate a conversation with her as to what to do with all the stuff.

&lt;p&gt;I know that it is a difficult situation that she also is affected by but any home improvements she rejects. Whenever I tell her to throw away anything she immediately it turns down because “it was expensive” or “it was a gift” when she hasn’t even used it in the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad gave me this old suitcase that I decided to throw out as we don’t need it/don’t have the space to store it but my mom insists on keeping it. I think I’m going to throw it out and initiate a conversation with her as to what to do with all the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any advice on what to do please comment below I really need someone’s opinion, thank you for reading.(Sorry for misguided title)&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"So I (16M) went to my stepmum's (49F) place a bit ago.

Before I start the story, I have ASD (autism spectrum disorder) and I'm also a child of a divorced household and have pretty severe PTSD in relation to arguing in general. Especially involving my Dad (47M).

While I was there, my stepmum had spent all day trying to make her place as comfortable as possible for me, which I really appreciated.

I felt tensions rise between her and my dad during dinner when they had a mild disagreement about a house they planned to buy together.

I had dinner then immediately when we sat down to watch a movie, they began arguing.

I panicked and left the room, calling my friend and speaking to her. I very quickly heard them go from angry speaking to yelling and cussing eachother out.

I asked my friend if she was around to spend the night at my place, to which she said yes.

I went downstairs and interrupted their argument tearfully to say I couldn't be there anymore, that I was overstimulated, panicking and just wanted to be at home.

I told them my friend was going to come over so I wouldn't be alone, and that all I needed was to get a cab back.

Then suddenly they both started begging me to stay. 

Long story short, I left.

My stepmum then didn't speak to me for 3 whole weeks, then when I saw her again this weekend, she read me a letter essentially telling me how selfish I was for this.

She detailed how she felt like her conversations with my dad were being policed based on what I wanted and that everything needed to be about me because I'm autistic.

I understand that sometimes plans have to change around me because of my disorders, but this all felt like a little too much in my opinion.

I'm not sure if I'm not taking into account how she feels, I know that I tend to struggle with empathy so I'm sure I missed a social cue or am just pain misunderstanding what's so hurtful about me expressing a desire to leave in a tense situation?

TL:DR, I left her house because I was uncomfortable with the arguing and she found it rude that I left

Basically, I treated my girlfriend kind of poorly throughout our relationship in the sense that I withheld information from her pertaining to our sex life.

I wasn't very respectful to the sister, I'll admit, but she basically gave me no benefit of the doubt and immediately got hateful with me.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (F22) bought two pairs of kitchen shears. We've owned the old ones in our kitchen for years and they are so dull that it can't even cut a thin plastic bag. I thought I was doing a good thing.

Later that day, I get a text from my sister asking the whereabouts of the scissors. I explain that I tossed them because they literally aren't useful anymore. She then says her mom is not very happy with my actions and told me to consult with them next time. I then apologize while explaining my reasoning. I also tell her that if they didn't take out the trash, fortunately the scissors would be there.

Furthermore, I add the conversation we had about a few weeks ago pertaining to the dull knives we own. A year ago, my younger sister accidentally bought a second knife from a famous YouTuber and asked if I wanted it. Of course I took it. But guess who uses my knife? Her and her mom. 

I just got a text saying that apparently, her mom sharpens the scissors and they are hers. While I do understand that they are ""hers"" (they're actually my Dad's before they moved in), I disagree with the supposed sharpening. I legit used the scissors the other day and couldn't open a frozen bag of chicken which is pitiable.

We&amp;#39;ve owned the old ones in our kitchen for years and they are so dull that it can&amp;#39;t even cut a thin plastic bag. I thought I was doing a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that day, I get a text from my sister asking the whereabouts of the scissors. I explain that I tossed them because they literally aren&amp;#39;t useful anymore. She then says her mom is not very happy with my actions and told me to consult with them next time. I then apologize while explaining my reasoning. I also tell her that if they didn&amp;#39;t take out the trash, fortunately the scissors would be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I add the conversation we had about a few weeks ago pertaining to the dull knives we own. A year ago, my younger sister accidentally bought a second knife from a famous YouTuber and asked if I wanted it. Of course I took it. But guess who uses my knife? Her and her mom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just got a text saying that apparently, her mom sharpens the scissors and they are hers. While I do understand that they are &amp;quot;hers&amp;quot; (they&amp;#39;re actually my Dad&amp;#39;s before they moved in), I disagree with the supposed sharpening. I legit used the scissors the other day and couldn&amp;#39;t open a frozen bag of chicken which is pitiable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, she didn&amp;#39;t comment on the dull knives in the house. I&amp;#39;m also not at home and am about to drive back. Totally, totally excited to confront them about it. But more importantly, I&amp;#39;m gonna take back my knife and hide it. I actually do this on the daily so they don&amp;#39;t use it. &lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"Okay for the context. My brother keeps bringing his girlfriend in the house everyweek for 3 days. This means usually from Friday to Sunday and my dayoff is Saturday and Sunday. My brother's girlfriend, just sleep, scroll on her phone and just eat in our house. While I clean, cook and wash dishes, even washing my brother's girlfriend empty plates. 

Honestly, I'm uncomfortable with having someone around especially a stranger and my brother's girlfriend is still a stranger for me. The house is just small, owned by my deceased mother, just enough for 3 people and we don't have any rooms. My and my brother's bed is basically just a bunk bed so we don't have any privacy. I can't relax in the house because of the stranger's presence. Though I'd say i don't have huge problem with the girl's attitude just that her constant presence really bugs me off, I can't move in the house freely where I'm supposed to because there's this visitor. 

Now I told my father about this and he just keeps saying, he'll talk to them but in the end nothing changed. I just found out that father gave my brother a permission to bring the girl every week as long just just for 1 day and not 3 days. I'm basically a maid in the house even when I'm the daughter. But I feel like they love the girlfriend more than their own family.

Anyway, long story short, I fought with my dad about it, because all I want is for the girlfriend to visit the house once or twice a month since we have no privacy, but my dad said that my brother is in settlement age, means ready to have family, and said I should suck it up because my brother needs his own family own, also telling me I'm selfish that I only think for myself because I want to solo the house, which is not true.. I'm just frustrated because, the house, the home I've grown up to now feels like I don't belong anymore.. All I want is a moment of peace where I could enjoy my dayoff.. But instead I become a maid and unable to do what I want because the house is just small. Now, I decided to leave the house without any plan haha.. Straying here and there for 4 days now and just go to work so I could keep supporting myself for necessities like food.

So, the gist of this whole situation is that today one of my friends through Steam posted in a GC about an artwork he finally finished. Because he's never really mentioned it before nor claimed to have any artistic talent, I was immediately skeptical. I do feel kind of bad for immediately assuming it was copied or anything of the sort, but I ended up reverse image searching the image he sent and saw a reddit post with the same image from 6 months ago. It was from r/wallpaper and it was an AI artwork (That's why artwork is in quotes in the title), and the more I compared the two, the more it seems he just took the original image and cropped it. I did end up asking him about it, and our this was the conversation (copy pasted directly from Steam)

Friend:

    yes, i seen that before i liked it, but it was AI generated so i recreated it so i could acualy use it, probobly not worth the 400 hours of coding for color corection but it wasnt really a i made it its more of a i recreated it maticulasly
    
    i also dont even know hot do just get a wallpaper to work for a screen shot ar anything so yea, they are alwys super blurry idk why

Me:

    looking over the pictures side by side, you can easily notice many details in the exact same style and at the exact same position with the exact same colors. unless you literally traced it perfectly and used an eyedropper tool to make this, then...

\[3:49 PM\]

Friend:

    like i said, i used code, i cant draw for shit, but i know how to code, its as simple as checking the file code are remaking it, (i really wish i could have just copy and pasted) but you can also see you version is much smaller, thats cuz i waz lazy and didnt want to fully finish it
    
    i ment to say my version is smaller

Me:

    ok, sure, I sort of accept that, but they way you worded your message in the gc claims originality over the piece. that's where most of my confusion comes from. that paired with the fact that it looks like you just downloaded and cropped the image is why my thought process led me down the path that it did

    thats fair, i get it, i thougt of it as a it may not be a original but, it is still somthing i made, original or not, its still impresive

,AmItheAsshole,"WIBTA for not agreeing to walk their dogs everyday for 2 weeks and rejecting this ""offer""?
We all have full time jobs

Backstory: I was informed last night my father and his gf will be going on another vacation soon, so the dogs will need to be walked, etc (dogs aged 2 &amp; 1). this tension began when they got their first dog 2 years ago and my bf and I ended up doing a lot to make sure their puppy wasn't stuck in a kennel all day, with their feces, while they worked. it's obviously tricky to get weeks/months off manage the puppy phase, but we also have full time jobs. Most days, my bf and I leave the house after them and most times one of us would be home prior to them (due to their commute). This in turn lead us to being the ones to deal with whatever the dog (and now dogs) have left during the day. We ended up stopping after the 2nd dog puppy phase repeated itself. I even spoke to them and explained prior that I do not want to help in naming or picking out your dog so I have no attachments and that these dogs are yours as a couple, just because we live around them does not mean they are our dogs too. They got very offended by this but I was trying to warr them that we will no longer be subjecting ourselves and our time to clean up and take care of their dogs.

They realized a lot recently since we stopped picking up
after their 2nd puppy. We overheard them angrily cleaning up, and they mentioned ""i think we are cleaning up more now since (me &amp; bf) were cleaning it up before"". We couldnt help but feel guilty leaving messes like that but we felt it was the only way to finally have them stop depending on us. We give them a heads up now and clean up occasionally. They just are not appreciative, but I do not beleive this is something to be expected of when a couple goes out together to get dogs

Current Situation: when i was informed of this upcoming vacation, they decided to throw money values in; no rent from either of us for the month. It's a pretty decent deal. We would have to walk them everyday, feed, let outside (one is stillin a crate all day since neither are trained &amp; have very sensitive stomachs for big dogs), and etc. They paid for a dog walker the last one of 5 trips (this would be cheaper than us not paying). My bf and I do not want to agree to this. We understand it's convenient for them, and maybe it's not all that bad. Regardless, we feel wronged and that we cannot escape this unless we move out (we are actively looking and saving, ive had medical issues
that prevented me from working and driving so i started from scratch again last year). I feel we should be able to say no, we basically dont want to walk them everyday for 2 weeks in Decemeber (Canada decemeber).

,AmItheAsshole,"I work at a company that has given me a lot of headaches since I started. They’ve tried to diminish me/my work, swept an abusive boss’ actions under the rug, and made sure they pay me (and everyone else) as little as possible. 

The only reason I’ve stayed is because I love the colleagues I have in other departments. One of those colleagues is my mentor and over the past few years both she and I have been open with each other about interviewing elsewhere. She doesn’t have the ability to promote me or fire me, but she’s kept my words confidential, and I’ve kept hers confidential as well.

Thankfully, in the past year, there has been a CIO who took pity on us and fought for improvements. I finally got the promotion I deserved and was able to hire the staff we needed. 

Unfortunately they lowballed me on the offer - giving me an increase based on what I was making instead of market rate for the position. I warned them that recruiters from competitors reach out to me with opportunities all of the time. They threw in a measly $10k, keeping me about $30k below market. 

Despite that, my life improved overall. Work/life balance has gotten reasonable. I work from home. I live in a low cost of living area so the debt/income ratio has been ok even on a single income. 

Now the inevitable is happening. Our #1 competitor is hiring for a role that would fit me perfectly, and I have extensive experience with their products. They have not listed this role publicly but their recruiter has reached out to me. I said I’d be willing to have a conversation and let them share my CV. 

I’m torn on whether to tell my mentor or not. On the one hand, I know she feels underpaid &amp; is willing to leave for money; so she would hopefully understand. This opportunity would pay me as much as 3 promotions at my current job. Plus I feel like my promotion was forced on my boss and idk when I’ll be able to move up again. 

On the other hand, I don’t know if my mentor will feel I should be satisfied the promotion I just got. I don’t know if she’ll see this opportunity as a betrayal, because it’s a direct competitor. 

I know my mentor and the new hiring manager will be on an industry panel together later this week, so there’s a risk she’ll learn it from them. Should I tell her myself?

,AmItheAsshole,"Me (M21) and my friends (all M around the same age) went to a Halloween party together last week. When we arrived, we started taking some drinks. I know my limits when it comes to alcohol, but I've drank a little more than usual, which resulted on me having to take a break for a while to recover myself. I told my friends I was going on the second floor to have a sit and I'd be back soon. When I got there, I was slowly losing my mind and passed out at the seat. I was unconscious for 3 whole hours (I know it was unresponsible of me to drink so much, but in my defense, there was other parties that I've drank more, and didn't got that bad [my friend that vanished thinks that as well, cuz he also didn't drank much passed out too. He thinks someone put something at our drinks]).

When I woke up, the party was already at the end and I took my phone to see what happened. 4 missed calls of my friends and a lot of messages. I called them back and told them what happened and asked where was they. They said they tried to find me and other friend of us (they thought we were kissing somewhere cause we vanished by the same time), and they were now 3 miles away, walking to the bus station to go home. I was so confused, and asked what about the other friend, and they didn't knew. I had almost no battery and had to run those 3 miles to find them, 5AM during rain, with only a t-shirt and shorts (it was cold asf). If I didn't, my phone would die and I would not get home, cuz I didn't knew where I was (the party was at another city). When I found them, I screamed all my thought about how unresponsible and idiots they were letting me behind unconscious. Now they think I'm overthinking it and it's not a big deal. I'm really pissed off because what they did, not entirely because they left me, but cause they left my friend too (we all knew he's phone had no battery and he had no money. I convinced they to get back to the party's place to try finding him. It took hours to find him and eventually we went to the police station to communicate his vanish). We later found him and he was fine, bit if I didn't asked about him, they wouldn't go after. Am I really overthinking it and being narcissist to think they should care more about a friend's safety at a party?
AITA?


UPDATE: Reading the comments I realized I missed some details:

- The party was NOT AT A HOUSE, it was at a place used for shows. The party's organization released yesterday that around 2000 people was there that night. That's why they say they could not find me (6 friends in total) and that's why this situation pissed me off, because there was SO many people there, anything could've happened (first time posting so here's a question: can I post videos? I have one that shows how much people was there). Although it was full of people, there was ONLY ONE place that had chairs. If I wanted to have a seat, there wasn't other place to go.

But nonetheless we’ll get to what happened just a few minutes ago, what the title is about.

For dinner my parents made chicken and fries, I wasn’t looking forward to it so I made my own quick meal, which was a banana shake. I was in the kitchen with my mom and sister(14F), and I’ll specify that my sister knew I was making the shake. She sits down, goes on her phone, and ignores us, but she knows what I’m making. 

After I finished making it, I’m drinking what is obviously MY own dinner, but she sees me after I poured it into a cup and drank over half of the shake. She THEN decides to ask if she can have any, and I explained to her what’s in my cup is all that’s left, and that it’s my dinner. Instantly, she gets frustrated and tries getting me to pour some of it into a seperate cup for her. I explained, again, it’s my dinner, I need to eat, and she already had her own dinner. I would’ve been just fine with making extra for her if she would’ve asked, but she didn’t! How was I supposed to know she wanted any?

So then I go to my mom for some help, as standing against my sister on, really any conflict, feels like fighting a brick wall; she doesn’t budge from her opinion, and if she doesn’t get her way, she’s mad. My mom to my surprise to my sister side, saying something along the lines of “Well you should’ve asked her if she wanted any while you were making it!” So I have an upset sister who didn’t think ahead, and a mom who’s got her back.

I gave up and poured whatever was left of my shake into a separate cup for her. 

What I got from this was that I was in the wrong, because I didn’t ask my sister if she wanted any of the drink I was making for dinner. But the thing is, she was there and aware when I started making it! She’s 14, she easily could’ve asked. I don’t know why it’s my fault she failed to asked for soemthing that was being made right infront of her?

I don’t know if I’m being to stubborn, and I am aware at how small of an inconvenience this is, but it just hurts that little things like this happen so much.

,AmItheAsshole,"Mum,
I write this with love in my heart, and intend for this letter to outline my stance in terms of our relationship, including past dynamics, present dynamics, and how I wish our relationship to progress into the future, my boundaries and my grievances.
After speaking with a therapist, I have decided that this letter will be an act of healing in my own life, implementing boundaries within my relationship, offering you insight into my thoughts and feelings, and ultimately clearing my mind and heart of trauma that has deeply hurt me over 36 years of life.
This trauma has compounded over time, and I have always intended to deal with this, so the cyclical nature of trauma ends with me, and not with Rebecca . I feel this is my responsibility as a mum.
I sincerely hope you take the time to read this letter with an open mind.
1 think over the past year our relationship has reached its breaking point, | think this applies to other
relationships in your life, and I believe this letter will outline some concerns I have regarding our relationship and your self destructive behaviours that I worry will further isolate you.
I want to make this letter, as clear as possible and offer evidence, so it's clear why I've made the conclusion I've made.
Your way of communicating with me:
I know there has been much conversation about your behaviour at Christmas, between yourself, and other family members. I want to make it clear what was said and how this impacted mine and rebeccas Christmas.
After returning home from the hippodrome in great festive spirits. That evening the conversation went as follows:
You said 'John got an ear infection' I said 'it's probably not an infection'
You said 'you really are thick as fuck aren't you, no wonder you have no friends'
Now I can't comprehend why a mother would say this to their daughter, especially when your granddaughter was in the flat and heard the conversation.
I know you have told Jane that you 'honestly can't remember saying that',
However, I'm not convinced by this standpoint you re making. I think saying 'you can't remember' is an excuse to hide from responsibility, avoid judgement from family members, and dissolve yourself from taking accountability.
And if in all honesty, you can't remember saying that, then that is a major concern, and something ! would urge you speak to a professional about. Perhaps you have bouts of rage that you're unable to control and this is a symptom of a bigger problem, such as an issue with your mental health - I will elaborate on this later in the letter.
On this Christmas you also offered judgement onto John. I will paraphrase what was said by yourself:",t2_7wv2u4sm,False,,0,False,"AITA for sending this letter to my narcissistic mother, she’s read the first page and said it’s pure ‘venom’. AITA?

,AmItheAsshole,"This past weekend my husband 27m and I 27f threw a party. Toward the end of the night we were all extremely intoxicated and there were only about 6 of us left over, but only one of them is really important to the story. We’ll call her M.
(I am using the video M recorded to recount the evening as I was very drunk and do not remember most of the night.)
 M was recording on my phone all of us dancing and hanging out in the garage and M came over to me and while recording and tried to kiss me and I moved away, she attempted a second time and I once again moved away, she attempted a third time and we ended up kissing( it was the type of drunk pecs girls give to their friends that I’m pretty sure every single girl has done) and I immediately walked away to stand with my husband. The next morning I have completely forgotten about the incident and my husband decides he wants to watch all of the videos from the night before, as we were scrolling through we came across the video and my memory instantly came back and I told him I didn’t want to watch the video because it was embarrassing, I ended up deleting the video (I know, bad choice) my husband asked me if I deleted it, at first I said no but then came clean as to what I believed to be on the video. I told him that I deleted it because I was embarrassed and panicked, he ended up going outside and ultimately ended up leaving. When I noticed he was gone I called to see where he went and he said he went for a drive and was talking to his sister, I told him he should come back so we can talk about the situation and he agreed. Here’s where I think I went wrong, we agreed that prior to this we incident we had never set the boundary of me kissing other girls (which I haven’t done since we have been together) but he asked me how I would label it and I told him that to me any action you feel the need to hide from your S.O is considered cheating. I would like to preface that he has also kissed a few of the his fellow military friends and did not tell me for months until it came up in random conversation. 
Since this, he refuses to talk to me, and told me he needs to “think about us”, when I told him that that sentence scared me he told me it’s not his job to comfort me and he hopes I feel bad and that I need to think about what I did. He has been extremely cold and as much as I have tried to taken responsibility and deal with the repercussions he has constantly made me feel like garbage about a situation that I don’t remember.

,AmItheAsshole,"So my (37m) ex-wife (35f) have been divorced for six years and have two kids together under 10. The divorce was not unusual but a pattern emerged during that time where it seemed like my ex would try to intrude into my business whenever possible. Her boundaries are not good, or rather, her willingness to respect my boundaries. Some limited examples include: I kept the home, but even after moving across the city she felt entitled to enter my home whenever she wanted, she created fake social media accounts to try and keep tabs on me, and freaked out on me several times when I started dating, despite being in a relationship with her affair partner. As a result, I decided to do everything I could to avoid any crossover in our lives other than the children. I stopped talking to mutual friends, and built my own network of friends that she doesn’t know. It’s been great for my mental health. Many of my friends live in my neighborhood but my ex didn’t know them when she lived here. She has interacted with them briefly at school events because my kids are friends with their kids as well. When my friends have asked about her, I keep the information limited, and not share the extent to which she made my life difficult during our marriage. 

So, recently my ex took my oldest to a birthday party for one of my friends’ kids. Apparently during that party the moms were talking about our Halloween party coming up around my ex. I don’t have my kids this year but I go every year. According to my ex, she was invited to bring the kids, and according to my friends, she invited herself via text after the birthday party. The truth is probably somewhere in between. Nonetheless, two of the wives told me about it the next time I saw them, literally hours after seeing my ex at an event for our kids. They were apologetic and said they weren’t sure how it happened and were asking if I was okay with that. I told them that I need her to not be there and that I’d offer to have the kids and bring them to the party if she wanted. My friends were understanding and said they’d support me however I needed. I told them I’d make it about me, not them. Not surprisingly, my ex didn’t go for it and was insistent that she was going. This led to a contentious back and forth where she accused me of trying to control her, demanding that if I wanted her to not come I needed to call her (where she usually tries to steamroll me), and claiming that I was violating her boundaries by talking about her with my friends. She’s also insistent that she’s allowed to be friends with anyone she wants, and I can’t stop her from being friend with these people.

I finally ended it by telling her that she had been uninvited and I was the one communicating it on behalf of my friends. She then told my kids that I uninvited her from the party and they were mad at me for a few days.

,AmItheAsshole,"Hi all! Throwaway account.

I (20F) just started an English class at my school. We started about a month ago, and about a week into the semester we got an email from the professor.

The email was titled “Books, Attendance, and Bananas!”. Curiously, I clicked the email and read.

The email had a section titled Books, and one titled Attendance, and one titled Bananas.

The Bananas section said: “We have a student in our class who has a very severe allergy to bananas. Please do not bring one with you into our classroom.”

Immediately I burst out in laughter, I’d never heard of someone being THAT allergic to bananas. Like seriously, you can’t even be around them in such a big room? Will you explode? I don’t even like bananas (who does tbh?) so I wasn’t gonna bring one in, but it still made me cackle.

The next day I went to class and before we started I showed some of my classmates the email and I started laughing uncontrollably. They looked at me and were confused as to why I thought it was that funny. I explained that it was such a ridiculous allergy to have, like who is allergic to bananas? They all didn’t seem to think it was that funny.

Then some girl behind us said she was the one who was allergic to bananas, and she was “a little offended” that I was laughing so much at her allergies. The room got awkward after that.

The way the email was titled, and the way it was worded was too funny. I mean surely someone can understand, it had “bananas!” with an exclamation point.

It’s been almost a month and still when I walk into the class I can’t help but wanna burst out laughing, but also feel maybe I shouldn’t think it’s so funny, as the room is a little tense and people don’t seem to want to be my friend.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (22M) live in NYC with my twin sister (22F). My dad’s friend had a rent-stabilized apartment that had been vacant for a while because it was in pretty bad shape. To make it livable, my dad generously spent a lot of money (in the tens of thousands) to renovate it, so my sister and I could move in as roommates.

When we agreed to move in, I was the only one with a job, so I took the larger bedroom and agreed to cover 70% of the rent ($750), while she'd pay 30%. Honestly, the bigger room isn’t worth more than double rent, but I really wanted it and she was in a tough spot, so I agreed to it.

I moved in last month, but she didn’t. She’s still living about ten minutes away at my parents' place, and I think she's just procrastinating on the actual move. For the first month, she had just started her job, so my dad covered her portion of the rent.

Now that month two is coming up, she’s refusing to pay her share because she says she still hasn’t moved in. I feel like she should still pay since she signed the lease, has her own room here, and could move in any time. I even offered a compromise where she could delay paying rent until she actually moves in, and then pay back what she owes (all the months she misses and the month she moves in). I thought that was more than fair, but she called me selfish, saying that since I have the apartment to myself, I should pay all the rent.

I told her she has three options: either start paying her part of the rent now, pay me all the back rent she owes when she decides to move in, or stay at our parents' place permanently and I’ll cover the full rent, but in that case, she can’t just move in whenever she wants. Now, my parents are fully (like screaming at me a ton) taking her side, saying I should only make her pay rent when she decides to actually move in. I think they just want her out of their place, but it's not my responsibility. She has a job now that pays like 68k/year (my guess based on what my mom has said) and her rent is literally less than $350/month. 

I’m just starting my first job post-college, and I’d rather not be covering 25% of my income on rent when I should only be paying about 18%. AITA for wanting her to take responsibility for her portion?

I (40yf) am engaged to the love of my life (38ym). We have been together for almost 3 years and got engaged on our second anniversary. We are about 4 months out from our wedding.

And I thought it would be nice if his father did a short blessing before we ate. Both me and my fiancé are extremely atheist. We both were raised in very Christian households.

Our non religious friends can just “zone out” for two minutes… My fiancé was mad that I was “planning” this blessing to happen without asking him. I had not asked his father to do it yet, it was more of an idea for how to include him. We are working through it….

,AmItheAsshole,"My late husband and I have 3 kids, Elena (16), Lucas (15), and Elizabeth (10). My husband passed 4 years ago and had a large enough life insurance policy that I was able to pay off the house and had enough left over to nearly triple the kids college funds. There is enough money in each of their accounts for them to go to a public university debt free or at least 2 years in a private university without scholarships or financial aid. 

Elena has always had mental health/behavioral issues. She’s been in therapy since she was 4 and until last year was attending an alternative school. Over the summer, she stole her dad’s car and crashed it after I said she couldn’t go on vacation with her friend.

They were so upset that I took this all out of Elena’s account.

,AmItheAsshole,"Hey everyone, never really posted on here but have had this eating at me for months at this point. So context myself (M26) and my wonderful fiancé (F25) are getting married next summer in her hometown. We’re both genuinely very excited but have run into a ton of struggle over the guest list. We both come from similar families where the mom is siblings with 5 or 6 others who all have families of their own, and the dads come from much smaller families.

That being said, we’ve sort of ended up being strong armed into a larger wedding (200 plus people) by nature of how large our immediate families are. Add in family friends on both sides and we’re easily looking at a guest list north of 200. For a long time though, my parents personally have been pushing very hard for me to invite my dad’s cousins and their families. For context I’ve already included his immediate family, cousins, and college friends and a couple of their families (20 additional people) already, but these are people who my fiancé and I genuinely enjoy.

The issue I’ve struggled with here is that my dad’s cousins are a mess and I’ve only seen them once in the past 7 or 8 years. We all used to see each other every year but long story short there was an ugly falling out in that family and now we only really see a few people in that group on a regular basis anymore.  It was very painful for me as I was a teenager when it happened and personally struggle with the idea of inviting people who stopped wanting to know me to my wedding day. Additionally, my finance’s mom also wanted to invite cousins but accepted my fiancé’s answer when she said no due to the size of the guests and that she didn’t know them super well.

I’ve gone back and forth on the issue for months but In an attempt to sort of appease everyone I recently told my parents that we would be inviting only a few of his cousins (who we actually know to some extent or have seen in recent years) and that we weren’t inviting the others as I haven’t known them since I was a kid. Essentially my dad blew up at me, basically asking how I could put him in such an awkward position given the nature of his family and how they will blame him for me not inviting them. I tried explaining that it’s me making the call and if he needed to he could blame me, but still he remained incredibly upset, and just hung up on me mid conversation.

I’m very upset that a group of people that I’ve only seen once in almost a decade are causing this much of a rift between us and my parents.

,AmItheAsshole,"I, 42F, was at the state capitol and needed to use the restroom.

The women’s restroom is very nice, with free pads and tampons available, B&amp;BW soaps and soft paper towels. Inside/adjacent to the restroom there is a lactation room. I took a peek.

There was a chair and a small side table and a bookshelf. On top of the bookshelf there were baby wipes, Clorox wipes, and various sanitizing wet wipes. There was a pan and broom inside, and the rest of the bookshelf was full of almost-emptied rolls of toilet paper.

On the side table there was a booklet about legislative priorities. Curious, I sat down to flip through it. I heard a knock and a man said “Anybody in here?” which I didn’t respond to for a few reasons:

1. It was impossible to tell where this was coming from.
2. It was impossible to tell why they wanted to know if anyone was in wherever it was they were knocking.
3. I was in a room where a woman has a reasonable expectation of unbothered privacy, so I didn’t think it was important.

The person knocking was a male janitor; I heard him moving throughout the bathroom. It only took him a minute or so, and then it was quiet again for a moment when BAM! He barged around the corner. Both of us were startled. He backed away from the doorway for a beat, then left. This happened so fast it was impossible for him to have seen anything. A minute later he shouted:

“Ma’am, I’m gonna have to ask you to leave.”

When I walked out into the hallway I asked, very politely, why I was being asked to leave. He said, in a very aggravated tone:

“Because that’s my work space.”

I asked if it was just so he could clean the bathroom. He replied, more agitated now:

“You’re in my way!!”

I said I wasn’t being rude and was simply asking why I was being asked to leave. He reiterated, now posturing as though he needed to look tough:

“I’m not being rude, either. You’re in my way, you have to leave!!”

I “clutched my pearls” and turned and walked to the elevator and once again said he didn’t have to be so rude.

On my way out I stopped at the cafe to grab a drink. A man walked up to me and told me that he was security and that staff on the second floor asked for me to be escorted out of the building. I told him I was on my way out, but he continued to berate me:

“The bathroom is everything on the left!! That is not a room for you to just sit in and charge your phone. You don’t even have any kids!!”

I said I wasn’t charging my phone, and asked how he knew I didn’t have any kids. He looked at me, dumbfounded, and said:

“They aren’t *with* you. You don’t have any kids with you. To use that room you need to be breastfeeding a child.”

He then continued to say that they “had had problems in the past”. I walked out of the elevator and headed to work.

FWIW, there is a public access room on the fourth floor that is open year-round with Wi-Fi and outlets to charge devices.

,AmItheAsshole,"So long story short, 
I’ve been dating my bf for about 10 months now. He moved in around 6 months because he was basically here every night. He has this super adorable cat that he eventually brought over from his moms. Cat and my dog are doing well coexisting and I really do love this cat, i got him a cat tree right in the living room next to my desk, I feed him breakfast and dinner most days, I buy him cat toys, I even gave up my whole spare bedroom for him because thats where he eats and that’s where his litter box is. 
But that’s where the problem comes in. I absolutely HATE the smell of the litter box. My boyfriend tries to clean it daily but often falls behind leaving my whole house smelling like a litter box. I have tried changing litter types but haven’t found a good one and my bf has got upset that I did this without talking to him about it first. I didn’t think litter type mattered that much but he is very protective of this cat and has anxiety around its health. 
The biggest problem of all though is that this cat is a male and was never fixed. We think he is around 5 years old based on when my bf got him and this cat was essentially a street cat before he took him in. The cat sprays and “marks his territory” in several spots in my house and it makes me very upset. It is frankly disgusting and the smell is so strong and hard to get out of things. This cat has sprayed on things from my furniture, power strips, my fucking air fryer, can’t leave shoes on the ground, it is very frustrating. When my bf first moved the cat in we agreed we would get him fixed in hopes of it cutting down on the spraying. Now he is going back on his word and is saying the cat is “too old” to get fixed and is worried something will go wrong in surgery or that he won’t have the same personality after. And he refuses to let the cat out because he fights other cats and he’s worried it will get hit by a car(even though it survied it’s kitten days as a stray on a very busy road). I am at my witts end here. I love animals and really do love this cat but I really dont think I can be happy the next 10-15 years if my house keeps smelling like a giant cat piss litter box. Am I the asshole here? I don’t see another solution besides ending the relationship if bf doesn’t want to get the cat fixed or make him an outdoor cat.

A time while we were at Torino (Italy) for summer vacation, i brought my squishmallow, there was my family and a friend of my dad with his daughter.

When i will bring my plush by someone, my dad EVERYTIME WHEN I TAKE ONE OF MY PLUSHIES, will mock me saying: ""When will you stop sleeping with plushies?"" In front of his friend, so, they laughed at me, and i felt really embarassed and really angry.

,AmItheAsshole,"First of all, I (17 F) know I'm probably a horrible person but I need an opinion from people that don't know me or my family.

Okay, some context : My parents separated last year when I was abroad to learn a new language. It was a whole year trip organised by my school. I was completely aware of that and knew it was for the best since they weren't in love and weren't happy together anymore. My father moved in another appartment. When I came back from my trip, my father told me he was now with another woman. They were together even before my father moved for another appartment, when I left to do my language trip. I learned that his new girlfriend live in the same building as my mother (cliché I know).

Okay onto the story. My father introduced me to his girlfriend and we spent a day together. All I knew after this day was that this was new to me and I needed time to get used to this situation. The days passed and some things I was uncomfortable with.

It's here I might be an asshole and I genuinely need advices/opinions 😅. Firstly she insists a lot to talk to me, spend time with me, etc. I don't have problems with her wanting to get to know me but she insists a lot. When we meet her, she would always come to me and ask me about my day, how I do in school, if I have problems (?), etc. I know it's not flagrant with text but she really insists a lot. Secondly, she already met my father's parents. Same, I don't have any problems with that, the thing is : my parents are not divorced yet. They are separated but not divorced. It's making me a bit uncomfortable but I don't know if that feeling is legitimate.
 
The event that made me write this post is an evening to a restaurant with my father, my father's parents and my father's girlfriend. I was very uncomfortable at this dinner and I didn't talk much (not that I talk much st family dinners anyway). When we were back home, my father told me that he ""didn't know he had such an impolite daughter"", that his girlfriend was trying to fit in this family and that I should be ashamed of my behavior. He also told me I was stupid for blaming the separation of him and my mother on his girlfriend. I never did nor say that once, even in thoughts. I don't even know this woman that much. I tried to explain to my father that I was simply uncomfortable with this situation for now but he said he didn't understand why and that there was nothing to be uncomfortable about.

Finally, I got another job, which was out of the way and was full time, which required my dad to do a lot of running around. Finally, at 21, I got my drivers license. I also did not have a credit score, so financing a car was not in the cards for me. Instead, my dad got himself a truck and I took over the payments on the car he already owned. Fast forward a year later and the car starts having problems which my dad knew about. I told him that it was making horrible sounds and wasn’t running well. One day on my way home from work it got so bad I was worried about breaking down. He said “hopefully you make it to work tomorrow” to which my friend that I worked with offered to pick me up that night so I could go to work with her in the morning.

,AmItheAsshole,"My older sister has a son, which is 19 and he lives with my sister. My sister got cheated on by her husband and he left her and her son. The house they were living in was her husband's so they're living with me(I live on my own) until they find a place.

 My sister always does all his work for him and he never appreciates it and instead yell at her for not doing enough. My sister's health was weaker after she gave birth and she also has anxiety(she would get slight panic attacks often). 

One day I was upstairs doing my work and my sister, who also has hypoglycemia, was mid passing out and her son was playing video games and ignoring her when he literally saw her collapsing. I rushed downstairs and gave a sweet to my sister. I told her son off, asking how he could not care about his own mother. He said that it was my sister's fault she was this weak.

,AmItheAsshole,"So I am looking for a balanced perspective on this. I know that I am at least partly in the wrong, but I don't know to what extent.

So my university friend (22F) and I (23F) went on holiday together. This friend is lovely but I sometimes feel that she tells me what to do. Of course, I'm not perfect either, so I overlook it.

We went to Ibiza for a week with two of her other friends whom I'd never met before. We did what everyone in Ibiza does, we partied every night; the tickets and the whole holiday were very expensive, with some being over £100. Both of us had never been to Ibiza before, and so we seized every opportunity to go and see all the clubs/events that we could.

We mostly had a good time there. There were bickers here and there, but nothing major. But on the last night, something happened. We went to ""Hi"" which is supposed to be the best club in the world. We were going home the next day. The tickets were expensive, and I felt that this would be probably the only time I would be able to get to see this club considering the cost of the holiday.

My friend said she wasn't enjoying the event so she wanted to go home. I felt I hadn't seen enough of it since we had only been there for a couple of hours (maybe 2?) My friend said that if I don't go home with her I'm selfish. I said that considering how every other night I had gone home with her and stayed out with her, I thought we should compromise. But she didn’t want to, and it turned into hurtful things being said. She started shouting at me. I raised my tone too and she told me not to take that tone with her. She called me selfish, I called her hypocritical. She said she was going home with or without me, and if I didn't come back with her she would never talk to me again because I would be choosing an event over our friendship. I didn't see it that way. I saw it as her getting angry that I wasn't doing what she says.

I said I was staying and she stormed off. The next day, she was very angry. We went on a walk and she said I'm selfish, ""not a girls' girl"", unkind, greedy, immature and should know better at 23, that she knows I'm in therapy but I need to work on myself for future friendships. She said that I've treated her horribly considering how caring of a friend she is. She said she's always had my back- she had to convince the friends she brought with her to give me a chance. As apparently they disliked me at first because I'm ""posh"" and ""shy"". She said she was ending our friendship.

She said that her friends and family think that I'm vile. On the plane ride back, she talked about me to a stranger next to me so I could hear it. I didn't know how to react so I said nothing.

I feel like I should have gone back with her, but I felt bossed around. Could I please have some insight into this situation? I want to learn and grow from this. And the fact that she's talking about me in such a negative light actually bothers me.

It turns out that a few months ago, I started to notice that some boxes were missing... I confronted my mother (f45) and she admitted that she was taking the medication in secret, because she believed that she also had ADHD. 

(Additional context: she doesn't believe in &gt;MY&lt; ADHD diagnosis, which was confirmed by very expensive neuropsychological tests, but she is completely convinced that SHE HAS ADHD based on the Facebook videos she watches. Oh... and she has had eating disorders since she was a teenager, which means she doesn't have a good relationship with her own body.) 

The thing is, she has never been to a psychiatrist in her life and she never goes when I schedule appointments for her. I firmly believe that she only takes it for the side effects: appetite suppression, euphoria and increased motivation. This is NOT good for her, especially since she has never cared about taking care of her own mental health, she doesn't even BELIEVE in the possibility of improvement through cognitive behavioral therapy. 

Anyway, let's get to the facts: I was furious when I found out that she had been taking the medication without any kind of medical guidance and I simply threw away ALL the boxes of Ritalin remaining. She got really mad at me, saying that she paid for it with ""her own"" money (my dad's money actually) and called me... well, an asshole.

Am I really? :/

,AmItheAsshole,"So early this afternoon I 19F was doing my nails and I noticed that my bf 22M who was sitting beside me hadn’t cut his toenails in ages, enough that they were poking over the ends of his toes and had that icky discolouration. I told him I wanted to cut his toe nails and asked him to put his foot on my lap. 

I cut all his toenails and filed them since they can be super scratchy in bed if I don’t and was down to the last pinky toe and I accidentally cut a little too low. He said ouch and I apologised and went to finish cutting the nail off, but he kept jerking his foot so when I went to clip down I accidentally cut too low again. 

It wasn’t enough to draw blood or anything but he started cradling his foot and closely inspecting the toe. I apologised and said I didn’t mean too and it was an accident because he was jerking his foot. I then asked if I could just file it so it wouldn’t scratch me later, to which he got super mad at me.

He kept going on about how it’s his body and such, which I understand, but the problem is he doesn’t do any basic foot hygiene at all.
If I ask his to cut his toenails and wash his feet he won’t do it for days at minimum, and generally by the time I ask him to cut his toenails they are already reeking of toe cheese. 

He said he will file the nail and I asked if he knew how to do it. He didnt reply so i asked again if i could just do this last toe because otherwise it will scratch me, to which he replied “Well I’ll just scratch you then."" At this point I was starting to get pretty mad because if he did this when I asked, or better without being asked we wouldn’t have a problem to being with. 

The argument continued to escalate, he kept going on about how I didn’t believe that I hurt him even though I apologised when it happened, I was just trying to make it clear that if he hadn’t been jerking his foot the way a puppy jerks their paw when getting their nails clipped, I wouldn’t have cut too low for a second time. I’ll admit I did feel a bit like he was overreacting, and the only reason he wouldn’t let me just file the nail and finish the job was to be spiteful. 

At that point we started arguing about a whole bunch of other stuff as well, and now I feel like shit, I feel like I overstepped and was being irrational. 

TLDR I cut my bfs toenail too short because he kept jerking him foot, and he got really mad at me.

,AmItheAsshole,"Throwaway. I (24F) am dating a Chinese British man (24M) for 4 years. For background information I have enjoyed kpop,anime and kdramas since I was in high school because of my parents. They both enjoyed this sort of content and games since I was young so I have always seen my interests as part of my childhood because I watched and listened to East Asian content from a young age with them.

My boyfriend at the start of us dating told me he didn’t particularly enjoy kpop but never showed an issue with it until recently. He called me obsessed, weird and said that I will have sexual fantasies about Korean men since I predominantly listen to boy groups such as (big bang, shinee and exo). He recently went to a concert with me to watch a kpop group but made comments such as that my outfit is showing off my boobs for them, telling me not to get wet over them and that he is only going with me because he doesn’t trust me. This has caused a lot of arguments and him debating if I’m right for him.

For further context, I have dated men from various ethnic backgrounds and I am not a fan of newer groups as I see my enjoyment of kpop as nostalgic.

We dated long-distance for a year and saw each other twice—once she came to here and stayed for a month, and the other time I spent almost three months in her country. Early on, when she visited me, things went well with almost no conflicts. But when I went to her with eight months of dating, I noticed some troubling behaviors:

* She yelled at her mom and even told her to shut up;
* She would restrict when I could shower depending on her mood;
* When I made her breakfast, she simply said, “You eat it;”
* In a discussion where we were trying to work things out, she went to check social media;
* When I gave her flowers, she just had a closed-off expression;
* I wanted her to learn my language to better communicate with my family, but she always said she wouldn’t because she was “too lazy”;
* She gave me the silent treatment.

On top of this, her mom put a lot of pressure on me to propose, to the point where I wasn’t allowed to discuss our future until I formally asked for her hand. After I returned to Brazil, almost anything caused arguments. She rarely picked up my calls or responded to messages, sometimes going four days without replying and blaming it on me. This affected me deeply, even impacting my work.

These issues happened maybe 10-15% of the time I was with her; most of the time, she was a great person, and I have no complaints in that regard. I just couldn’t see a future with someone who behaved that way. After I returned to my country, we stayed together for about a month longer, but half that time was spent in conflict.

When I decided to end things, she promised she would change, but I had already made up my mind. It was tough, but afterward, I felt better, free from the constant anxiety caused by our fights.

After the breakup, I got closer to someone from our shared social circle here. She was the complete opposite, and as we talked regularly, we started going out, and now we’ve been dating for a short time.

So far, things have been great. I was completely transparent with her about the risk she was taking in dating someone so soon after a breakup, and she was fine with it.

After I left town, she added me back to her instagram stories and I saw her with him. All I could send her is a &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; message and she never replied. I told her that this is unacceptable and she needs to decide between the two of them but she still hadn&amp;#39;t done anything about it. Her gf came to our town from abroad just to visit her for 2 weeks, and Mary told me that she will be leaving to her bf&amp;#39;s right after her gf left town. I feel very bad for the gf and I feel guilty for not doing anything. We never met but she is the sweetest girl ever and seeing my friend cheat on her is driving me crazy. Would I be the asshole if I told my friend&amp;#39;s gf that she is cheating on her?&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"I have an older brother David (41). David has boundary issues and was in the learning disabled classes. My parents never let him out of the home. He has an very rough personality and because he was never allowed to work or do anything so in his 40’s he doesn’t have friends. He still dominates the conversation at every holiday with “fun facts” and goes off on those and doesn’t realize no one is listening. 

My other siblings and I just really don’t like David because my parents let him do whatever and just dominate whatever social settings we are in. My older sister eloped because of David being my mom kept trying to find David a “place” at her wedding. 

I’m getting married to Mel, and my youngest brother Nick is my best man. My sister who is close to Mel is in the bridal party.  Her husband is one of my best men and their son is a ring bearer.  My wife wants a real wedding and not be forced to elope like my sister did. 

David has no place. He’s not going to be invited because the first thing he did was insult the ring I got my Mel was his “fun facts” about how diamonds are worthless and do not resell well. I should have got her a second hand engagement ring or a colored stone engagement ring. We then got a history on engagement rings and marriage tradition. We tried shutting him up but he wouldn’t and my mom said let “the professor talk” Even at 40 she thinks my brother ""fun facts"" are cute. 

This put a hard no on Mel’s stance that my brother can't come to the wedding. If my parents defend him, even once, they are not coming. She not having not wedding like my sister and it’s time for David to be put in his place. 

Mom called and asked about wedding planning and I told her she wasn’t involved after what happened to my sister wedding dress shopping (Mom brought David who told everyone his fun facts about wedding dress history) that’s when my sister decided to elope. 

I told mom if she and dad wanted to come to the wedding as guests they can but David isn’t invited. Mom didn’t talk for awhile. I think she started crying because my dad took over the phone call. I told him what upset mom and said David isn’t invited and mom can’t be trusted to be involved in wedding planning without David tagging along. 

Dad said he doesn’t understand why we all hate David and I told him what is wrong with his “fun facts”  My dad said “the boy likes to talk and there’s no harm in it” 

I told my dad that’s the thing there is harm in David’s ""fun facts"" and now no one wants to be around him. 

Dad started arguing saying stuff in defense of David and I told dad we are at a stalemate and I guess all 3 of you won’t be coming to the wedding.  I’m sorry but that is how it is. I ended the conversation with my dad and my mom has been upset texting like a crazy person to everybody about how we all need to understand David. What I’m doing is mean.

,AmItheAsshole,"I, 25F, recently moved back home into my parents’ house following the breakdown of a long-term relationship and subsequent abusive home situation (but alas that is not the subject of this post). Living in the house is myself, my mother (47F), stepfather (44M) and brother (23M). My mother and stepfather married earlier this year and have been in a relationship for the past few years, so I didn’t grow up with him around. Despite this, I really like my stepfather and it’s clear that he adores my mum. My mum was never the sort to date when I was younger, and I was always afraid she would be by herself. 

When I was younger and still living at home, my mum and I used to spend most of our free time together, watching TV shows we liked, playing games and just generally having a lot of fun. My brother was the type to lock himself in his room all day; I didn’t. 

Since returning home, hanging out with my parents is monotonous and boring. They have this set routine of watching the same TV shows every single day once they wake up, and if I dare to watch something that my stepdad doesn’t want to watch, it’s a huge issue with my mum. She spends all day cuddling with my stepdad on the sofa with her iPad. It’s not like it was before. I can’t even talk when they’re engrossed in their shows. I just get cursed out and told to be quiet.

We had an argument a couple of days ago when I wanted to show her a quick 3 minute YouTube video. I knew there was no chance that she would watch it when she was in her routine, so I waited until my parents had gotten ready for work (they work together) and would be leaving in 10 minutes or so. My stepdad was still getting ready and my mum had come into the lounge, so I suggested watching this video. Her exact response was “Do I have to?” and I completely lost my shit. I’d said something like she didn’t have to but I was only asking for 3 minutes of her life. It led onto me getting upset over her insistence on spending every waking moment with her husband and ignoring my existence entirely, and she responded that he was her husband and she should be spending her day with him. I answered that he may be her husband but I am her daughter. I asked for her to do some of the things we used to like doing when he’s in as well, watch an episode of a TV show, play a game for an hour, anything. Maybe he gets a bit upset about it, but I missed the way we used to be. She exclaimed that I was out of line and swiftly left for work with my stepdad as soon as he was ready - he hadn’t overheard any of the conversation, but no doubt they’ve talked about it. 

My real question is, AITA for asking for a disruption to the routine just to do something we like together? Or is their time together their time and I don’t have a right to impede on it?

,AmItheAsshole,"Update going to leave it at this thanks to everyone especially to u/YesterdaySimilar2069. 

He is right. 


Edit: For clarification the request about how the money was spent was because I spent extra for a costume since I was not sure I would be back in time to go pick it out with him. She said she would take him to get what he wanted. So I sent her extra money ontop of the ordered amount. 

Reason I asked for where did the money go was because she has not stated the original amount is not enough nor made a request to increase it. 

This counts for living expenses also. If she needs more she can ask I have never not send her extra if it is something our son needs. Though the amount in question does cover rent food clothing other general living expenses. So yeah I will question if she states I need more for food when I just sent her money. Which has happened so our order is fairly detailed in what the money is supposed to be used for. Since she has lied in the past.

Edit as per requested I sent an extra 400 over because my son wanted a light saber he saw at gamestop which alone was 235 dollars. She did agree verbally that she would take him and get him the stuff he wanted. I sent her the money on the 1st together with the child support payment. 



So my son's mother and I did not work out. I travel 6 to 8 months out the year due to work. His mother has primary custody and I do send the ordered amount and some extra when I can. 

Fast forward to Sunday I am back for the Holidays. I plan to take my son out for Halloween. He wants to be a Jedi, so I showed him my Jedi costume and asked to see the one his mother bought-I did send her extra to get the costume since I knew I would be back before Halloween just was not sure I would be back in time to get him the costume-she told him that's I was going to buy it. 

I was upset but just played it off and said oh that is right and it was in the mail. Thankfully I found a costume  Yesterday. 

I did reach out to his mother when I had a moment in private to ask her where did the money I sent go. She told me that I have no right to question what she does with the money. Our child's needs are being met and that is all that matters. She has primary custody and gets majority say. I told her that the money was meant for our child not her. 

She was not awarded spousal support. This is where I am getting mixed messages and where I wish to know if what I said made me the asshole. 

My mom said I was being the prick by questioning how she was raising our child when I am not around. I do not think I questioning her parenting but I did question how she used the money I sent. She said she would get him the costume. 

If she needed extra for something that is related to him I will always send extra. Yes, early on I was more accommodating. While she was not granted spousal support I did cover her rent and also childcare but she took forever to get a job and when she did get a job it was a retail job even though she has a teaching degree.

&lt;p&gt;Edit: For clarification the request about how the money was spent was because I spent extra for a costume since I was not sure I would be back in time to go pick it out with him. She said she would take him to get what he wanted. So I sent her extra money ontop of the ordered amount. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason I asked for where did the money go was because she has not stated the original amount is not enough nor made a request to increase it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This counts for living expenses also. If she needs more she can ask I have never not send her extra if it is something our son needs. Though the amount in question does cover rent food clothing other general living expenses. So yeah I will question if she states I need more for food when I just sent her money. Which has happened so our order is fairly detailed in what the money is supposed to be used for. Since she has lied in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit as per requested I sent an extra 400 over because my son wanted a light saber he saw at gamestop which alone was 235 dollars. She did agree verbally that she would take him and get him the stuff he wanted. I sent her the money on the 1st together with the child support payment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my son&amp;#39;s mother and I did not work out. I travel 6 to 8 months out the year due to work. His mother has primary custody and I do send the ordered amount and some extra when I can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to Sunday I am back for the Holidays. I plan to take my son out for Halloween. He wants to be a Jedi, so I showed him my Jedi costume and asked to see the one his mother bought-I did send her extra to get the costume since I knew I would be back before Halloween just was not sure I would be back in time to get him the costume-she told him that&amp;#39;s I was going to buy it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was upset but just played it off and said oh that is right and it was in the mail. Thankfully I found a costume  Yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did reach out to his mother when I had a moment in private to ask her where did the money I sent go. She told me that I have no right to question what she does with the money. Our child&amp;#39;s needs are being met and that is all that matters. She has primary custody and gets majority say. I told her that the money was meant for our child not her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was not awarded spousal support. This is where I am getting mixed messages and where I wish to know if what I said made me the asshole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom said I was being the prick by questioning how she was raising our child when I am not around. I do not think I questioning her parenting but I did question how she used the money I sent. She said she would get him the costume. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If she needed extra for something that is related to him I will always send extra. Yes, early on I was more accommodating. While she was not granted spousal support I did cover her rent and also childcare but she took forever to get a job and when she did get a job it was a retail job even though she has a teaching degree.&lt;/p&gt;

My works calmed down over the last few weeks so I've been able to cook for us again, but it's just complaint after complaint. And all about the meat 


I made a chilli, why couldn't I use chicken mince? 

Made toad in the hole, chicken sausages are as nice as pork

Made a steak dinner, why couldn't we have chicken breast? 


I told my partner tonight I was making a apple pork casserole and he asked why it couldn't be apple chicken? I snapped.

,AmItheAsshole,"Tw: SU threads, medicine.

I (F, 28) have been friends with “Dara” (30, F) for over 12 years. We’ve always been close and supportive of each other, especially through struggles with mental health. However, in recent years, I’ve focused on setting boundaries and taking care of my own well-being, which has sometimes created distance between us. I’ve had a lot on my plate—burnout, ADD diagnosis, family issues—and often lack the energy to give everyone the support they need.

A few months ago, after a disagreement, I tried to set boundaries with Dara, who responded with guilt-tripping comments (saying things like; It would be a shame if I die and we don't have any contact) about our friendship. Though we resolved things, I started keeping a bit more emotional distance, limiting my responses to her issues and celebrating her successes when it felt authentic.

Recently, Dara had a crisis in a group chat with our friends Eri and Faya (both in their 30s and pregnant), where she mentioned mixing medications with alcohol. Eri tried to calm her down, and even called D’s mom for help. Dara didn’t take this well, and things got tense. I ended up supporting Eri and Faya privately, but didn’t reach out to Dara, as the group chat dissolved before I had the chance.

Question: Am I wrong for not reaching out to Dara after her episode, even though I supported Eri and Faya? I’m torn between distancing myself for my own well-being and wanting to maintain a long-standing friendship with someone who knows me so well. I don’t mind listening to friends’ problems, but I need the energy for it and don’t want to be blamed if I don’t have it.

Tl;dr: AITA for not supporting my mentally unstable friend Dara but helping Eri and Faya, who were also affected by her actions?

,AmItheAsshole,"So, my [M17] best friend, Henry [M17], has this thing. I wouldn't describe it as a lack of filter, but more of a lack of fear when it comes to the things he says? He will say the most personal things in the worst situations, some of which could get himself or others hurt, and it's like he doesn't know when to stop. 

Typically, the things he talks about are more on the controversial side. Important context, the both of us are trans men living in the deep south. I, naturally, to stay safe, am so deep in the closet that I couldn't claw my way out if I wanted to. He isn't. I understand being out, and believe me, I want to more than anything, but I just don't believe it's safe for me. I'm glad he feels safe, but I worry for him so much. I'm so scared he'll say the wrong thing and get hate crimed or worse.

Today he was talking to a grown man and a guy friend of ours, I was in the conversation too, and he started bringing up controversial things. Gender, sexuality, the fucking upcoming election and voting for Harris [we can't even vote yet???], things like that. I was on edge, but fine. Free speech and all. Then I saw that look in his eyes that he was about to bring me into this, he was gonna mention something about My gender or sexuality.

Usually, I'm able to change the topic pretty quickly whenever he gets like this, but not today. I excused us, saying I had to go to the bathroom and asked if he'd come with me. When we got there, I told him to shut the fuck up, that he was walking a mighty fine line, and that he was putting us both in danger.

He gave me this weird look and told me to quit being an asshole, said he could talk about whatever he wanted, and that nothing was gonna happen to either of us.

Another tidbit of important information, one of my very close friends was murdered 2 years ago. I'm not saying it's because she was a trans woman, but I can't prove it wasn't. Trans people in my town are not fucking treated well. I had a friend that was out, publicly. He's homeschooled now because the treatment was God awful.

I'm trying to keep us safe. I don't want anything bad to happen to us, if this shit about either of us gets back to my parents I'm dead. Sure, I could've phrased it a little better, but I genuinely believe his mouth will get us in huge trouble.

After our little squabble in the bathroom, one of my other friends came up to me a few minutes later and asked what happened, because she heard I was being a douchebag.

I obviously couldn't explain the situation to her, but I guess I can to y'all. What do you think, AITA?

I think I may have been harsh, but surely it was justified, right? I'm not in the wrong here? Or am I? I don't know.

,AmItheAsshole,"Bit of an odd one.  I moved into a new house a few years ago.  From the start, we have gotten a ton of mail addressed to various LLCs that all seem related to a property company (call it ""AptCo"").  Many of them have come with return addresses / logos that I recognize as local plaintiffs' law firms.  In the last 18 months, we have gotten doorbell rings for several certified mail deliveries (which we refuse).  I tried many times to reach out to ""AptCo"", but they have no phone # I can find.  I've emailed every address I can come up with, but I don't get a response.  

I tried to figure out why we are getting the mail, and it turns out the principal of AptCo is a prominent local real estate investor, and almost twenty years ago he used to own and live in our house.  I went to the State Corp Commission website and saw that there were several LLCs with our house as the registered address.  I called them and asked to change it, but they said the request has to come from the owner.  So I am back to square one.

Meanwhile, we recently started to get visits from the sheriff and process servers trying to ""serve"" lawsuit papers.  The first time the sheriff showed up, it was stressful.  The last straw was that a process server showed up when only my 13yo son was home and he was very aggressive with my kid.  That motivated me to try to track down the principal of AptCo.  It turns out he belongs to same golf club that my recently moved-here inlaws joined (really only fancy one in the area), and they got me his email.  I emailed him asking him to change the addresses and I heard nothing back from him.  I asked my inlaws to try to maybe find him at the club and buttonhole him.  They did and he said basically ""have them email my assistant"", which I did, and again got no response.

Here's where I may be the AH.  I made a plan for the next time a process server might show up.  I asked my inlaws, is he a member of any regular golf game or activity?  And indeed, there is a men's group that he is a part of.  The next time process-server showed up (a few weeks ago), I told him this was wrong address, but that he could for sure find the principal of AptCo at XYZ County Club at 2pm any Tuesday.   The next Tuesday, the principal was embarrassed by getting served in front of all his friends at the golf club.  My inlaws said it was the talk of the club.

He must be quite a slumlord, as my address is mistakenly down as registered address for some of his entities and I am getting process servers showing up constantly!

I moved into a new house a few years ago.  From the start, we have gotten a ton of mail addressed to various LLCs that all seem related to a property company (call it &amp;quot;AptCo&amp;quot;).  Many of them have come with return addresses / logos that I recognize as local plaintiffs&amp;#39; law firms.  In the last 18 months, we have gotten doorbell rings for several certified mail deliveries (which we refuse).  I tried many times to reach out to &amp;quot;AptCo&amp;quot;, but they have no phone # I can find.  I&amp;#39;ve emailed every address I can come up with, but I don&amp;#39;t get a response.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to figure out why we are getting the mail, and it turns out the principal of AptCo is a prominent local real estate investor, and almost twenty years ago he used to own and live in our house.  I went to the State Corp Commission website and saw that there were several LLCs with our house as the registered address.  I called them and asked to change it, but they said the request has to come from the owner.  So I am back to square one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we recently started to get visits from the sheriff and process servers trying to &amp;quot;serve&amp;quot; lawsuit papers.  The first time the sheriff showed up, it was stressful.  The last straw was that a process server showed up when only my 13yo son was home and he was very aggressive with my kid.  That motivated me to try to track down the principal of AptCo.  It turns out he belongs to same golf club that my recently moved-here inlaws joined (really only fancy one in the area), and they got me his email.  I emailed him asking him to change the addresses and I heard nothing back from him.  I asked my inlaws to try to maybe find him at the club and buttonhole him.  They did and he said basically &amp;quot;have them email my assistant&amp;quot;, which I did, and again got no response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s where I may be the AH.  I made a plan for the next time a process server might show up.  I asked my inlaws, is he a member of any regular golf game or activity?  And indeed, there is a men&amp;#39;s group that he is a part of.  The next time process-server showed up (a few weeks ago), I told him this was wrong address, but that he could for sure find the principal of AptCo at XYZ County Club at 2pm any Tuesday.   The next Tuesday, the principal was embarrassed by getting served in front of all his friends at the golf club.  My inlaws said it was the talk of the club.

,AmItheAsshole,"I'll (16M) try to keep this brief(ish). 4 years ago my parents found out they were expecting a girl. Even though stuff was all closed and we were meant to stay home, they threw a huge gender reveal because they had always wanted a girl and wanted to celebrate the fact they were getting a girl with everyone they knew. My parents took video of their reaction and one they posted to their socials at the time. It was of them screaming and crying and cheering that they *had their dream come true, getting the child they always dreamed of, the daughter they had always wanted and how they couldn't wait to be parents*. The video got taken down after mom's sister told her she had no idea how lucky she was to have a healthy child and went no contact with my parents (she and her husband had fertility trouble and couldn't have kids).

But I knew from a really early age I disappointed my parents by being a boy. Looking at photos and videos of them before me vs after me, you can see the joy fade. They were told I was a girl. Had clothes, a nursery and everything set up for a girl. They even had a name picked out for girl me. Then I was born a boy. The only ""family photos"" of us I have is from the first couple of weeks of my life. They never bothered to take any with me afterward. There are photos of us with extended family but like just me and them over the 12 years of my life? Nah. And even now they have so many taken with the girl of their dreams they finally had but I'm not in any of them. I also found out through extended family that another family member named me because they didn't want to think of boys names they were so disappointed.

I basically live with them as a distant roommate. We don't eat together or do anything together. Mostly that works for me. My boyfriend (16) was my best friend before we started going out and his family were always more like my family.

I was at his grandparents house to celebrate their wedding anniversary with the family and talk of my parents came up and everyone kinda knows how shitty they are but not really. So I told them about the video and some of my boyfriends family were struggling to believe they'd post it. I showed them a screenshot I had of the video on my mom's account and then showed the video. They were really upset by the reaction. Everyone said it was like they were first time parents and his grandma got kinda teary thinking of me being there at the time watching it.

My parents found out because my boyfriends mom basically told my mom how awful she was. My parents said I had no business showing anyone and wanted to know why I even had it. I told them I keep it in case I need to remember how they really feel about me.

From young, Lisa had always been a girl that was constantly in relationships, getting a new boyfriend every few months. Obviously, I wasn’t too happy about it because all of Lisa’s boyfriends turned out to be complete a-holes. But the thing is, I found it odd how she’d cry everyday after breaking up and then immediately find a new boyfriend.

As time went on, Lisa started dating guys that were much older than her and honestly, it irked me. I mean, what kind of decent guy would go for a kid? So I tried to talk her out of it, to tell her just how wrong it was. Lisa hated that tho. We’d get into big fights because she kept saying i was being too judgy when it wasn’t even my life but all I was trying to do was to ensure that she’ll be safe so her dismissing my concern like that made me feel like she didn’t even care about me. Every time she got a new boyfriend, she’d neglect our friendship. And even if we did hang out, all she’d do is rant and complain.

---------------
My family has two heirlooms that we give to a bride or groom when they marry. For the men, it’s a set of cufflinks, and for the women, it’s a bracelet. My oldest son and my oldest sister are married, and their spouses wore the bracelet or cufflinks at their weddings. This tradition is essentially our family’s way of saying, “We’re accepting you into the family.”

When my future DIL got engaged, I gave her the bracelet and explained that it’s a family heirloom, expressing how meaningful it would be if she wore it at the wedding. I mentioned that she could wear it during the reception if she preferred not to wear it in the ceremony. It’s a white jade bracelet, and I shared its significance with her.

Now, with the wedding only a few months away, there’s a problem. My daughter has been getting to know my future daughter-in-law, and she recently came to me, saying that my future daughter-in-law thinks the bracelet is ugly and has been complaining about it. She even showed me texts where my future daughter-in-law said some hurtful things about me, calling me a “controlling ass” for giving her the bracelet. This was hurt and it feels like a complete rejection, especially since she knows why it’s important. When I asked my son, he said he didn’t know anything about her feelings on this.

&lt;p&gt;My family has two heirlooms that we give to a bride or groom when they marry. For the men, it’s a set of cufflinks, and for the women, it’s a bracelet. My oldest son and my oldest sister are married, and their spouses wore the bracelet or cufflinks at their weddings. This tradition is essentially our family’s way of saying, “We’re accepting you into the family.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my future DIL got engaged, I gave her the bracelet and explained that it’s a family heirloom, expressing how meaningful it would be if she wore it at the wedding. I mentioned that she could wear it during the reception if she preferred not to wear it in the ceremony. It’s a white jade bracelet, and I shared its significance with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with the wedding only a few months away, there’s a problem. My daughter has been getting to know my future daughter-in-law, and she recently came to me, saying that my future daughter-in-law thinks the bracelet is ugly and has been complaining about it. She even showed me texts where my future daughter-in-law said some hurtful things about me, calling me a “controlling ass” for giving her the bracelet. This was hurt and it feels like a complete rejection, especially since she knows why it’s important. When I asked my son, he said he didn’t know anything about her feelings on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since she clearly doesn’t want or respect the bracelet, I asked for it back. That’s when things got messy. She made a big deal about how I was excluding her from the family by taking it back.&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"So, my (29M) sister (32F) has three kids (10, 7, 5). Last month, she asked me if I could watch them for a weekend while she and her husband went on a short anniversary trip. I agreed because I love my nieces and nephew, but I made it clear that I needed at least two weeks’ notice because I work long hours, and I’d have to rearrange my schedule.

Fast forward to this past week. I asked my boss for time off, cleared my weekend, and stocked my house with everything the kids would need. Friday afternoon rolls around, and I’m waiting for her to drop them off. Suddenly, I get a text from her saying they’re not coming. She decided last minute that they were going to a family-friendly resort instead and didn’t need me to watch them anymore. No apology, just, “We’ll do it another time.”

I was frustrated because I had completely cleared my weekend, turned down plans with friends, and rearranged my work schedule for this. I responded by telling her it wasn’t cool to cancel on me last minute like that, especially when I went out of my way to help.

Then, two days later, she called me again asking if I could watch the kids the following weekend. Apparently, something came up with her original plan, and she needed someone to watch them after all. I told her no, I wasn’t available. She got upset and said I was being selfish and punishing her kids for something that wasn’t their fault.

Now she’s mad at me, and my parents are saying I should be more understanding because “things come up when you’re a parent.” I don’t have kids, but I feel like it’s just basic respect to not cancel on someone last minute and then expect them to be available whenever you want.

So, AITA for refusing to watch my sister's kids after she canceled on me last minute?

,AmItheAsshole,"*EDITED FOR CLARITY* 

My friend ""Lily"" (38F) and I (26F) became close quickly after meeting six months ago. She’s new in town, works from home, and doesn’t have many friends here. Her partner was out of the country, and Lily texted me yesterday that she felt unwell with severe period cramps and nausea. I left work early to pick up her six-year-old son, got her some meds, and bought groceries, snacks, and easy-to-eat food. She was very distressed, feeling anxious about not being able to care for her son, and she’s a bit of a hypochondriac, which added to her stress.

While at her place, I received bad news that led to an anxiety attack (Lily took care of me and calmed me down). I had plans to meet a friend from another city, but she decided to come to me instead to support me. I also spoke with another friend who was so concerned that he and his girlfriend came to pick me up by car, as I wasn’t in a good state. Just as I was leaving, Lily became more anxious and asked me to stay, but I couldn’t due to my mental state. I did, however, call my sister, a doctor, who advised that Lily was likely fine but could go to the ER if she worsened. I told Lily to call me if she needed to go to the hospital.

My friends drove me home, and I started to panic again in their car. Later, Lily and her partner started calling and texting me, asking me to return. I told them I was really unwell and didn’t feel safe to leave, so I couldn’t go back. I also asked if they had called the medical assistance phone number, but they hadn’t. Her partner dismissed the ER as an option, insisting that they just wanted me to be there with her and her son as her partner was not in the country. Though I understood, I was in no state to help anyone. When I tried to suggest medical help over the phone, Lily cursed at me, said my problems weren’t as bad as hers, and hung up.

In the morning, I apologized to Lily, offered to help take her son to school and pick him up in the afternoon, and reached out to her partner and another friend. However, they haven’t responded, even though Lily has been reading my messages. Now I feel like I’ve lost her as a friend and am being blamed for not being there, as I’m receiving the silent treatment. I’m heartbroken and unsure if I did the right thing. I really tried my best but feel like it wasn’t enough. I don’t know how she is doing now, as they don’t talk to me.

,AmItheAsshole,"My (26F) parents were never married but my dad has always been present in my life to this day. When I was born, my parents gave me a double-barrel surname, so it’s *mum’slastname-dad’slastname.*

For as long as I can remember, my surname itself has been a source of embarrassment for me, to the point where I’ve always just gone by my mum’s (very common) surname wherever I could (school, work, banks, you name it.). Most people from my past and present know me by my mum’s last name.

Legally changing my surname has been something on my mind on-and-off for the past decade and when I let my dad know this 6/7 years ago, it was a very brief conversation where he said he wasn’t happy about it. That was that – after an uncomfortable silence, he changed the conversation and neither of us has brought it up since.

Fast forward to now, my passport expires next year and I’m currently working towards a qualification that I will hopefully complete next year too (where the qualification provider has refused to let me go by my mum’s surname unless I can prove that I’ve legally changed it). So now seems now a practical time as any.

I’ve had conversations with my mother about doing it – she’s understands (as someone's who’s laughed at my unfortunate last name when I was a kid) but isn’t fully onboard because I’m his only child and it would hurt his feelings.

However, this meeting couldn't happen because a few people had work to do. Then I didn't want to go home and I sat in a library and studied.

,AmItheAsshole,"Hi all. First post here and I suspect first of many. 

Every year, my wife and I have alternated who we go to for Christmas each year, flicking from my parents to hers.  This has always been ok, everyone lives close so no more than a 30 minute drive. 

We now have a 2 1/2 year old and I would like to have Christmas at our house this year. For the last two years, we have taken the Boy to her parents and then mine. So they both had him at least once for Christmas. 

My wife has decided she would like Christmas at her parents this year as they would very much like to see him on Christmas Day. Last year we agreed that would be our last and this year we would have Christmas at ours, just us. 

I really want to do our own thing and make our own traditions but my wife isn't into that at all. In her view we ought to see parents as they won't be around forever (they all range from early to late 70s). In my view, this day in age, people live longer and who knows, they may all live another 10 years.  At which point my Boy will have never had Christmas at ours and will always be dragged away. 

She gets a bit emotional about this and gives me the silent treatment when I say we're having Christmas at home. It's awkward and I just need to know whether I am actually being the asshole. 

Oh, finally, I have said I am happy to have people here Christmas Eve all day to do presents etc. That was received with a mild response so maybe that'll happen.

TW: Drug use

Some context: I’m (M)29, and my partner is (F)31. We’ve been together for around 5 years. Early on, she covered rent, and I handled food. For about 2 years, we earned roughly the same and split family expenses (it was just the two of us then). She found out she was pregnant in March 2023, and in September, her employer didn’t renew her contract, so she went on unemployment benefits. I told her, “Don’t worry, I’ve got this,” and took on most of our expenses.

Drug use has always been part of our lives, but back then, I didn’t see it as an issue. I used to smoke around three times a day myself. Since we had our baby 10 months ago, I’ve cut down to about once a day. She, on the other hand, has ramped up her usage and now spends around 300€ a month on it. I make about 1400€ a month, and she makes around 600€ (180€ of that is government assistance).

I’ve expressed my concerns to her about spending this much, especially since our baby has increased our expenses. But she hasn’t made any changes and told me, “I do what I want with my money.” We don’t have a budget, but her spending impacts us; by halfway through the month, our account is often completely drained, making it hard to cover family needs.

On one hand, I feel I might be in the wrong because I said, “My money is your money,” and I worry that setting financial boundaries now could come off as controlling or unfair. But at the same time, I feel that with our child, we need to be more financially stable. WIBTA?

EDIT1: I see that my original post wasn’t clear enough, so I’d like to clarify a few things:

\- I should have made this clearer. I’m deeply concerned about how her drug use affects her ability to care for our child, and I am taking steps to make sure our child is safe.  
\- Talking about her usage directly has been difficult. I have tried bringing it up before, but she insists she’s “in control.” That’s why I chose to approach things from a financial angle—it's a way to address the issue without getting caught in a cycle of denial or defensiveness, which has happened in past conversations.  
\- Our usage is not the same. I do smoke, but it’s not daily, and I’m actively reducing my own use, especially since our child was born. She, on the other hand, is using harder substances and has increased her usage. I know it’s not ideal for me to use at all, but I’m working to cut back and shift my focus to what’s best for our child.

EDIT2 : I want to sincerely apologize if I offended anyone with my post. I recognize that my focus was misplaced, and I’m waking up late to the reality of our situation. It’s clear that I need to act quickly to ensure my child’s safety, and I appreciate the urgency of these concerns. Thank you all for your insights and for opening my eyes to my own shortcomings—I realize I need to change my behavior as well.

,AmItheAsshole,"In November myself and a group of my life long friends are planning to go on a trip to visit one of my best friends who has just had a baby. 
To give context of the group dynamics of the people who are going, it’s me (27F), my older brother, my female friend and her husband, the husbands little brother (much younger than myself) and my other female friend. Now to give context I have known this group of people nearly my whole life and love and trust them dearly, as well as hanging out with them nearly every week. For this weekend we have booked a cottage where everyone has their own rooms and are planning to surprise my friend (who’s just had a baby). So we have planned this with her husband and she has no idea we are coming (bare in mind she has been asking me to see and visit her baby for a few months now and I’m sensing she’s getting upset that I haven’t yet). The weekend is planned to be a chilled weekend (no drinking) mainly walks and board game nights/dinner. Now, upon inviting my boyfriend (27M) (as I thought it would be the perfect opportunity for him to meet most of my best friends at once) we have had a massive argument as he is not happy for me to stay in the cottage as there will be other men there. He said he doesn’t care if the men are married, gay, bisexual or asexual he is not happy with the arrangement. I argued that my brother is present, and the other is married and will be sharing a room with his wife (one of my best friends) and the other is significantly younger than me. He is aware that I hang out with these people very often however he argues that even if I have known these men my whole life and have formed friendships with them they could still be a danger to me and I should therefore either cancel the trip or find another accommodation. I have now agreed to cancel the trip (which he doesn’t seem to care about) if I don’t find an accommodation on my own but I am very resentful about the situation and don’t think I should have to, but I am compromising because I love him. During the argument he gave me an ultimatum to suggest that if I go ahead without changing the circumstances of the accommodation he would break up with me. I will find it so awkward to explain to my friends why I am staying at a separate accommodation to everyone while everyone is having this weekend away. I even offered for him to meet the group before the weekend away as he can’t make it, he said it won’t make a difference to the situation. To add to this, this weekend, my boyfriend can’t make it as he is going to his friend (who’s a female) birthday party, where there will be other females who I don’t know and he doesn’t know and there will be alcohol and possibly more. He argues that this is okay because ultimately he will stay in an air b and b with his male friends at the end of the night.

,AmItheAsshole,"So September last year, my friend &amp; I decided to purchase tickets for a 3 day music festival with camping in March 2024. Total was roughly, $700 each. Note that she lives in a different state to me (Australia). I recommended she buy flights asap, or as soon as they come up on sale but regardless, flights from her state to mine aren't v expensive. You can easily get flights for &gt;$200 return, even less on sale.

December last year, she decided to quit her well paying job. I again recommended getting flights before she no longer had a income. Instead, she got a kitten.

I sent her a message a few weeks before the event checking on her travel plans. She still hadn't bought flights &amp; was conflicted about attending because of her kitten.

It comes to the week of &amp; I'd been calling her daily to see if she'd made a decision. Its only TWO DAYS before the start of the festival that she conclusively says she won't be attending. She also specifically said, “Do you have anyone that would take my ticket?”

Unfortunately, no one else in my life enjoys this genre of music. I also am not safely able to attend a 3 day festival solo due to serious medical conditions.

Once she said she wasn't coming, I immediately listed both our tickets on the official resale website, as well as, 2 other resale sites. The festival was sold out, so I was hopeful that they would be sold but unfortunately there were hundreds of other tickets up for sale. I even saw some listed for as low as $67. I had exactly 1 enquiry about the tickets, which lead nowhere.

Regardless, I waited until the Thursday night before I packed my campervan and got ready for the festival &amp; still even left the tickets up until we were driving to the festival. I managed to convince my bf to come with me, despite him disliking the genre immensely.

After the festival, my friend asked me when I was going to pay her for the ticket.

Her argument is that my bf used the ticket so either him or I should pay. My counter argument was that:

1 She bailed last minute.

2. I tried to sell the tickets but they didn't sell.

3. She knew it wasn't safe for me to attend solo, leaving me the options of waste both tickets or pay for both, which I can't afford.

4. She had said to me “Do you have anyone that can take my ticket” which to me meant the ticket was on offer for anyone available to go with me.

5. I don't believe my bf should have to pay either as he was attending only as a favour to me.

Everyone I've spoken to agree I'm in the right. She said that she spoke to people that believe that I should pay the full amount of the ticket, but I wonder if she actually provided the full story. She did not reply to my last two messages, &amp; this has been weighing on me so I thought I’d get the opinion of some internet strangers before I attempt to reach out again lol. There's more context/info but kept short for post limit!

So, tell me reddit, AITA for not paying her for the ticket?

  
EDIT: To add further context, the same situation happened in reverse in 2022. I had tickets to an event in her city but came down with COVID 2 days before and wasn't able to travel.

,AmItheAsshole,"My parents are struggling financially, mainly because my mother refuses to work due to a knee issue and spends her time on Facebook. My mother also would never be able to survive a real job because she goes off the handle if you even imply she is incorrect in any way. I (20 F )am a college student, work part-time, do after-school activities for my degree and I do not eat at home due to lack of food, as my parents spend money on junk food instead. I stopped giving money for food as it was not used to buy meals. during the summer I have been staying at my grandmother's house where I can eat my food so I buy my own there and help with chores. My parents berate me for not contributing financially or doing chores at home, despite my absence for several months. I tried to explain to them that I could not afford to support the family (parents and 3 siblings) and my own needs. I also know it's not really about the chores because I was never taught by my mother ""her way of doing them"" because of my mother's OCD. We physically aren't allowed to do the chores. but that's a problem because my mom doesn't do them either even though she is ""the only one who can do it right"" and a SAHM.

My parents also manipulated my aging grandmother into giving them the savings my late grandpa and she saved for me, arguing that I would ""waste it"" even though I only mentioned using it for a house and a wedding. I don't even know which bank it's in I think this and their demanding money for food I don't even eat shows their true intentions. Luckily I also have my savings but is much less them what I was told was in that account.

Tonight, they got angry when I spent $20 on candy to give to trick-or-treaters with my Boyfriend, Halloween is a holiday my boyfriend and I love because we go all out with spooky displays and costumes. They demanded the money or my help in handing out candy this year (they don't have candy so idk what they are talking about) because they didn't want to do it. They called me names and threatened eviction, on top of other abusive behavior. I feel trapped and mistreated by my parents, who have always acted this way towards us. they never cared and have always acted like they were the best for doing what was minimum required by law. Despite wanting to leave, I currently have no viable means to do so or trust me I would in a heartbeat. it feels so unstable here and I don't feel safe but sadly I am trapped.

,AmItheAsshole,"I come from a family of 3 including my mom and my little sis. I lost my Dad when I was 10 and my mom single handedly did her very best to make everything seem as if Dad were still around.She never had support from relatives and obviously made countless sacrifices as we were growing up.

I got married in 2022 and moved to NZ.As soon as we got married, my in laws spun into action by making me convert all my bank accounts into joint accounts with my husband. At the time, their reason was that it would be beneficial for my move to NZ. I constantly turned a blind eye giving them the benefit of the doubt.

Enter husband. The red flags started popping up immediately after our wedding. His total lack of compassion is mind boggling. I used to tell myself maybe he's just shy. I used to get depressed constantly, but I told myself that I'm stuck with this now and maybe I'm the one who needs an attitude change.

So the latest issue began when my mom told me over the phone that she would really like to visit Turkey with one of her friends. My husband who was attending the call with me just stormed off, making the whole thing really odd. He then started arguing with me that I should make her understand that going on expensive international trips at this time is a bad idea, she should be saving money for my sister when she needs to get married. Truth be told, even I thought it was a bad idea at the time since mom just travelled to Singapore this year. But I brushed off his concerns saying that even if I am to object, she wouldn't listen to me and would end up in an argument. Besides, the trip wasn't confirmed at all. We ended up not speaking that whole weekend. I finally lost it and started pushing his buttons to know why exactly he's so concerned about this and ultimately it slipped from his mouth - He doesn't want my Mom to approach us for money after she spends all of hers. I told him it's none of his business what my mom chooses to do with her money and she's never approached us for help. Even if she does, it's my responsibility and I will not abandon my family. My Mom's getting older and has the fomo about not being able to travel and see beautiful places. Things escalated pretty quickly after that and my in laws got involved. I work a good job and is single handedly putting my husband through college. If I ever mention even in the slightest way about me being the breadwinner, they turn the whole thing against me.This is the first time I raised my voice against them because I understood that they really look down on me and my family.Everything's come crashing down on me to a point that even the things I do on a daily basis while maintaining a busy schedule are at fault. It seems like they want me to cast out my side of the family completely.   I'm not totally a saint here. I should have controlled my emotions better. But I expect any good human being to stand up for their family when they are being treated wrongly.

Am I the asshole?

Edit: I couldn't fit everything in the original post. The main reason I asked whether I'm the asshole is because I lost my temper at my husband and in laws. I became really violent and was screaming and shouting because I wasn't being heard at all. I knew he was pushing my buttons to get me to react but I fall for it all the time. At one point I even raised my hand to slap him when he talked shit about my Mom. On top of all this, because he's studying social practice, he thinks he can armchair diagnose anyone with mental disorders. Recently he's started accusing me of being bipolar since I get very angry at times but very loving the rest of the time. I'm sorry but I thought human beings are supposed to have different emotions. How can he even accuse the person putting him through college of having a mental illness? 
I see all of your comments about leaving him. It's much more easier than done. It'll ruin me and my family. Where I come from, divorce is very much frowned upon. Which is why I wanna give my husband and IL to change their attitude. It doesn't mean I'm gonna say goodbye to my self respect. I'm actually in the process of starting my own bank account. I have really good reasons now to make this change and if they question my decision, I can point it back to their poor decisions to hurt me. Their self righteousness isn't gonna allow them to accept it though. I appreciate all the comments that helped me realize that I should be looking out for myself.

My girlfriend Lana started talking about 3 days ago about how she has had so much trouble focusing on her studies lately that she might possibly have undiagnosed ADHD and that she should go get tested. Earlier today while Lana and I were out with her mother I was trying to answer some questions that Lana's mom was asking us and Lana kept interrupting me while I was talking. After 2 or 3 times of her interrupting me I sighed and did an exaggerated pause after she was done talking. She was a bit upset that I made a scene in front of her mother and I agree that I was partially out of line there. 
Fast forward to tonight while we're getting ready for bed she apologizes for interrupting me earlier and that she thinks it's because of the ADHD. I laughed and told her not to self diagnose just yet, and she tells me it's okay because she is almost 100% sure that she has it. I told her that, while I'm not saying she doesn't have it, it's not impossible that she may not have it. She then began getting really upset with me for saying that ""It was all in her head and that she was making it up."" I then told her I didn't say that and repeated exactly what I said from above again. Here I said something I might regret. I told her that I might be upset if she didn't take back what she said. She then remembered and sort of apologized. A few minutes later I asked her why she made those things up about me just now (I realize now that I could have phrased this better). She got really mad at me for ""accusing her"" and that she didn't make anything up. I said I was sorry for phrasing it like that but I wasn't okay with her speaking to me like that and then just going to bed like nothing happened and that I didn't want to let her walk all over me this time (I regret this part as well). She told me I was making her out to be the villain, to which I responded that she was making ME the villain. Then, Lana said ""I mean, If you want me to go sleep in the other room I will but I don't think either of us did anything wrong."" I was about to start panicking and in the moment I wanted to be alone so I said ""Will you?"" She looked shocked and asked if I was serious to which I said ""Yes, please."" I was trying not to cry and  I felt a panic attack coming on. 
After a few minutes had passed of being alone I sent her this text:

I love you baby. Please know that I'm not going to bed angry at you. I just need time to cool off. I promise we'll talk in the morning. Goodnight my love.

She got really mad at me for &amp;quot;accusing her&amp;quot; and that she didn&amp;#39;t make anything up. I said I was sorry for phrasing it like that but I wasn&amp;#39;t okay with her speaking to me like that and then just going to bed like nothing happened and that I didn&amp;#39;t want to let her walk all over me this time (I regret this part as well). She told me I was making her out to be the villain, to which I responded that she was making ME the villain. Then, Lana said &amp;quot;I mean, If you want me to go sleep in the other room I will but I don&amp;#39;t think either of us did anything wrong.&amp;quot; I was about to start panicking and in the moment I wanted to be alone so I said &amp;quot;Will you?&amp;quot; She looked shocked and asked if I was serious to which I said &amp;quot;Yes, please.&amp;quot; I was trying not to cry and  I felt a panic attack coming on. 
After a few minutes had passed of being alone I sent her this text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you baby. Please know that I&amp;#39;m not going to bed angry at you. I just need time to cool off. I promise we&amp;#39;ll talk in the morning. Goodnight my love. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;#39;ve had some time to think, I&amp;#39;m starting to think that she was right. Am I  overreacting? AITA??&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"Hello everyone. Here is the situation. My wife and I went on an a trip out of the country for five days. We use rover to find a dog sitter. About a year ago we found a gal and she was great. Dogs loved her and we used her 2 times. Never had any issues except her cancelling on us twice, two hours before we left for our trips. We get it though, things happen and we didn’t hold it against her. We just made sure to have my brother as back up in case she cancelled. Anyway, we left for Mexico and we have a ring camera on our front door. She knows this and she’s also house sitting and spending the night. Not just drop ins. We have three dogs, well behaved but my dogs need to wear wraps on their bellies because they are old and sometimes pee in the house. They are never on longer than a few hours and they are totally comfortable in them. We specified on rover that we would like them taken out every 2-3 hours but if she need to leave, but they can be alone for about 8 hours.

We called her and she said “oh I came back at 12 and let them out.” Two things here, no she didn’t. There was nothing on the ring so she’s lying and even if it were true, that’s still 12 hours of her not letting them out or feeding them. We asked her to leave our house immediately and that we will be contacting rover to make sure she doesn’t watch dogs again. I genuinely cannot understand leaving dogs for that long. We called my father in law and he was able to drive an hour over to let them out and is watching them. He said they are their food in 30 seconds when it typically takes them 3-4 minutes.

,AmItheAsshole,"So my (24m) GF (26f) and I have been together a year and a half now. She is from Thailand, she drove an automatic car there (learnt in a manual though so has a manual license here) 

She doesn’t own a car here. We only have my car and I have told her she can use it whenever… but she won’t. However, I’ve managed to start getting her to driver her self to work (it is only 4 minutes from our home). We live in a city. 

However, anywhere further than that, and she just won’t do it. Says it’s too far to drive her self. I’ve been to Thailand, and the driving situation where she is from is far scarier (obviously in my opinion) than here 

However, we have my mother here at the moment visiting, and she has told me that I need to tell my GF to start driving her self to places where I am not needed - hair appointment, dentist, work etc etc because in our relationship we need to ‘start as we mean to go on’ which I think is fair. 

So my GF has a dentist appointment tonight which is a 25 minute drive from our apartment (she could have picked a dentist closer but this one was recommended to her by her boss) 
I have been at work today. She went to uni this morning for a few hours then has been at her mates since early afternoon. 

So I told her that she needs to drive her self and that I am sorry, but I don’t want to be running around after her our whole lives when she is more than capable of driving. 

She is now mad at me.

,AmItheAsshole,"Throwaway since one of my roomies knows my reddit.

I (20f) and my 3 friends (~20f) are all juniors in college who share an on-campus apartment. The last 2 years I have had single dorm rooms due to my social anxiety but I got to know these 3 girls well the past 2 years and even though I was nervous, I thought they'd be great to live with. And they were. Until recently. 
My school has a thing where seniors aren't allowed to live on campus, we have to get off-campus housing to help us prepare for living on our own, but the school will help us figure out rent and stuff. My roomies haven't talked about it at all but I've heard enough from others who already have their housing that I decide to be the one to bring it up with them. I want to get a good and affordable apartment early, after all, and people are snatching them up. This is especially important since one of my roomies is from a low-income family. 

Well, it turns out that they already got an apartment...3 weeks ago. For 3 people, myself not included. When I asked why I wouldn't have been included in this, one of them said ""I thought you already had a place"" which makes no sense because I had not once talked about housing and I also have no other friends in my grade, they're all seniors. 
While I thought I was good friends with these three, they *do* hang out a lot without me - not as intentional exclusion, but they're all morning people who go out for breakfast together every day, while I sleep in and don't eat breakfast. They seem to have all gotten closer to each other during this time, leaving me behind, which isn't any of our faults in and of itself, but I know the housing discussion must have all happened during breakfasts. And they just...never told me or even asked. 

I have no idea what to do about next year. I can't live with strangers due to my anxiety and if there's no place I can afford I am worried I'll have to transfer schools. I'm hoping they can make a disability accommodation for me, my anxiety is an actual disability and is the reason I was guaranteed a single room the past 2 years. 

Things have been...awkward with my roomies for the past few days and I'm starting to feel a lot less comfortable living with them. I'd really like to switch rooms when the semester is over and go back to a single dorm like I have had in the past. 

But I have two worries about that. If I leave, there are two options.
 
1) the 3 girls' housing cost goes up because they still have to pay for a 4-person apartment, and like I said earlier, one is from a low-income family and can already barely afford college. 

2) they get a new roomie to replace me. one of the other girls is very much like me, with really bad social anxiety and while she has a few other friends in our grade, it's unlikely that she could get one of them and she could also not handle having a random person as a roomie. 

So, WIBTA if I switched rooms for the new semester, even if it meant majorly screwing over one of my roomies?

,AmItheAsshole,"On mobile so I'm sorry for any format issues. I've changed the names for this story due to this being a throwaway account.

I'm 23 male, I have a roommate who we will name Alice for this story. She is 22 female. For some background, we have been living together for almost 4 years now. I would also like to note that we both struggle with mental health. I am on antidepressants and go to therapy. Alice has stopped going to therapy and will give me excuses as to why she isn't going anymore. She is on mood stabilizers and will stop taking them without telling me or her long distance boyfriend. While I do understand that with mood stabilizers people tend to feel this way and will stop taking them. I wish she would talk to either of us about it so we are aware. I've always tried to be supportive but recently I can't anymore.

I had a friend who was going through a tough time and I had asked Alice if it would be ok if said friend stayed for a while. Alice seemed ok with it. However, she said that ""said friend would have to be ok with us being messy"". That's when I started noticing all of her behavior. I will admit, I might not be the cleanest person but I keep it all to my room. While Alice's stuff spills out into the Common areas. I've tried talking to her about it but nothing changes. This is when I noticed the pattern of us being ok for a while and then her not doing her meds and our relationship going downhill. I've reached my breaking point. I feel like I'm constantly walking on egg shells at home. Everything happened a few months after we had just renewed our lease. I've tried to talk to her about how I feel but she ends up blowing up at or ignoring me.

I can't have people over without her permission even though we both pay the rent. I've been out of a relationship since we moved in together due to me having a nasty relationship before we moved in. Well, I was talking with a guy and he can't come over unless she has met him. I've tried a few times to arrange a time to when they can met but she always gives me excuses. 

Recently her boyfriend flew in. I like her boyfriend, he helps around the apartment,ect. Well they went away for the weekend and she told me this ""Hey I'm going to give you a pass this one time if you want that guy to come over while we are gone, without me having to met him"". It just left a sour taste in my mouth.

She can't seem to be ok with me being happy. Whenever I've tried to talk to her about how I'm getting better with relationships and notice red flags,ect. she just blows me off. She will bring up past mistakes I've made which is uncalled for.

I don't know what to think anymore. If I move out or leave then I don't know what she will do. I'm one of her only friends and her boyfriend lives out of state. She has a rocky relationship with her dad (mom isn't around) and if I leave then she would probably have to move back in with him.

I&amp;#39;ve been out of a relationship since we moved in together due to me having a nasty relationship before we moved in. Well, I was talking with a guy and he can&amp;#39;t come over unless she has met him. I&amp;#39;ve tried a few times to arrange a time to when they can met but she always gives me excuses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently her boyfriend flew in. I like her boyfriend, he helps around the apartment,ect. Well they went away for the weekend and she told me this &amp;quot;Hey I&amp;#39;m going to give you a pass this one time if you want that guy to come over while we are gone, without me having to met him&amp;quot;. It just left a sour taste in my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She can&amp;#39;t seem to be ok with me being happy. Whenever I&amp;#39;ve tried to talk to her about how I&amp;#39;m getting better with relationships and notice red flags,ect. she just blows me off. She will bring up past mistakes I&amp;#39;ve made which is uncalled for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to think anymore. If I move out or leave then I don&amp;#39;t know what she will do. I&amp;#39;m one of her only friends and her boyfriend lives out of state. She has a rocky relationship with her dad (mom isn&amp;#39;t around) and if I leave then she would probably have to move back in with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve left out a lot of details for the sake of being anonymous&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, WIBTA for moving out?&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"My partner and I have been living together for about a year. I have a pet who is old but very well behaved and without many accidents around the house. This is probably the last year she'll be around, so I have asked him to please treat her with a lot of love and attention because she is my whole heart. She was an unexpected rescue who had had a hard life before me and I made a promise to give her the best life I can when I found her. I have gone to many extremes for my pet and would make the same decisions every time. I don't have kids or another responsibility like kids in my life, so I don't feel like setting her as my priority in life is wrong, as I am the only person she has. My boyfriend initially accepted this responsibility but he doesn't feel like giving her love and respect is important, just feeding her pretty much. She really loves him though and it breaks my heart to see her try to get his attention, nudge his hand, fall over (bc she old) trying to reach his height, etc, only for him to ignore her. He also eats her favorite snacks in front of her and doesn't share even though the scent has turned her into a hurricane of desire. For this particular kind of pet, these attitudes are really detrimental. 

The problem is that when I see something that is particularly hurtful and hard to watch, I try to tell him about it and since I have no other points of comparison for him since he doesn't love animals, I inevitably fall into a trap of asking him if he would like for me to treat his family the same way. (I.e. Would you like it if I shut the door in your brother's face when he was trying to get my attention or talk to me? How would you feel if you saw your mom falling over a chair just to talk to me and I just ignored her?) This is incredibly offensive to him and he cannot understand my point at all. He thinks I am saying that his family is animals, I guess, but I have a difficult time understanding why he can't understand that I am just trying to put him into my shoes, even though the comparison isn't perfect obviously. 

In my opinion, if he told me that an insect was the most important responsibility in his life I would treat it as such. If he told me that a plant was the most important responsibility in his life and that I spend an hour a day blowing my CO2 on it, I would do it. And if he compared me ignoring his plant to ignoring my pet, I wouldn't get offended or say one has nothing to do with the other. I would just do it and understand that he has a certain love for a living thing that I cannot understand, but I would spend the time, dedication and intention that he asked me to.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (22f) have guardianship/custody of my younger siblings (D - 17m; E - 15f; K - 12f; F - 9m). They regularly spend a few days at our brother’s (V - 26m) place.

V and I don’t have the best relationship but he gets along great with the younger kids and they love staying at his place. I don’t have a problem with them visiting him as long as either D or E are there to supervise.

Yesterday, I picked them up from V’s place. When I got there, there was another boy. I thought he was a friend of E so I offered him a ride home but he declined and said that he lived there.

Before we left I asked V why he had a random teenager living with him. He told me that the boy was his girlfriend’s nephew.

He’s not though. I didn’t say anything at the time because I didn’t want to start a fight but I know that his girlfriend doesn’t have any siblings.

When we got home I told them that I didn’t want them to visit V for a while which caused a huge fight and now the younger 2 won’t talk to me and E has threatened to run away because I’m such a bitch.

D doesn’t really care because he only really came along to supervise the younger ones but when I asked him about the other kid he said he didn’t know him but that he definitely wasn’t his girlfriend’s nephew.

I’m not sure if I may have overreacted because of the complicated relationship I have with V. After having slept on this, I’d really appreciate an outsider’s opinion. Also, you may have noticed that I’m not a native english speaker, so please let me know if there’s anything unclear.

*Edit*

My brother's girlfriend finally messaged me back. I was right, he's not her nephew or in any way related to her. They're currently fighting because my brother refuses to tell her the truth.

,AmItheAsshole,"I am 18M, have a group of five other friends (so six guys all together) whom I have been friends with since elementary school. We are all 18M, just started college this year, with us split up into different schools for the first in over a decade. We have celebrated all of our 18th birthdays together this year. Five of us have already celebrated our bdays, with the last one, my friend Shaun, having his birthday this week. 

originally we were all going to meet at one of the other guys' college for the weekend to go to a concert that was happening there, however the show has been postponed. Shaun now has another concert he wants us to go to, that's in his college town. here's the thing, Shaun now attends what was previously my top choice college. I wanted to go there since I was like 14. I visited it twice for tours. it was my dream school, and I didn't get in. I was crushed, and still am. I am learning to enjoy the college I do attend, I have met some cool people already, I like my professors, I am certain I will enjoy my four years here; but there's a large piece of me right now that still wishes I was attending the college that I didn't get into. 

the rejection was hard to take. Shaun knew it was my top choice, and he did his best to support me when results came out, but I was also very cognizant that I didn't want to take away from his joy and the success he deserves to celebrate, so I mostly hid how upset I was. but I was/am devastated, to lose a dream I had for so long. if I go to concert we'd be staying in a hotel that right off the college campus, which I'm sure we'd end up visiting or doing something in, and honestly I just do not want to visit the college yet. truthfully I am still in my feelings, I am still sad not to be attending. 

I am thinking of backing out, and trying to come up with an excuse about why I don't want to go (although it will be hard since Shaun already knows I have the weekend free, since I was suppose to be attending the other concert). However, I worry this would be an asshole move, because we have really made a big deal of celebrating each other's birthdays this year, and my absence would make me only guy in the group to miss any birthday event. we also promised that even though Shaun's birthday was once we had all started our new schools, we would still meet up to celebrate him for his birthday ike he did everyone else's before him. but I really don't want to walk on that campus yet.

I am learning to enjoy the college I do attend, I have met some cool people already, I like my professors, I am certain I will enjoy my four years here; but there&amp;#39;s a large piece of me right now that still wishes I was attending the college that I didn&amp;#39;t get into. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the rejection was hard to take. Shaun knew it was my top choice, and he did his best to support me when results came out, but I was also very cognizant that I didn&amp;#39;t want to take away from his joy and the success he deserves to celebrate, so I mostly hid how upset I was. but I was/am devastated, to lose a dream I had for so long. if I go to concert we&amp;#39;d be staying in a hotel that right off the college campus, which I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;d end up visiting or doing something in, and honestly I just do not want to visit the college yet. truthfully I am still in my feelings, I am still sad not to be attending. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of backing out, and trying to come up with an excuse about why I don&amp;#39;t want to go (although it will be hard since Shaun already knows I have the weekend free, since I was suppose to be attending the other concert). However, I worry this would be an asshole move, because we have really made a big deal of celebrating each other&amp;#39;s birthdays this year, and my absence would make me only guy in the group to miss any birthday event. we also promised that even though Shaun&amp;#39;s birthday was once we had all started our new schools, we would still meet up to celebrate him for his birthday ike he did everyone else&amp;#39;s before him. but I really don&amp;#39;t want to walk on that campus yet. WIBTA if skipped Shaun&amp;#39;s birthday?&lt;/p&gt;

AITA for being mad at my husband for making fun of my appearance?

Hi everyone, I’m honestly feeling pretty hurt and unsure if I’m overreacting, so I thought I’d ask here.

My husband has a habit of making comments about my appearance that feel hurtful. It started with little things, like touching my forehead and pretending to measure it, saying I have the biggest forehead he’s ever seen. I’ve seen him make fun of other people for this before, calling a girl “the ugliest of them all” because of her forehead, so it really stings when he says that to me.

There have been other comments, too. When I had a pimple, he looked at me disgustedly and asked when it was finally going away because “I’ve had it for a long time.” Another time, as I walked away, he made a comment about how flat my butt was. Yesterday was the last straw for me: I was telling him about some issues I’ve been having with my period, spotting outside my normal cycle, and he picked up my feet and, once we finished talking, said they looked like “hooves.” When I got upset, he brushed it off, saying I was only mad because i was on my period.

I’ve told him repeatedly that these comments make me feel insecure and hurt, and I’ve asked him to stop. But he keeps doing it. AITA for being angry about this, or am I overreacting?

tonight after his car started smoking, i told him through text that “maybe it’s time to take it in to a shop” he then asked “why the fuck would i take it into a shop” i just said “i’m just trying to help i’m sorry i’ll stop”. he came home, i could tell he was irritated (understandably so). he went outside to work on his car and after an hour i went to go check on him, to see if i could do anything or if he just wanted someone to talk to. he had told me that “i understand that you’re just trying to help but i don’t appreciate being fucking gaslit with the i’m sorry shit” and that “every time i vent to you, you’re irritated. i don’t think you understand the seriousness of the situation i don’t have the money to pay a mechanic.” i did grow irritated and snapped asking “how am i gaslighting you by saying that? i don’t appreciate you telling me how i’m supposed to be feeling.” he sort of sighed and said “i cant have this conversation right now, can you please just leave? i’m not trying to be an asshole.” now here i sit, typing to strangers on reddit bc my thoughts are so disorganized right now.

Tay and Riley dated, but ended up breaking up for reasons Tay did not want to tell me. Riley and I ended up falling for each other. Riley eventually wanted to date, (we were currently “talking”), but I refused until a few more months passed, when we would end up going to a different school than Tay because of our differing career paths. Riley and I intended on never telling my friend Tay that we were talking, or that we liked each other, so Tay would not be hurt. When we moved schools, we could date freely, so for now, our friend groups also agreed on keeping this a secret from Tay. I did care a lot about Tay, but I could not help my feelings for Riley. Due to an incident that happened with Riley, I decided to distance myself from Riley, but Tay did find out somehow about us, but never told me how. Tay forgave me, and we decided to put what happened past ourselves, and remained friends. 



Some time passed, and I met someone else that had gotten to know Tay through mutual friends. Let’s call this person Heat. Soon enough I realized that Heat and Tay seemed to be on a talking stage, romantically, though Tay also ended up cutting things off with Heat eventually. With no idea why this happened, I began to get to know Heat more. After months of being friends, I fell for Heat, and Heat seemed mutually interested, seeming to have finally gotten over Tay. We began to flirt more, talk more, and I began to feel like I did with Riley. I thought that maybe, this time, things would work. One day, Heat and I got into an argument over something stupid, but it got to the point where Heat snapped. “I KNOW what you did to Tay in the past. They told me you and their ex were romantically involved, and when they asked you about it you lied several times. You're a horrible person and you have no right to be yelling at me for something stupid when you have done worse.” Heat yelled. I was shocked. I cut off contact with Heat. I was also very mad at Tay for telling Heat what I had done. I know they had gotten close at one point, but why did Tay have to talk about something that was supposed to be in the past? 



In the present, my friends and I hang out a lot, and some of them have even talked to me about some of Tay’s career plans and their current state, since they have talked to Tay due to going to their same school. Said friends seem to wonder why Tay cannot hang out with us when we plan our gatherings, since Tay always seems enthusiastic about a potential hang out when my friends mention it. I usually volunteer to plan the hang outs and inform Tay, though, so I don't have to actually invite Tay, because I don’t want Tay in my life anymore. I fell for two people who Tay rejected, and lost the second one due to Tay talking about the incident with the first one. AITAH for telling my friends Tay just does not want to hang out?

,AmItheAsshole,"Background: my wife and I have been together for 11 years, we moved from the UK to Australia 8 years ago, married 7 years ago, and have two kids aged 5 and 3. I am British, she is Australian, we moved Down Under mainly for her to be closer to her family but also because we thought it would be a nicer place to raise a family. Both of her parents have passed away, she has 2 sisters (with partners and kids) within a 20 minute drive who we see regularly, probably 2 or 3 times a month. Our marriage has had some ups and downs but we’re tried to work through things and I’ve spent a lot of time with her family (who I get on well with)
 
The issue we’re having is that we disagree on where to spend much of Christmas 2024. My wife would like to spend the morning at home with our family of 4, then at about 11am we’d drive for 2+ hours to her sister’s husband’s parent’s house because that is where both of her sisters will be. We’d spend the whole of the afternoon and evening there, before sleeping in a tent outside because there isn’t enough room in the house (there must be 20+ people attending including all of my brother-in-law’s family and their families).
 
I would like to spend the whole day at our own house and in our own home with the 4 of us, having our own intimate Christmas, rather than spending much of it driving and at my sister-in-law’s husband’s parent’s house. We did this years ago and I felt like an outsider, gatecrashing another family’s day (even though they were happy to have us).
 
In the 8 years that we have been in Australia, we have flown back to the UK once to spend it with my family out there. My mother has also flown out here once to be with me and her grandkids. On the other 7 occasions in Australia, so 7 times out of 8, we have spent lunch and the afternoon with all of her family, sisters, in-laws, their kids, aunties and uncles etc. This has either been at their houses down the road, hosted at our house, or that one time we went to the place which is being discussed.
 
I tried to compromise by saying that although I don’t want to spend some of Christmas in a car and with many people who we barely know, I’d rather spend it at home, why don’t we go there on the 26th or host a lunch the week before, or both. My wife doesn’t like any of these ideas and is upset, saying that I would be stopping her from being with her sisters, the kids would have fun being around their cousins, that I shouldn’t just get to decide and that I’m making this all about me.
 
Moving to the other side of the world, spending almost every Christmas with them, and seeing them all the time isn’t stopping her from seeing her sisters. I think it’s the opposite. Clearly we see Christmas very differently, but this year I would just like to spend the day with my immediate family and really have maximum special times with our kids, before next year we return to the usual rotation.

,AmItheAsshole,"I(24m) and my gf K(22f) have been dating for 3 years. We’ve discussed a future and planned out our timeline of our engagement and marriage. We agreed on our engagement to be before the end of the year. Unfortunately due to both her and I being military and being apart for half the year and only recently returning to our home state in August made things difficult. Fortunately I was able to do the right thing and get her parents blessings and then soon go ring shopping with K’s mom (D) and sister (A). We went to a big jewelry shop where we’re able to order the perfect engagement band for K. The ring would take about 2 weeks to get to the store. Last week the ring came in and I asked D and A if we could see the ring together on Saturday 10/25, as K won’t be home. A was working that day and wouldn’t be able to go, so it would be just me and D. I thought I had communicated that though I’d prefer if all three of us could go together, I wouldn’t mind if it were me and D. However,I found out that D and A didn’t know we still had planned to go. The miscommunication is my fault and I accept that I should of verified first long before the day in question. D asked if we could reschedule, but I didn’t want to potentially reschedule and push my plans back another week/month trying to coordinate with 3 different schedules. I have 2 months left to plan something and I imagined I’d be cutting it pretty close. So with that in mind I respectfully told D that tho I take responsibility for the miscommunication, I really can’t push my timeline anymore than I already have. Needless to say D was not pleased and told me “whatever, do what you want”. I backtracked and said I could just look at the band and buy the diamond and ask the jeweler to hold onto them until we all came together during the weekday after work to see it. She then proceeded to tell me “I don’t want to talk to you rn”. So at a loss as to what to do I went forward with my plans. I sent a text message to the both of them apologizing for the miscommunication and the hurt I caused. That I wanted to make it up to them and if there was anything I could do to make things right so we could continue with the remaining plans and make sure K has a wonderful proposal. Her mom responded by telling me, that I hurt their feelings, that even tho they were upset I decided to continue anyway. She said that there’s no moving forward from this and that I ruined it for her, that it breaks her heart that K probably won’t have a wonderful memory of her proposal, but that’s on me because I ruined it and I’ll have to live the rest of my life knowing that. Good luck with the proposal, I hope it's everything you selfishly hoped it would be. Needless to say I felt absolutely shitty for taking that part of the ring picking away from them. And looking back on it, I probably could have worked something out if I chose to reschedule. I’m not sure what to do next. So Reddit AITA? 

Hey all. Appreciate all the comments and insight. For clarification, I invited both D and A to be involved in picking out the ring, because I wanted to and knew it would be important to K and I. I already knew what K would want for the ring and when I went to go see that ring I knew immediately that she would love it. I didn’t really need D or A’s help too much just their thoughts and opinions, but that ultimately it was going to be my choice. K isn’t as dramatic as her mother and honestly is much more reasonable. She and I both know that her mother can be dramatic when wronged and I’m thinking that’s the case here.

,AmItheAsshole,"Hi I have 4 grandchildren. 2 are same age girls 3 and 2 are under 8 months to 2 different sons. My 3 year old got diagnosed 3 weeks ago and her parents broke up a few days later. They've had a volatile relationship nearly since the beginning of their 4 year marriage. His wife seems to be suffering mental health issues and we have offered help in the past so their family doesn't break up. She doesn't seem to like any of my family so we are actually happy as it was starting to affect their 3 year old where if she was at my house and anyone was screaming or arguing she would cover her ears and climb under the dining table. So yes we don't want them back together. They have an 8 month old and the 3 year old. The 3 year old has just been diagnosed with Leukaemia. I have been trying to help with both kids with them sleeping at mine or sometimes me in the hospital with the 3 year old. My issue is this AIAH for not ignoring but just somehow don't have the time to see them for the last 3 weeks ( I am also a carer for my old mum, sister who lives with her and is intelectually disabled, she is intelectually 1 years old, and a 13 year old teenager who lives with them who lived with my mum and dad since 2 years of age but my dad died 5 years ago. There are also big problems with him that I have to deal with) I don't live with them but I go there everyday to cook, clean, take them shops and keep them company). For the last 3 weeks I have been going there but not for too long, doing just the important stuff so they are safe and ok but I've been also concentrating on my 3 year old gd. My oldest son (30) who has the other 3 year old and a 6 mth old baby had been complaining to me that I forgot I have other grand kids and I'm helping the ex so she can relax and what's the use when they are probably going to get back together anyway ( that would devestate us all as we know the kids are better in 2 happy homes than 1 ugly and angry home,) my older sons wife is also upset that I am IGNORING my  grandkids and the younger one is hitting milestones and I haven't seen any. My heart is broken when I get accused of all this especially when I just want my 3 year old gd to get back to good. This is going to be a 2 year process and I am already feeling like I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. My older son and wife are now making excuses when I find little bits of time in between to see them as they probably feel like well if you can't give your grandchildren proper time then you will get nothing. My other son doesn't know any of this as he would get upset as he feels same as me that for now there  is nothing more important than being there for my gd. I am run down but have to keep going and having the whole family support would even atleast mentally help me.

His wife seems to be suffering mental health issues and we have offered help in the past so their family doesn&amp;#39;t break up. She doesn&amp;#39;t seem to like any of my family so we are actually happy as it was starting to affect their 3 year old where if she was at my house and anyone was screaming or arguing she would cover her ears and climb under the dining table. So yes we don&amp;#39;t want them back together. They have an 8 month old and the 3 year old. The 3 year old has just been diagnosed with Leukaemia. I have been trying to help with both kids with them sleeping at mine or sometimes me in the hospital with the 3 year old. My issue is this AIAH for not ignoring but just somehow don&amp;#39;t have the time to see them for the last 3 weeks ( I am also a carer for my old mum, sister who lives with her and is intelectually disabled, she is intelectually 1 years old, and a 13 year old teenager who lives with them who lived with my mum and dad since 2 years of age but my dad died 5 years ago. There are also big problems with him that I have to deal with) I don&amp;#39;t live with them but I go there everyday to cook, clean, take them shops and keep them company). For the last 3 weeks I have been going there but not for too long, doing just the important stuff so they are safe and ok but I&amp;#39;ve been also concentrating on my 3 year old gd. My oldest son (30) who has the other 3 year old and a 6 mth old baby had been complaining to me that I forgot I have other grand kids and I&amp;#39;m helping the ex so she can relax and what&amp;#39;s the use when they are probably going to get back together anyway ( that would devestate us all as we know the kids are better in 2 happy homes than 1 ugly and angry home,) my older sons wife is also upset that I am IGNORING my  grandkids and the younger one is hitting milestones and I haven&amp;#39;t seen any. My heart is broken when I get accused of all this especially when I just want my 3 year old gd to get back to good. This is going to be a 2 year process and I am already feeling like I&amp;#39;m going to have a nervous breakdown. My older son and wife are now making excuses when I find little bits of time in between to see them as they probably feel like well if you can&amp;#39;t give your grandchildren proper time then you will get nothing. My other son doesn&amp;#39;t know any of this as he would get upset as he feels same as me that for now there  is nothing more important than being there for my gd. I am run down but have to keep going and having the whole family support would even atleast mentally help me. So AITA ?&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"I know this is very far away and maybe I'll change my mind but I genuinely don't think I will. 

I (16f) recently went to my uncle's wedding and it got me thinking about my own wedding and what I would do. 


I thought about who was walking me down the aisle and in my mind I decided that I would really like my mom to do it. 


Anyways, a few days ago I told my mom that I already had some of the things I would like in my wedding planned even tho it's very far away. 
And one of those things was for her to walk me down the aisle. Now I told this to her in the kitchen, I didn't know my dad was in the diner listening to my conversation and he overheard this and got upset and asked me why I don't want him to walk me down the aisle. 


I have a whole [post that explains some of the things he does](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/MvtnHQvikE) that might give you an insight to why I would rather have my mom walk me down the aisle. 

I told him that while I do love him, and of course he will be at my wedding, the person who walks you down the aisle is supposed to be the person who was there for you, who took care of you, who loved you the most and protected you, and is now ""setting you free"" to another person to start your new family with another person you love, and that person is my mom, she has always looked out for me, she always wants to be spending time with me, she always takes care of me, she has conversations with me, she asked me about my day, she knows me, which is specially important to me because for example, my dad knows that maybe I like some music, like for example my favorite band is my chemical romance, but not because he has asked me;
 he knows it because I blast it at full volume in my Alexa. 

But he doesn't know my friends, doesn't know about things that happened to me with them, that happened to them in school; because he doesn't ask how my day was, he doesn't ask if something happened, he doesn't ask anything, anyways, the whole explanation is in my other post 

So I think I would really like my mom to walk me down the aisle because she is the person who has looked out for me my whole life, but now I'm feeling a little bad that I told him to his face that I would rather have my mom with me down the aisle even though he has many things to me.

My husband (32M) was at the hospital at the beginning but had to take our kid home and came back to pick me up once I was cleared. 

Here's the issue: after not alot of sleep , still woke up to take our kid to school, noticed he was still home and he told me he was not feeling well(sore throat, congestion etc) I made him some  breakfast and hot tea and took my kid to school. I came home and took my first round of meds and went back to sleep. I woke up around noon, still not feeling to great so I  ate took my second round of meds checked to see if he had a fever while sleeping  and picked up the kitchen a bit. Around 230pm I woke him up and asked him if he could take me to pick up our kid and pick up more meds (if I have the option to not drive it's easier then to  drive because my belly hits the steering wheel and is uncomfortable) and that he should drink some water and eat something. He agrees but looks visibly upset and continues to look upset throughout the time.

We get home I ask him what's wrong and he says ""I do not care about him because I couldn't even get him water when he was sick"" I am confused because I'm still trying to take care of myself after the hospital, so i told him i can only do  what I could do in the mean time (make breakfast while he was awake ) I asked if he wanted any other help and said he'd do it on his own because once again I do not care. At this point I'm getting upset because he knows the issues I've been having and realistically I dont want to risk getting sick myself,  but he said it wasn't a issue since we rode in the car together (fully masked). He then began yelling at me that I never return the same amount of care for something as simple as waking him up to take meds and give him water.

I'm confused on if I AITA or not because if circumstances were different I wouldn't mind taking more care but I'm just not physically or in the mental space to keep taking care for others while my health in pregnancy is declining.

He agrees but looks visibly upset and continues to look upset throughout the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get home I ask him what&amp;#39;s wrong and he says &amp;quot;I do not care about him because I couldn&amp;#39;t even get him water when he was sick&amp;quot; I am confused because I&amp;#39;m still trying to take care of myself after the hospital, so i told him i can only do  what I could do in the mean time (make breakfast while he was awake ) I asked if he wanted any other help and said he&amp;#39;d do it on his own because once again I do not care. At this point I&amp;#39;m getting upset because he knows the issues I&amp;#39;ve been having and realistically I dont want to risk getting sick myself,  but he said it wasn&amp;#39;t a issue since we rode in the car together (fully masked). He then began yelling at me that I never return the same amount of care for something as simple as waking him up to take meds and give him water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m confused on if I AITA or not because if circumstances were different I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind taking more care but I&amp;#39;m just not physically or in the mental space to keep taking care for others while my health in pregnancy is declining. I feel bad that he has a cold but even the arguing raised my blood pressure to almost the point of having to go back to the hospital.  So AITA for not helping more with my husband&amp;#39;s cold?&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"Context:
It was around 8PM and dark outside. I was about 20 meters from the right turn (no stop sign) to get onto my street. As I approach the turn I see a kid who seemed to be about 10 biking and her mom walking behind her (both not wearing any reflective clothing).  I turn on my right turn signal quite early to tell them I'm turning.

I slow down considerably to about 15-20 km/ h, as I always do because I know there are a lot of kids in my neighbourhood. As I'm turning the kid seems to be speeding up/catching up because I was going quite slow to be respectful.

After completing the turn I see the mom taking a picture of my license plate so I get out of my car and ask her why she did that. I didn't quite hear what she said but it was something along the lines of her kid biking and how me turning there was rude and that I'd be hearing from her tomorrow.
In response I told her that I slowed down considerably indicated I was turning long before and that she as a parent should be more aware of her child.

My thoughts on the situation:
I felt like I was driving super safely and made sure to give them plenty of room while I passed them.

Usually parents will tell their kids to stop biking and pull them to the side as a car passes. In this case the mom in my opinion was being extremely irresponsible.

,AmItheAsshole,"Hey Reddit, 24-year-old male here. Alright story time, so I and my college best friend 20 female have been super close friends for almost 5 years even dated in between. Now to the juice, during these 5 years together I myself work a very profitable job and have been able to afford the nicer things in life while my best friend unfortunately has not. So being a gift giver at heart, 3 years into our relationship with one another I gifted her with a car. It was a used Lexus,  I gave this gift out of appreciation and love for her but also for safety. I will explain here in a bit as to why. Now to the parents, her parents have always been nice in a social sense but I have always felt they never had good intentions with their daughter in mind, especially with money. In the past, for context, the parents were poor at one point due to a gambling problem which has since affected them. It also doesn't help that one of the parents, father in particular doesn't work. Now my best friend still lives with her parents at home but her parents every month charge her money for rent, YES rent! Now yes it is nowhere near what rent prices are to this day but it is still a hefty sum of $1100 dollars every month. On top of that, she also has to pay insurance on her own to them which they charge a premium on as well. Lastly, they have complete access to her bank accounts. Okay, so when I purchased the Lexus for her I bought it as a gift as well as a safety thing. Why safety? Well, the reason is that she was driving around 1993 Saturn with no working airbags and ONE functional headlight. Now this Saturn was never purchased for her, it was given by the uncle. Now she had complained to her parents she wanted a new car but in return what they ended up doing was buying the mom a brand new SUV instead. So being a loving boyfriend and friend at the time I surprised her with a car. Now she had this car and had loved it for almost a year and a half until that brings us to today. just a few days ago she got into a car accident( her fault ) now as I arrived at the scene I came to find out the parents (behind her back) had lowered her coverage in secret from full coverage to liability only leaving her with a totaled car. Now I was a bit upset, not only because the gift I gave her was destroyed but because her parents would do something so sly behind her back just so they could pocket the extra money she was giving every month. (This insurance change was made 4 months ago). Now Reddit here is where I feel like the asshole, after the accident I had offered for her to drive my Porsche because she had a long commute and no car but she kindly declined. So I offered to get her another car, only for her to tell me she needed to consult her parents.

,AmItheAsshole,"This is going to be a long one, so get your popcorn!

It all started when I met my friend Gina a couple of years ago, and we became close. After about a year, she introduced me to her boyfriend, Jason. My fiancé and I were excited to have another couple friend. 

As we got to know Jason, we noticed he was often tired and would fall asleep when we hung out. He worked at his family’s office supply business, putting in long hours from 6 AM to 5 PM, plus a part-time job afterward. It became clear he didn’t have a grasp on work-life balance, as he lived at home with his family and worked with them. Jason was raised in a traditional environment that emphasized getting married and having kids, and he had never vacationed without his family. 

One issue arose during a conversation about having kids. I expressed that I wasn't ready for children, and afterward, my fiancé revealed that Jason texted him, suggesting he should hurry up and get me pregnant before I “expire.” I tried to keep the peace and didn't confront Jason about the message because whenever we disagreed with him about opinions in the past, he became defensive and shut down our opinions.

Things escalated during our joint bachelor and bachelorette trip to NYC (it was only the 4 on the trip). Jason turned out to be a buzzkill, wanting to avoid touristy activities and insisting on going to bed by 9 PM. One night, we went to a nightclub (which we all agreed about going to), and he made Gina go to bed with him at 9PM. After he fell asleep, she joined us around midnight, but afterward, Jason wouldn’t let her do anything else after 9 PM for the rest of the trip. 

I began to resent Jason for ruining the trip and my fiancé's experience at his bachelor party. It felt like I had to pick up the slack to ensure my fiancé had a good time, balancing my own bachelorette activities while also trying to cater to Jason's preferences. He was particular about timing, insisting we arrive early for reservations, which created tension. I wanted to enjoy my bachelorette party, but it felt like we were hanging out with a dad.

On our wedding day, tensions continued as Jason seemed upset that my fiancé wasn’t giving him sole attention. He noticed I was quieter and not engaging with him, leading him to bombard my fiancé with messages about why I hated him and didn’t want to be friends after the wedding. This wasn’t true; I was just trying to maintain peace in our friend group. 

After Jason confronted my fiancé, I decided to send him a message explaining my feelings about the NYC trip and how he often shut down my opinions. I wanted to move past any resentment and promised to be more engaged in our conversations. He never responded to my message and now Gina no longer talks to me. She lives with Jason and his parents, works with him at the family business, and recently sold her car to share one with him. 

Now I just feel upset and hurt that Gina could so easily end our friendship even though I was trying to keep the peace and move on from what happened in the past.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (20M) know how the title sounds so I'm going to try my best to give context and expand on what I mean.

I'm on a vacation with three other friends. I've been friends everyone in this group for at least 1-2 years. Although we are all ethnically Chinese, I'm the only one who can't speak Mandarin fluently (though I can speak/understand Cantonese, a different dialect). Our default mode of communication is English; English is my first language since I grew in the west. As for 2 of the other 3, it's their second language, but they're still proficient enough in it to communicate on a day-to-day basis.

We're flying to a few different cities over 12 days. The first few days in our first destination were normal, until we were flying to the next city. I booked a slightly later flight so I'd be landing an hour after them. When I met up with them again, I noticed they were conversing almost exclusively in Mandarin (except when using nouns there are no direct translations for, like companies, names, etc.)

I wasn't that bothered at first because I thought it was just a personal conversation, but it continued even after the drive from the airport.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m on a vacation with three other friends. I&amp;#39;ve been friends everyone in this group for at least 1-2 years. Although we are all ethnically Chinese, I&amp;#39;m the only one who can&amp;#39;t speak Mandarin fluently (though I can speak/understand Cantonese, a different dialect). Our default mode of communication is English; English is my first language since I grew in the west. As for 2 of the other 3, it&amp;#39;s their second language, but they&amp;#39;re still proficient enough in it to communicate on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re flying to a few different cities over 12 days. The first few days in our first destination were normal, until we were flying to the next city. I booked a slightly later flight so I&amp;#39;d be landing an hour after them. When I met up with them again, I noticed they were conversing almost exclusively in Mandarin (except when using nouns there are no direct translations for, like companies, names, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t that bothered at first because I thought it was just a personal conversation, but it continued even after the drive from the airport.

This was surprising because we'd been in mostly regular contact, and I hadn't been socializing much outside of our friendship due to being in school. 

The bigger shock came when I learned that Steph had found a new house but hadn't told me. This isn't the first time she's kept significant news from me. In high school, she didn't tell me about getting a car or getting a kitten, even though I'd expressed concerns.

A few days ago, I congratulated her on finding the house, and she denied it. I've been avoiding her since.

,AmItheAsshole,"Hey Reddit friends, new to Reddit- need advice. Family and friends will always have my back so I need some solid opinions. 

I (35F) bought my apartment 3 years ago. Since the day I moved in my downstairs neighbor (67M) has found many things to complain about when he sees me. It began with me installing hardwood floors from carpet that’s been there since the 80s. It was gross but great noise suppression. 

Then it was my old sliding glass door. Every time I opened it he said “it sounded like a freight train going through his house.” So I replaced it.

Then it was my windows. He said they’re causing a leak into his windows… so I replaced them. He still had the leak…

And the list goes on. Typically when he complains I just stare at him. He can talk incessantly. I pick and choose what is reasonable for me to address. I’m not a petty person or confrontational. 

Now here is the latest… I adopted a dog a year ago. He is a Boston terrier (15lbs). He does not bark much but he does love to play with his ball. Due to my work commute, I am only home from 7pm to 7am Monday through Friday. My dog goes to a doggy day care (AKA my parents). When we get home, we take a half hour walk and then he plays for a half hour (max) and goes to bed at 8pm like clockwork. He’s literally sleeping right now. On the weekends we’re home mainly only until 10am and back home at 9pm. I’m always out and about. But if anything the weekend is the period of the week my dog’s running drives my neighbor nuts. But even on these days my dog plays for half hour spurts, sleeps for four hours, plays, sleeps, etc. 

This past Saturday, we just came in from a walk. My dog ran in, started playing with his ball… I was sitting on my couch when I heard “WHAT THE F*** ARE YOU DOING UP THERE?” Along with a few more obscenities. 

My dog stopped what he was doing (LOL) looked at me and went to his bed to lay down. I of course was shocked… but also went on with my day. But now I’m not even sure how to address him when I see him. 

My family and friends say “he shouldn’t buy an apartment downstairs if he can’t ignore noise…” 

So I need some unbiased opinions…AITA?

,AmItheAsshole,"Ok, so, basically what it says on the tin, but...

Today is my(18nb) sister's(20f) birthday. We'll call her Star. I sent her a happy birthday text and am going to buy her dinner at some point. Me and star currently live on different sides of the country, because of university, but we text all the time, so we're very close.

I had a GP appointment today because I was having some pain and wanted meds, and long story short but I ended up in hospital because of it. I have never been in hospital by myself and I have a bit of a phobia, so I texted my dad (53m) and my mum (47f) separately to see if they were free to come and be with me at some point. My dad wasn't, but mum was. I chose not to tell star, because A, she was six hours away, B, there was no emergency happening, and C, it's her birthday and I didn't want her to be worried about me when there was nothing she could do about it.

Later, while still in hospital and having been there for several hours at this point, I get a text from Star asking why I didn't tell her that I was in hospital. I texted her back and said that I didn't want her to be worried about me. Then I texted my dad and asked him why he told her (I knew it wasnt my mum because she was sat next to me all day). He basically said that because we're all family he has a right to tell her.

I got a bit angry at that and told him that he had no right to go telling people my personal information, and that he and I have been over this before (he has a habit of telling people things about me which end up embarrassing/on one occasion outing me). He said he thought I was overreacting, and I got mad and ignored the rest of his messages, only texting him again when I got home to let him know I was ok, which he was pretty angry about (that I'd ignored him, obviously he was happy I was fine).

At that point i was like wtf, so this is where it all started, i texted Cindy asking ""why did you tell Linda's boyfriend i kissed you?"" she sent a snap saying ""girl i didn't what r u on?"" i said that i was just asking because i didn't want to assume what George was correct this is the part that i don't think i'm in the wrong, she then got Linda to talk for her because she was mad she said she was mad at me because i had ""Assumed"" that it was her, I got home an saw the dump truck sized notification list on my phone, i looked them all over and she basically went on a tangent about how i assumed that she said that and how i was an a-hole for assuming. i then sent her a text along the lines of, ""girl calm down i was asking if you did not accusing you"" she then got even more mad saying that i had just assumed and that she had proof and i was being childish because i wasn't answering the phone i told her why and she said that i had earbuds for a reason and that i was being immature for not talking about it she then said, ""You know what were going to stop talking about this from now on were just going to move on and never talk about this again"" i then said , ""no we need to have a conversation about this."" as well as apologizing for wording it wrong several times. and she told me not to text her for the res of the day, and to ""f\*ck off"" i then sadly replied ""you know what f\*ck you to"" to which she replied and i quote be cause i took screen shots, ""f\*ck you you dumb\*ss b\*tch you can go f\*ck yourself and go live your life with your imagination boyfriend f\*ck you c\*nt"" i then proceeded to block her.

Then she got mad got in a group chat on snap chat we had with another friend that doesn't really like Cindy and i told her she was being petty and she said again ""f\*ck you"" and after a bit of back and forth and another bad thing i did i gave her an ultimatum, i said that this wasn't something we could just ""never talk about again"" i said i was sorry for my part in the situation and that she could either add me back or make another gc with me or she could do nothing and basically i would cut her out of my life from then on. and that's where i am its been a day since the incident and she did reluctantly make a gc and i said "" i'm not going to talk here for several days so that we can both cool down"" so AITAH",t2_xfd3c2dd8,False,,0,False,AITA for asking why my friend told someone we kissed?,[],r/AmItheAsshole,False,7,not,0,,False,t3_1gegtiy,False,light,0.42,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Not the A-hole,False,0,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,2024-10-28 23:42:43,text,7,,,text,self.AmItheAsshole,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I (15M) and my friend who we&amp;#39;ll call Cindy (16F) went to HOCO a few days ago. for context I am gay and openly so, she is Pan but not out to anyone else, she is also dating someone. we went as friends because I don&amp;#39;t have a partner right now. we had lots of fun and stayed the whole time.

This years theme is Barbie (any Barbie movie that there is) and my wife decided we would do Princess Charm School since it was her favorite Barbie movie growing up.
I hate this theme and would rather go as something more manly that won't embarrass me in front of my neighbors and friends. After work one night I stopped at the store and got myself a Batman costume instead. I let my wife believe I was going as Barbie's love interest from the movie and would arrive later to the party because I was working late, when in all reality I was getting ready to wear the Batman costume.
When I arrived at the party my wife's sisters happened to meet me by the door and got mad a me for wearing this costume. I explained that I didn't like the theme so I chose my own. At that point my wife had found us and started yelling about how selfish I was and how this is the one time a year that she gets to let loose and have fun with the theme. She told me to leave and I drove to a friends house and am spending the night out of anger.
All of her family is blowing up my phone telling me how selfish I am and calling me every name in the book. I blocked them and told my wife I needed a couple days to cool down. 

As I thought about it more, I can see how I was being a little selfish and should have stuck with the theme. But, I don't think I'm the A-hole for sticking to my own beliefs and having free will in this relationship. Reddit AITA?

I started off by saying ""I'm sorry if this is rude, but your daughter hasn't been helping me at all and her boyfriend is here almost every night when you and my dad leave.""

Or so my mother says. Because after scare #2, she made it her life’s mission to convince my dad to stop watching football.

,AmItheAsshole,"Hi everyone, 

so I will just ask AITA for leaving my birthday party my mom organised?   
So first of all I’m gonna provide some context because it really is necessary. I (F18) recently had My 18th birthday (I am from Europe, Germany specifically, so they are a big thing here).

The last family birthdays always ended up with family drama and me crying or even worse having a complete breakdown. So I guess you can say I am everything but not a fan of birthdays, especially not mine. So when I was around 15 I decided I would not celebrate my birthday in any form.   
I don’t expect gifts, calls or messages and I will never be mad if someone forgets my birthday because I don’t really share the date either. 

It worked well for my 16th and 17th birthday. My mom and I toasted, my dad and grandparents gave me a call. I got some presents and was grateful for them. But then my 18th birthday rolled around.  
I was already in a bit of a pissy mood on the days leading up to it because my mom made a huge fuss about everything I have to pay her now (rent, groceries, utilities ect.) and she was constantly nagging at me that it is rude not to celebrate my birthday at all.

Well I clearly said, multiple times a day, that I just was not interested in having to celebrate. I don’t expect gifts and everyone who feels the need to congratulate me can simply call because hey; cellphones do exist.

Well I think you can already guess what happened. I woke up around 11 am by a screeching sound I knew all too well our doorbell. I don’t know how the hell it happened but my grandparents stood in my room. And then my mum. With huge balloons and decoration ready. I was still kind of in a delirium but anyway.

An hour later I went out with a former very close friend of mine because she asked me. We had brunch and then I went brought her home with me because she needed to grab some things. Well guess what? Around 20 people in our living room screaming a mix of “surprise” und “happy birthday”.

20. Fucking. People. Obviously I was incredibly overwhelmed because a) I am not a people’s person and b) why is there a birthday party? I thanked everyone and took my mom aside to ask her what was going on. I mean I had my suspicions but I didn’t think that she would simply ignore every wish But surprise surprise she did.

Well I went on with this charade for about 3 hours and then it became a bit too much for me. So I told my mom I would be leaving. And I did. I told my relatives I had other plans because I obviously didn’t know what was happening and they all showed understanding. None of them were mad at me in any way.

I returned in the evening and boy was my mom pissed. She went on a whole rant of how disrespectful I was and that everyone was so disappointed yadda yadda yadda. Well I left again. Drive to my dad‘s apartment and stayed there. Now every time this comes up in a conversation I get called an asshole for leaving and not respect her wish that I stay for my birthday party.

My business partner and I run a bar together. I have family money, so I did it for the fun of it. He's legally the owner, and I just help manage things. I loved working in the kitchen, designing the menu, decor, etc. He handles the business side of things and the bar. This arrangement worked for us for several years. We are close friends as well as business partners, and he's become like a surrogate brother to me.

Anyway---I lost my aunt about a year ago in a very traumatic way, and I was devastated about it. She was like a mother to me, and losing her destroyed me. I didn't want to be anyplace that reminded me of her, including the town we are from. My boyfriend has a home on the other side of the country, so I went there with him and spent a few months just dissociating and processing my grief. I didn't communicate with anyone for awhile, either---I just wanted to disappear until I felt better. I was in the darkest place I've ever been in my life, and honestly just felt like a zombie.

He has abandonment issues, which I think is why he's reacting so strongly about this. I didn't mean to trigger that, I was just trying to heal myself. And yes, I understand that not everyone has the financial luxury of vanishing for an extended amount of time, but it was what I needed to grieve.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (18F) am the youngest in my close family circle so far. Now, my family always holds gatherings to my grandma's house once or twice a year depending on the circumstances. Obviously, I attended every single one, except from when I was feeling sick.

My cousins (and older sister) would always play board games or talk about various topics. However, I would always be purposely excluded from everything. Whenever I asked to play, they would come up with the excuse “We have already started. You can play in the next round.” When the next round would come, my cousins would just get up and leave me alone with the game. Something similar went with the conversations.

I would often sit in a corner or, when I was allowed, I would get my mother's phone and play or watch something. As you can imagine, the gatherings were boring experiences. The only good thing about them was the food. (Grandma's food never disappointed)

That ruined my relationship with my cousins and aunts/uncles, but what gave the final blow was when at my 8th birthday, I had my first party. I didn't have many friends, so I invited my cousins. To no one's surprise, I was once again ignored by everyone. It got so bad to the point I had to lock myself in my parents' bedroom.

In present time, I was asked by my mother to attend the family gathering this year. I refused, telling her that I never had a good relationship with my cousins and I do not wish to be ignored AGAIN. She was a bit bitter, but she didn't pressure me.

When she returned home a few hours ago, she started yelling at me and how I am ‘selfish’ for refusing to attend the gathering. She said that she ‘covered my ass’, in her words, by telling everyone that I was sick.

She also went as far as to say that I disappointed my grandma and I don't care about her. (That's not true. I adore her but I physically and mentally can't stand my cousins anymore.)

,AmItheAsshole,"My fiancé (34M) and I (33F) have been together for 6 years, engaged for 5 years. We both live in a different country than our country of origin.
These 6 years have been full of financial hardships and just recently we started getting back on track. That is why we never got to get married the proper way.
Note: our families don't have money. Both sides have modest lives. Nothing is missing, they have enough to be comfortable, no debt, but no great savings either, just enough in case something happens.
Back to the story: we are planning to conceive and after all the math and accounting, we realized that a proper wedding is not possible in the near future. We both believe that it's more important to have our finances free of debt and available for everything home, pregnancy and (hopefully) baby related.
We have talked to our families a couple of months ago and told them we plan to have a civil ceremony soon, just to have the paperwork done and plan a proper wedding for the future. Both sides were happy to hear that and were accepting of the ""wedding in the future"" part.
After those talks, my fiancé and I started planning.
Fast forward to tonight: I was talking to my parents and I told them we have everything ready, we just need to make an appointment with an officiant and sign the papers (this could potentially happen in December if all goes well).
That's when everything went south: my mom started crying, saying how can we do this to them, how can she accept that her daughter is getting married and she wouldn't be present, how can we just exclude them entirely and more.
I didn't really react, I listened to her and tried to calm her down, but it took me by surprise because... we talked about this. I told them we are doing this and they seemed OK with what we decided. I still don't know how to take her reaction... I swear I was upfront, I didn't leave things to be misinterpreted.
I let her say everything she had to say, I told her I thought she understood when we talked that this is our plan. I also told her that this paper is nothing more than a formality that we want to do to have everything in order, in all the legal aspects, because we live as immigrants and CANNOT AFFORD to have any loose ends. If anything were to happen to any of us, good or bad, as immigrants we have it 10x more complicated, we cannot afford the risks.
After saying this, I told her that I will hang up because I need to think things through and sit with what happened.
I will also say that my father was there for the conversation, but didn't say anything. He is a man of few words anyway, but, by his reaction, he gave me the impression that he knew this was to happen and had no problem with it, but didn't want to confront my mom with me there. I don't really know, but I feel like he will tell her off when they are alone and they can talk freely. That's how he always did things, privately.

We have talked to our families a couple of months ago and told them we plan to have a civil ceremony soon, just to have the paperwork done and plan a proper wedding for the future. Both sides were happy to hear that and were accepting of the &amp;quot;wedding in the future&amp;quot; part.
After those talks, my fiancé and I started planning.
Fast forward to tonight: I was talking to my parents and I told them we have everything ready, we just need to make an appointment with an officiant and sign the papers (this could potentially happen in December if all goes well).
That&amp;#39;s when everything went south: my mom started crying, saying how can we do this to them, how can she accept that her daughter is getting married and she wouldn&amp;#39;t be present, how can we just exclude them entirely and more.
I didn&amp;#39;t really react, I listened to her and tried to calm her down, but it took me by surprise because... we talked about this. I told them we are doing this and they seemed OK with what we decided. I still don&amp;#39;t know how to take her reaction... I swear I was upfront, I didn&amp;#39;t leave things to be misinterpreted.
I let her say everything she had to say, I told her I thought she understood when we talked that this is our plan. I also told her that this paper is nothing more than a formality that we want to do to have everything in order, in all the legal aspects, because we live as immigrants and CANNOT AFFORD to have any loose ends. If anything were to happen to any of us, good or bad, as immigrants we have it 10x more complicated, we cannot afford the risks.
After saying this, I told her that I will hang up because I need to think things through and sit with what happened.
I will also say that my father was there for the conversation, but didn&amp;#39;t say anything. He is a man of few words anyway, but, by his reaction, he gave me the impression that he knew this was to happen and had no problem with it, but didn&amp;#39;t want to confront my mom with me there. I don&amp;#39;t really know, but I feel like he will tell her off when they are alone and they can talk freely. That&amp;#39;s how he always did things, privately.
I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"Am I being taking advantage of ?

I thought I was close friends with my boss, but things have been feeling off and frustrating lately.

It’s starting to feel like everything I do for her, she wouldn’t do for me in return.

She recently decided to move 30 hours away from where she currently lives. Originally, she invited me on a “vacation,” but I didn’t realize it was actually to help her move until she asked me to help her pack. I told her I was kind of broke because I’d been dealing with personal issues, but she said she’d cover my flight home and expenses.

So, after work, I helped her pack until around 3 a.m., and we left the next morning at 6 a.m. on our 30-hour journey. It took us two days, and she didn’t want to stop for anything except gas or sleep. No breaks for pictures, food stops—just gas stations.

Now we’re here, but it doesn’t feel like a vacation at all. I’m mostly sitting around the house or following her when she wants to go somewhere.

It’s Monday, and with everything going on, I hadn’t even thought about bills—my phone got shut off. I need to get back to work, but my boss promised to approve my PTO so I could access DailyPay, yet she hasn’t done it. I ended up asking my boyfriend to cover my bills and promised to make it up later.

I told her, “Hey, I really need to get home and work,” and she responded, “Well, you could’ve booked your flight.” In my head, I’m thinking, weren’t you going to pay for it? But she stayed silent when it came time to pay, so I had to call my boyfriend again to cover it.

Now my boyfriend’s upset, feeling like she’s taking advantage of me, and I’m frustrated. She even suggested we go get our nails done with her mother-in-law, but I declined. At this point, I’m worried she’ll expect me to pay for that too. The whole situation is just exhausting and disappointing.

Not to mention she still owes me from when her car got repossessed so I had to drive her around for like a week and the drive her to go get her car for like 6 hours there and back . 
I also lended her money cause she was short on paying the car people and she never paid me back to this day and that was like last month ……

There is me, Marc M29, Sarah F27 and Maria F21. 


Sarah and I work at University and Maria is a student. We are about to end our arrangement of sharing a flat because Sarah has financial troubles. Not the irresponsible kind. Her Mother has gotten sick very seriously and their insurance does not cover all of it. She has pledged to help her family and is moving back into her home town to save rent. We are living in the city and rents are just crazy here. That's why we share an apartment even with all of us working full jobs, well except Maria but her parents help her.


My own situation is that before I came to this city my grandmother passed away and left me a ton of furniture, kitchen supplies and some money. Not much. Like in the middle 4 digit area.

I am not very active in the kitchen, but my grandmas kitchen supplies are the foundation of our shared kitchen. We never had to buy anything because whatever one could use to cook a meal, she had at least one of them. But I prefer to eat at the Mensa at Uni as the meals are cheap and not half bad. I cook maybe twice a month and that's it. Sarah took that as an argument on why she would benefit more from these supplies as she cooks every dinner. Usually for herself but I never minded. It's what those are here for. I do not even have a problem with it, I just do not want to give them away for free. I am ofc not asking for high prices. I am asking like a buck for a plate, a buck for 10 pieces of cutlery or 5-10 for pots. She was very upset with that. With the idea of asking money in return because I so rarely use it and she needs it urgently. I offered to borrow these supplies to her for nothing in return except (jokingly) a hot meal and a bottle of beer when I come visit her the next time.

Also, co-host was in charge of food; myself and mom-2-be wanted to go with cheaper option, however, she insisted on going with more spendy caterer and told me it was because she thought he was attractive/wanted to flirt with him. (More inexpensive food would have been $250 cheaper)

,AmItheAsshole,"Throw away account due to the nature of the ask. 

For background, my wife and I have 1 kid who is over 3. Wife is a teacher. We have our second due in the new year. I’m fortunate enough to have a job that allows me to work from home and only have to go to the office once a quarter as the main office is located down London way. I took this job about 18 months ago as my previous job was causing me to work 70 hour weeks and I was burning out. A serious lack of home/life balance. 

Wife has decided to go on holiday this week with her side of the family, which was planned since the summer. Originally I said if I could make it down I would, but as it’s UK half term there would be others more senior to me already off and if I do come down, I will  still need to work. No issues with that at the time. 

Fast forward to the week of the holiday and I’m being pestered to come down, and despite me being upfront last week with how busy I am, and she knows how busy I am, she is disappointed in me not being able to make it. 

I’m the higher earner out of the two of us, and probably do the majority of the childcare through the week, cooking, shopping, house chores, being available to do things like be in for deliveries. It’s only when I need to nip down south for a few days this isn’t possible. When I don’t do the meals, it’s unlikely we actually have anything to eat as adults but she expects us to eat with the child to set good behaviours. 

In addition, I used to attend a running club Tuesday &amp; Thursday. I’ve since given that up so the wife could attend her female running group on a Tuesday, she now attends a pregnancy yoga on a Tuesday. I simply don’t have time now on a Thursday to attend as I’m having to sort the child’s food or catching up on work due to the commitments to the childcare.

As she is a teacher she is normally out of the house by 7am, back anywhere from 4pm to 6pm depending on the day. She takes Fridays off as part time to do childcare. But I’m still the one expected to do the meal prep on a Friday. 

Now as she’s said she is disappointed in me not able to commit to coming down for the family holiday, I responded saying well sure how about I give up my career, take a low paid office job and see how we get on. She didn’t overly like that answer of course.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (19F) have been close friends with Apple for 4 years, and we're part of a tight-knit group of 5 girls. Recently, though, Apple's behavior has really started bothering me.

For years, Apple has had a complicated relationship with a guy we'll call Tim. Their relationship was a lot of back and forth—sometimes she seemed attracted to him, other times she seemed repulsed. Meanwhile, Tim seemed pretty infatuated, asking her out numerous times over three years. There were moments where Apple seemed to lead him on, even using her dad as an excuse not to date him, which her dad even caught on to.

Tim finally got his chance with her, and they went on two dates last August. Then Tim went abroad for six months, and his style changed. Apple and Tim kept minimal contact, but she’s shown pictures of him to our group about ten times over the past year, usually to mock his appearance. At first, we laughed along since we all love Apple, but it started feeling wrong, especially since Tim’s a decent guy—quiet, kind, and respectful. Although his pushiness might’ve put Apple off, I still feel bad for him.

One incident stands out: Tim was hanging out with us, and as soon as he left to play sports, Apple began ridiculing him. I said, “Who needs enemies when you have friends like these?” but she just laughed it off. I’ve told her more directly how I feel a few times, but it didn’t seem to make much impact. About a week and a half ago, I spoke up again; she backed off for the day but brought it up once more three days ago. She was even showing Tim’s pictures to my sister’s friends at a party and making fun of him.

I don’t want Tim to cause a rift in our friendship, but I feel conflicted. I know I’m young and naive, and I could’ve been more forceful sooner, but I genuinely feel that this is wrong.

So I (24yo f) asked my bf of 3 years (29yo m) to come to my grandpas funeral. He doesn't believe in funerals or services so he refused. They I firmly told him that it was important for me, I also dont believe in it, or don't like it, but for me it was more of a support kinda thing, so I got angry bc I was very sensitive and told him that the least he could do was to be with me, and that he was being selfish. So he got mad that I thought he wasn't there for me, and told me I was forgetting every other time he was supportive. Then I explaied that it was more of a support thing and maybe he didn't knew what I needed from him, to be with me, and only thought I was forcing him into something he disliked. After that I asked him to only come to my house and say something to my parents and he stopped replying. The next day, the day of the funeral, he didn't answer my calls or texts. He completely ignored me. So apart from being sad for my family, I was confused about hos behavior. I'm thinking of dumping him because that was completely unnecessary and very rude.

,AmItheAsshole,"For context my sister had a ceremony then a wedding party, all planned on a Sunday. I was there for the entire religious ceremony and then the wedding party. I did show up about 20 mins late to the party since I was getting ready. However, my boyfriend and I had to leave early as we both wake up early in the morning and have very energy consuming jobs. 

He wakes up at 6 a.m. and I wake up at 6:30 a.m. I teach kids with autism which can be very taxing on my energy and I was set to work 10 hours the day after the wedding. My boyfriend also works construction. My sister and her husband don’t work much at all and my sister works from home at 10 hours a week compared to my 45. 

I did let my sister know beforehand that I may have to leave the wedding early as I wake up the next day to work two jobs back to back.  I don’t think she really took it in now looking at the way she reacted to us leaving early. My sister and the people who attended the wedding seemed to judge me for leaving earlier than everyone else. 

The issue is, I thought the pivotal moment would have happened earlier but the party started later than I anticipated (1 hour later) and for context, the food didn’t come out until 9:45 P.M. and my boyfriend and I were planning on leaving at 10:30. I felt really bad having to leave but it was really hard for me to be able to work such a long day without proper rest. Especially from being up from morning until night on Sunday helping my sister and family prep. 

 When my boyfriend and I went to say bye to everyone, it felt like most people were judging our decision to leave early and my sister refused to say bye to us. She gave us a dirty look and ignored us when we tried to say bye.

&lt;p&gt;The issue is, I thought the pivotal moment would have happened earlier but the party started later than I anticipated (1 hour later) and for context, the food didn’t come out until 9:45 P.M. and my boyfriend and I were planning on leaving at 10:30. I felt really bad having to leave but it was really hard for me to be able to work such a long day without proper rest. Especially from being up from morning until night on Sunday helping my sister and family prep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my boyfriend and I went to say bye to everyone, it felt like most people were judging our decision to leave early and my sister refused to say bye to us. She gave us a dirty look and ignored us when we tried to say bye. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, AITA? &lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"This sounds about as stupid as a feel about it. I am on leadership at a club at my university, and one of my jobs is taking care of the pet fish we keep at our space. I have spent a lot of time, money, and effort to keep this fish alive and I care maybe a little too much about it. 

Today I was on my way over to the house we use for club events (it is open anytime to those who meet certain requirements), and I got a text from my friend who was already there that there was a girl (we will call her Stacy) there putting breadcrumbs in the fish tank for the fish to eat. I was extremely upset by this, and I let Stacy know that when I got to the house. I was stern but not yelling, and she just laughed it off like I was overreacting and she didn’t just purposefully try and kill the fish. So I yelled. She laughed again. Then I left and cried to my mom because I was so frustrated. 

I ended up sending Stacy a long text telling her why I was angry and that I was over her doing whatever she wanted (she has a history of causing problems and pinning the blame on other people), and she did what she always does. She tried to make me believe I was being mean to her. She acted like she was the victim here and didn’t even acknowledge the fact that she might be in the wrong. We went back and forth for a bit before she accused me of being a bad friend to one of our other friends for bringing her into it (which I did apologize for), even though she did the exact same thing. She claimed she was “absolutely livid” that I would treat our other friend this way. That’s when I stopped answering. So AITA for this?

She also tried to text me telling me she didn’t do it even though she did say that’s she did in person.

,AmItheAsshole,"My parents took in my cousins after my aunt died 6 months ago. Jake is 12 and Riley turns 11 in a couple of days. Jake and Riley are half brothers. Their dads were arrested after my aunt died and so they can't each have custody of their kid. And it's looking like they might serve at least a couple of years each. So Jake and Riley will be with us at least as long. I'll hopefully be moved out by then.

Stuff was always really bad between them. Jake's dad left my aunt while she was pregnant but was still pissed she dated anyone after him. Riley's dad got pissy that Jake's dad was still around and broke up with my aunt because she wouldn't cut him out. Jake's dad hated Riley for wanting that and Riley's dad hated Jake for ""ruining everything"". I remember hearing stories of the two of them getting into fights. The boys matched that even though my aunt tried to create a loving bond between them. But they refuse to be called even half brothers, let alone brothers. They hate each other as much as their dads hate each other.

Life with them is hell and they're grieving which makes it worse. They don't want to live together but we're their only option. My parents keep hoping grief therapy will help them see each other as their link to my aunt and it will bring them closer.

Because of the fighting they can't be left unattended. Which is why babysitting is an issue. My parents want me to do it and I don't want to. My parents have to pull them apart a lot. That's not what I want to do with my free time. My parents have offered to pay me but really, unless they paid me like a crazy amount, it wouldn't be worth it because I would always have to be on guard.

They ruin each other's food, they break each other's stuff, they curse at each other, wish each other dead, they ruin each other's homework. Just all kinds of stuff. I believe they would be happy to have the other out of their life and I believe them when they say they'd be happy for the other to die.

My parents think I'm not doing what I should as a 16 year old who has a pretty good life otherwise. I would say I had until 6 months ago but now I try to not be home because of them.

,AmItheAsshole,"I moved into my current house about three years ago and have two indoor/outdoor cats. One of them spends most of his time outside, but we always make sure someone is home to let them in when they want to come inside. My neighbors had two outdoor cats who never went indoors. Living in Michigan, the winters can be harsh, and we’ve been feeding these cats since we’re unsure if they’re getting proper care.

One of the neighbor's cats went missing, and the other sustained serious injuries, including cuts and missing fur, but my neighbors didn’t take action to help. Despite our efforts, including providing a heated pad on our deck, and giving it deworming medicine that cat eventually passed away. Shortly after, my neighbors adopted two new kittens, and unfortunately, the same pattern is starting to emerge. These kittens live outside and often come to our door begging for food.

I feel a strong sense of responsibility for their well-being, and once I move in 1-2 years, I would like to take them with me. They are sweet and deserve a loving home.

So i decided to ask her if she could write me a card so she&amp;#39;s not excluded. and she responded with omg i totally forgot about your party. don&amp;#39;t worry ill give it to you on monday. It&amp;#39;s been 2 weeks since then. what should i do. i kinda wanna send the photo to the gc just to see what would happen, but would i be an asshole?&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"So me, my girlfriend(J), and 3 other friends moved in together (A,L,F), we've been living together since September 2023. Before moving in J organised everything to do with viewing multiple houses and going to the viewings with me, no one else did anything to help they just wanted to see the pictures from the viewings and say yes or no.

 When we finally found a house, me and J went looking for appliances that would be nice to have, we found a good set of microwave, airfryer and grill for £50 an hour and half away, we couldn't pass on the deal and asked everyone for £10 so that it could be a shared expense and everyone could use it whilst we're living there, so me and J went to go pick it up.

After living together after a couple of weeks F stopped cleaning up after herself leaving dirty dishes in the sink for days at a time to the point where we could not see the sink, at this point L and F were not friends so F came to me, J and A to talk about the mess F was making and wpuld talk shit behind her back. Fast forward a couple of weeks of this and suddenly L stops talking to me, J and A out of nowhere and starts being besties with F. So we call a flat meeting to see what's going on as there is unnecessary tension in the flat.

To our surprise L talks about how we make her uncomfortable for speaking bad behind F's back and that she's too mature for that kind of thing. We also addressed some other issues like the dishes and the fact that L keeps leaving the front door unlocked after going in or out of the flat without telling anyone so we'd go to sleep with the door unlocked (we live in the middle of the city due to being at uni).

Fast forward to present day, another flat meeting is called by L, she tells us that her and her boyfriend bought a house and she will be moving out in January. Me and J are also planning to move out after the new year because we've had enough of L and F, so we told them our plan and they start shouting at us saying ""thanks for telling us"" and so on. We also mentioned that we will be taking everything we bought for the flat for our new house, which would be basically 50% of the things in the living room and kitchen as no one else chipped in. F then starts arguing for the fact that she wants her £10 back for the appliances after using them for almost 2 years, me and J refused and said we went to go pick them up and we found them and everyone has used them loads so you had your £10 worth of use. She then started saying that taking everything that's communal is unfair and F and A should be left some things (even though only me and J paid for them). A already knew about us looking to move out and she was perfectly okay with everything that we said we would be taking as she's made arrangements to move back to her parents house after me and J move out as she's had enough of L and F too.

,AmItheAsshole,"Tl:dr: Mum has been driving high daily since her partner passed, including getting high with my younger siblings who both have Psychotic based mental illnesses and were both sectioned the last time she enabled them to smoke weed. I called her out and all hell has broken loose. 

My Step Dad (mum's partner) passed a couple of months ago. Since then she has been visiting my younger sibling and smoking Cannabis with them, and a significant amount at that, then driving home high. She has had some minor accidents driving home but left them all unreported (all empty cars). 

Tonight she came home so high she was slurring her words and genuinely ridiculously out of it. I sent her a huge rambling message pointing out the problems in her behaviour. 

This included the following points:

1. She is risking lives of others by driving high
2. She is risking sibling she is smoking with as she was sectioned for Psychosis last time she smoked it and lost custody of her daughter as a result
3. Risking OTHER sibling that lives with us as he is Schizophrenic and when she last enabled him to smoke it he was also sectioned
4. That I'm currently undergoing immunotherapy which causes me significant nausea, migraines etc and the pungent smell on her is making me feel much worse
5. That she was at least partly responsible for younger siblings both being sectioned previously due to same actions 
6. That I had to raise younger sibling when I myself was a child (I'm a decade older) because she spent all her time alone in her room getting high and I had to pick up the slack and I find it triggering she is being selfish again in similar way (she had quit for the past few years up until partner's recent passing)
7. Generally her actions are selfish and her late partner would be disappointed she's risking people's lives and health 
8. That we currently have a child family member staying with us and they shouldn't have to witness their grandparent acting so visibly ""weird"" 

Now, I know it was probably a bit passive aggressive to send this in a text rather than talk in person, but usually she will literally throw a tantrum if I do anything she dislikes in person. 

But anyway, she still kicked off, trashing the house and scaring our pets and the kid living with us. 

Now, I live with her but that is purely because my sibling that lives at home (Schizophrenic) has very high care needs and I am his sole carer. I wish I could leave but unfortunately doing so would risk his life, and I am not selfish enough to do that.

,AmItheAsshole,"Hi all, I have a really strange situation I’m hoping to get a neutral third party perspective on. 
My husband, toddler and I currently live with my MIL. We also have another baby on the way. We all rent a house together and she relies on our portion of rent to live here. She has the master bedroom, only garage space, has decorated the entire house to her liking, takes up 99% of kitchen storage space, and has her own office. My husband, daughter, and I occupy less than 500 sq feet of space between the three of us. My husband and I have a tiny bedroom that barely fits a queen bed. My daughter has her own room. We have an unattached bathroom. We also have a cat and dog. The cat has to live in our room and is not allowed to free roam as he may scratch her furniture. She also has a dog, and that has been an issue as well. Her dog is a 90+ pound pitbull that regularly gets “too excited” and knocks our daughter over and won’t stop kissing her. She has hit her head badly from this several times and I am concerned for her safety. The dog also begs for food anytime someone is eating and will jump up to grab food off my daughter’s high chair tray. Very little accountability has been taken to train the dog or acknowledge its behavior other than putting it in its crate. In fact, our dog is often blamed for this behavior because he barks which “gets the dog going”. 
Here’s my issue: clearly this living situation no longer feels suitable. We already don’t have enough space with my toddler and we will quickly run out of room when our newborn is here. We’ve already been declined on putting a rocking chair in the upstairs loft that nobody uses. It’s an issue to transition her office into a nursery for the baby. We really just want to move and we’d prefer they get their own place. 
We currently pay half of all bills, except grocery bills, which we pay roughly 80% of. When we moved into this living situation, no boundaries were set around rent and we had to make them up as we went along. We were originally each paying $900 a month and we experienced a tragedy in our family that set us back on paying rent. Due to that we had several months of unpaid rent and it got her into a rough financial situation. I’ve since paid my MIL $5000 to make up for this, and have taken over a larger portion of bills. However, I feel it’s now become unbalanced on the other end. It is really emotionally exhausting and frustrating living here. I’m sad this is our life and our children’s lives. I don’t see a way out. We could financially afford to move, but I don’t want to leave her hanging after she helped us when we were in a tough spot. The situation is so toxic for so many more reasons than I can even list. We are technically on a lease for 1.5 more years, but the lease is technically invalid because another roommate never signed it. I really want to move but don’t feel like it’s morally ethical- but my little family is suffering as a result.

Here’s my issue: clearly this living situation no longer feels suitable. We already don’t have enough space with my toddler and we will quickly run out of room when our newborn is here. We’ve already been declined on putting a rocking chair in the upstairs loft that nobody uses. It’s an issue to transition her office into a nursery for the baby. We really just want to move and we’d prefer they get their own place. 
We currently pay half of all bills, except grocery bills, which we pay roughly 80% of. When we moved into this living situation, no boundaries were set around rent and we had to make them up as we went along. We were originally each paying $900 a month and we experienced a tragedy in our family that set us back on paying rent. Due to that we had several months of unpaid rent and it got her into a rough financial situation. I’ve since paid my MIL $5000 to make up for this, and have taken over a larger portion of bills. However, I feel it’s now become unbalanced on the other end. It is really emotionally exhausting and frustrating living here. I’m sad this is our life and our children’s lives. I don’t see a way out. We could financially afford to move, but I don’t want to leave her hanging after she helped us when we were in a tough spot. The situation is so toxic for so many more reasons than I can even list. We are technically on a lease for 1.5 more years, but the lease is technically invalid because another roommate never signed it. I really want to move but don’t feel like it’s morally ethical- but my little family is suffering as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

A few months ago, we decided to help her and take her into our home so that she could be away from her husband during her separation. After she moved in, she decided to get into another relationship with a new guy that was also her cocaine dealer.

My wife is 25 weeks pregnant with our first child, and we had gone to Las Vagas for a mini-Vacation. On our 6 1/2-hour drive back Carrie calls us in a complete mental breakdown because of some things that her dad had said to her. After she got off the phone with us, she decides to drink 2 full bottles of our alcohol that I use to make herbal tinctures. Then she steals my wife's car, drives it to her cocaine dealer, takes cocaine and drives to her now ex-husbands home. After she get there, he calls her mom, and her mom goes there to check on her. Her mom shows up and finds her upside down in the car and unconscious. Her mom immediately takes her to the ER. After arriving to ER, she becomes belligerent and pissed off that she is in the hospital. On a side note, she has been for the past few years had her husband saying things like if you get admitted to the hospital, I am taking away your kids. My wife on the other hand has said many times that there is no helping her, and you cannot force her to do anything otherwise she will shut down.

,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for “borrowing” my roommate’s 300-pound antique mirror?

Okay, so hear me out: I (23F) live with my roommate “Nina” (24F), who is basically the queen of thrifting. She’s one of those people who has a sixth sense for finding super cheap, amazing stuff at flea markets, and I admit it’s pretty impressive. Our apartment looks like a Pinterest board, all thanks to her.

Anyway, a few months ago, Nina found this massive antique mirror. Like, this thing could easily cover an entire wall. She was obsessed with it and kept talking about how it “pulled the room together.” To be fair, it does look cool, but it’s also 300 pounds, and I’m constantly terrified it’ll come crashing down and flatten me.

Fast forward to last weekend. My best friend was throwing a Murder Mystery Dinner Party for her birthday, and we were all supposed to dress up and go all out with “luxurious” props. Naturally, I thought of Nina’s giant mirror. I figured I’d surprise everyone by turning up with a literal “mirror of mystery.”

Here’s where I might be the jerk: Nina was out of town, so I didn’t exactly ask her if I could borrow it. I enlisted three friends to help me lift it, got it in an Uber (barely), and brought it to the party. And let me tell you—it was a HIT. Everyone was taking selfies with it and doing dramatic “mirror, mirror on the wall” quotes. It was kind of the star of the show.

…Until I got it back to the apartment and noticed a huge crack down the side. It turns out that maneuvering a 300-pound mirror through doorways and stuffing it into an Uber multiple times wasn’t the best idea. The frame was a little banged up too, and one corner was chipped. I tried to set it back in its usual spot and hoped Nina wouldn’t notice, but she obviously did the second she got home.

Now she’s furious, calling me irresponsible and saying I shouldn’t have touched it. I told her I was only trying to add to the “mystique” of the party and I’d split the cost of repairs.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (26M) went out with my friends last night and my GF (25F) got angry with me. What happens next? 

So yesterday, I went out with my friends and got pretty drunk. I didn’t do anything wrong in my eyes and I just got carried away with my friends in a ‘good time’. My girlfriend was working (she’s a night nurse) and I ended up staying out with them pretty late. Almost until the bars closed. My friends and I just had a lot of laughs and a good time. I didn’t talk to any girls or do anything I shouldn’t be doing like I said. 

Everything was fine with our communication and she has my location and I didn’t move or go to a different bar. I just stayed at the same one with my friends for a long time. We were probably there for about 6 hours since there was a big game on and we got there early to get a spot. Anyways, me and my friends were noticeably getting pretty drunk and then my gf texted me and said “you’re still out? Don’t they close in 30 minutes” and I said yeah we are about to leave soon and order an uber. Then she proceeded to say “why are you still there. It’s been almost 10 hours like wtf are you doing” and then I said we are on our way back and she proceeded to text back and say “I’m legit pissed. Why the hell were you at a bar for 10 fucking hours what the fuck is wrong with you”

I really feel like this is a dramatic response and reaction. I also wasn’t there for 10 hours. Like I get it, I was out drinking for a long time and got carried away and that can be annoying. But you don’t have to get that pissed off at me. I also don’t do this ever at all and I don’t go out to the bars every weekend or something like that. I can’t remember the last time I went out to a bar and got as drunk as I did, and maybe that’s why she was annoyed. But you don’t get to react this way…  This isn’t the first time she has talk to me like that too. I have expressed that she needs to control her reactions better and not talk to me like the way she does when she gets upset. She says she will work on it but then does things like this. I’m struggling to understand her reaction to this and I’m afraid that this is a foundational issue in our relationship that hasn’t been fixed. I am starting to feel it won’t be fixed either. How do I handle this situation? Should she be reacting this intensely to something like this or am I the asshole?

I’ve been with my GF 25F a year now, but we’ve been on and off for 3 years. She weird about me having girl friends. Especially this particular friend. And I can understand it to a certain extent. In the past me and my friend may have shared feelings, a bit of flirting but we’ve never crossed that line because the friendship was just to good. 

Recently my GF said she’s not comfortable with us hanging out because we’re just to close and she thinks my friend has a crush. I explained to my friend I can’t hang out with her any longer but we could still exchange text occasionally.

Now here’s the thing, I was in a tight spot after a medical accident and my friend loaned me about 8000 dollars. 6000 I’ve paid back, the deal was that I’d pay her 200 a month for the rest of it. But now she’s saying that she wants it back now since I’m “choosing” not to be her friend. And I should ask my GF for the money.

To be that’s just spiteful and if she cares she’d understand the position I’m in. I also don’t really have the money to give and know my gf doesn’t. I also never told her about the situation I’m in.

My friend is saying if I don’t get her the money, she’ll send the request to my gf and expose a bunch of other stuff.

,AmItheAsshole,"So little backstory, my boyfriend (m/38) is constantly underestimating how much time he needs to reach buss stop or trainstop  or any other mode of transport that's organised  with a set time in mind, including when I pick him up with a car. Great example is that he needs to be home at 5 pm because we planned something important together and alot of things are reliant on that fact. He will come 40-60 min later,  blaming that he missed the bus. No problem most of you are probably thinking,  till the reason makes it self apparent.  He had to to the toilet... every single time he waits till the last possible second and he doesn't count in the walking time,how long he will need to be there and he doesn't even look up when the bus goes. Basically he does everything in his power to not succeed. So today we were at library together,  he had football training in the evening and we still had to get home early enough to prepare dinner,  att no point did he do any od the mental math required  to make the plans foe our return home so half an hour before our bus goes I let him know we should go. We pack up and we re go the lobby, it's  a 5 min  walk to the buss station and  our buss was going to be there in 12 minutes.  Mind you it's cold and windy outside, and buses go att a halv hour intervals,  it also takes 20-25 min to reach home by buss plus a 10 min walk that has us looking att a 35 min journey.

Great example is that he needs to be home at 5 pm because we planned something important together and alot of things are reliant on that fact. He will come 40-60 min later,  blaming that he missed the bus. No problem most of you are probably thinking,  till the reason makes it self apparent.  He had to to the toilet... every single time he waits till the last possible second and he doesn&amp;#39;t count in the walking time,how long he will need to be there and he doesn&amp;#39;t even look up when the bus goes. Basically he does everything in his power to not succeed. So today we were at library together,  he had football training in the evening and we still had to get home early enough to prepare dinner,  att no point did he do any od the mental math required  to make the plans foe our return home so half an hour before our bus goes I let him know we should go. We pack up and we re go the lobby, it&amp;#39;s  a 5 min  walk to the buss station and  our buss was going to be there in 12 minutes.  Mind you it&amp;#39;s cold and windy outside, and buses go att a halv hour intervals,  it also takes 20-25 min to reach home by buss plus a 10 min walk that has us looking att a 35 min journey.

,AmItheAsshole,"I'm (16m) the oldest with a younger brother (12) and younger sister (11). My parents have been SO bad at setting boundaries with my siblings because it works out for them. My siblings adore me and always want my help with stuff and want to spend time with me. Years ago I noticed that they'd make excuses about why they needed my help. I told mom and dad it was bullshit and they just wanted to spend time with me. My parents acknowledged once that my siblings were just making excuses, but they told me I should appreciate it because it meant they loved me.

A very common thing to happen is I'll be about ready to leave for work or meet up with friends for something we planned/to do a school project together. Then suddenly a piece of homework that only I can help with will come up and can't I please just cancel my plans to help because my siblings need their homework done.

Another common thing is I'm ready for a party and one or both of my siblings come to me with kicked puppy expressions and beg me to say because they miss me and I'm always busy doing something else. And they want to spend time with their big brother.

My parents pressure me to stay, my siblings beg and sometimes even do the whole drop to knees and clench their hands together in prayer type of begging. There have been consequences for me trying to continue with my plans. I already lost one job because of this.

I spoke with my parents on a few occasions and I got both sets of grandparents to help me two different times. My parents blew us all off. I have also sat down and talked to my siblings, tried to figure out a compromise, explained that they wouldn't like me making them cancel stuff to spend time with me so could they please stop doing it to me. They do not want to listen. My sister said ""we're only babies"". I told her she would not like to be treated like a baby in front of her friends but it did nothing.

Last Wednesday I was ready to leave for a study/project meet up with some kids from one of my classes. My siblings begged me to do homework. I had spoken to my siblings the day before about not doing this anymore. That day I told my parents it was a big deal for me to work with the group. It was a huge part of the class. But still my parents insisted that I help. They said I should think of my siblings. I tried to leave but they took my keys. My siblings started to say I should want to spend time with them and I lost my temper a little. I told them to stop. They got what they wanted and I was helping but this was the last time. I told them I will never help them or spend time with them again because they are too selfish to deserve it. My siblings got upset and my parents started to lecture me and I told them to save it because they are just shitty parents. My parents have really gone hard on me for what I said since last week.

,AmItheAsshole,"  I (54f) have a friend (55f) who went vegan 10 years ago. We’ve been friends 20 years or more. We have a large group of friends 15-20 and there are a few of us that switch off cooking dinner on Thanksgiving for whoever is in town. 
Since “Ann” went vegan we’ve always accommodated her dietary restrictions with at the very least some tofurkey, one side dish and one dessert being strictly vegan.  
  This year Ann jumped in early and for the first time ever said she wanted to cook Thanksgiving this year. Not a problem. Until she informed us in the group chat dinner will be 100% vegan. Some of us offered to bring more omnivore offerings, including a turkey and she insisted we eat vegan while at her house. She declared that vegan food “tastes exactly the same” as omnivore food. It does not. I’ve been to her house and choked down bean burgers and chocolate cake and probably a dozen other meals each of which she insisted tasted just like the real thing. She even tried to fool me once with a beyond burger, insisting is was a regular hamburger. 
  I have only found a limited number of vegan dishes I enjoy and none of them have ever been made by her. 
After thinking it over and discussing it with my husband we decided to privately tell her we were bowing out of dinner on Thanksgiving this year. I told her I wanted turkey, mashed potatoes, pumpkin pie that were made with traditional ingredients. 
  I could have lied and said we had plans to travel to see family but I don’t want lie. 
  Ann has become angrier and angrier with me since I told her this about a week ago. Then she went and complained to some of the women in our group about me refusing to attend just because she’s cooking. 

Which is sort of true but still made me angry. So I ended explaining to the other ladies that we all very considerately make vegan dishes just for her at every party and get together any of us throw and it’s really unreasonable for her to insist that I strictly adhere to her dietary choices when I have never demanded the same from her. 

  So that blew up because all the ladies have now jumped to my way of thinking and decided they will have Thanksgiving at one of their houses instead. (We will not be attending their Thanksgiving either)

  My husband says we probably should have lied about going out of town or at the very least I should have not explained my reasoning to the other ladies.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (35f) and my family (husband 37m, daughter 11f, and daughter 6f) just attended a Halloween party where my oldest daughter was awarded first place in the costume contest. 

Some back story; I spent the last 3 months planning, designing, and hand making all of our costumes. We went as Alice in Wonderland characters. I was the white rabbit, husband was Mad Hatter, youngest was Alice, and oldest was Queen of Hearts. Her costume was by far the most involved and difficult for me. I literally broke down in tears over the standing collar 3 days before the party. My daughter, though she is very creative and artistic, did not give me much input into the costume aside from a few ideas on details and encouragement throughout the process. Tbf I didn't expect her to, she's not as into Halloween or dressing up as I am. 

The day of the party, all the elements came together perfectly. Her costume was one of the best I've made, her hair and accessories were perfect. And out of 30+ people, her costume won the contest. I was very proud watching her accept her prize which was a trophy and a gift bag. When she sat down to look in the gift bag, she showed me the candle which I took to believe was the only thing in the bag. 

Later in the night, I was informed that there was also a $50 Amazon gift card in the bag. I found my daughter and teased her that she conveniently forgot to show me the gift card and that technically it should be mine since I did all the work (even though I actually had no intentions of taking it.) She got really flustered and upset but didn't say anything. Later her dad (my husband) found out about the gift card and also mentioned that it should be mine. At this, my daughter got upset again and said it should be hers since the prize was awarded to her. I told her she could have the gift card if I could keep the trophy out in the library and not buried in her room, to which she begrudgingly obliged. 

We've all had 2 nights to think on it and I still believe that the gift card should go to me, but let me be clear that I do not intend to use the gift card, I only want my daughter to admit that I earned that prize and maybe a thank you for my months of hard work. I'm only making this post either for commenters to help me see how I'm wrong or for validation.

&lt;p&gt;Some back story; I spent the last 3 months planning, designing, and hand making all of our costumes. We went as Alice in Wonderland characters. I was the white rabbit, husband was Mad Hatter, youngest was Alice, and oldest was Queen of Hearts. Her costume was by far the most involved and difficult for me. I literally broke down in tears over the standing collar 3 days before the party. My daughter, though she is very creative and artistic, did not give me much input into the costume aside from a few ideas on details and encouragement throughout the process. Tbf I didn&amp;#39;t expect her to, she&amp;#39;s not as into Halloween or dressing up as I am. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day of the party, all the elements came together perfectly. Her costume was one of the best I&amp;#39;ve made, her hair and accessories were perfect. And out of 30+ people, her costume won the contest. I was very proud watching her accept her prize which was a trophy and a gift bag. When she sat down to look in the gift bag, she showed me the candle which I took to believe was the only thing in the bag. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the night, I was informed that there was also a $50 Amazon gift card in the bag. I found my daughter and teased her that she conveniently forgot to show me the gift card and that technically it should be mine since I did all the work (even though I actually had no intentions of taking it.) She got really flustered and upset but didn&amp;#39;t say anything. Later her dad (my husband) found out about the gift card and also mentioned that it should be mine. At this, my daughter got upset again and said it should be hers since the prize was awarded to her. I told her she could have the gift card if I could keep the trophy out in the library and not buried in her room, to which she begrudgingly obliged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve all had 2 nights to think on it and I still believe that the gift card should go to me, but let me be clear that I do not intend to use the gift card, I only want my daughter to admit that I earned that prize and maybe a thank you for my months of hard work. I&amp;#39;m only making this post either for commenters to help me see how I&amp;#39;m wrong or for validation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ps, I&amp;#39;m not on reddit a lot so I apologize if my post is not how it&amp;#39;s normally done. &lt;/p&gt;

I don’t know how to support her while not enabling these behaviors and sometimes I just want to say, “suck it up and handle your shit” (I don’t, I just want to..)&lt;/p&gt;

I recently moved in europe, im asian and moved because my partner and i wanted to take the next step for the relationship.

Everything is new to me and tbh its my first time moving in and living with a guy and meeting other cultures.

My boyfriend have a very close friend and dating a iranian girlfriend for the past 6years. Ive only met her 3 times, it was when we went to bowling, his birthday party and movie night. 

The problem starts on the 3rd time i hang out with them. We were invited to go on movie night, we went, and brought some snacks, we picked the movie called OUTSIDE that was actually produced in my country. Its a zombie movie and a drama. During the movie my boyfriend's friend girlfriend made a joke about how my language sound, at first i was like ""haha thats how my language sound"" it was weird but i didnt really mind it, but she made the same joke again, copying the way they speak but like ""blublublu"" and laughing, i didnt say anything and neither the two guys. I thought it was nothing, but she did it again and like before nobody said anything. 

By that time I was offended but i was still unsure what to react so i let it happen and acted like its nothing during that time. After the movie i just told my partner that im sleepy and want to go home so they talked a bit and then we went home. On the way i started subbing and told my bf about what i feel about the joke she made.

My boyfriend apologize that he didn't notice it but i asked him if it was racist because honestly this is my first time having this experience. He said yeah it was a bad taste. 

After that night my boyfriend message his friend saying that I was offended and frustrated about the joke his girlfriend friend did. His reply was really nice and said she didn't mean it and that he apologized he didn't notice it too. And my boyfriend just replied that he was glad he understands.

Then after that his friend message him that maybe they shouldn't see each other anymore. Like cutting the friendship! I was really shocked bc that wasn't my intention, im not angry and maybe she didn't think it was racist but i never wanted my boyfriend to lose a friend because of me. Now i feel like a big asshole costing my boyfriend to lose a 16 years of friendship.

,AmItheAsshole,"My sister has been with her high school sweetheart for 14 years now. They had a baby at 21 and broke up when the baby was around 18 months because he had lost his job and wasn’t making any effort to find another job (he also wasn’t helping much around the house). My sister was in financial trouble and had to sell her house because she could afford it anymore. They started a relationship again after a while and once they were in a good place, my sister bought another house and they had another baby at 27 years old. The baby is now 18 months and coincidentally enough he lost his job again and the same cycle has reappear, my sister is again having financial problems and my mom and I are trying our best to help her.

I live with them and had to work from home full time for a couple of weeks. My BIL would wake up around noon, play videos games and start “cleaning” around 4pm (my sister comes home with the kids at 5pm), his cleaning consist of reorganizing the kitchen (not actually cleaning the kitchen) and doing laundry. I’m my sisters main confidant, she’s talks to me about her frustrations toward my BIL and I try my best to listen and give her support. But I’ve develop some frustration because she’s always so lovey dovey with him and goes to his defence if I say anything “bad” about him. 

This weekend I cleaned the bathroom and their kitchen while they were both on the couch cuddling. After that, I played with my niece, my sister came to see us and I asked her if someone could pass the mop, she told me she was so tired she didn’t want to do any cleaning. I got frustrated and told her to stop talking and go. Several minutes later I confronted her alone and told her I couldn’t hear her complaining anymore, I told her I couldn’t understand how she was still with my BIL and that I was mad that I try to help her as much as I can around the house but I get shitted at if I ask for something. I said I understood why SHE didn’t want to pass the mop but that she could ask my BIL because he doesn’t do shit. She didn’t say anything, I think she was too stunned and we haven’t spoken about it either.

,AmItheAsshole,"I do pet sitting/dog walking as my side hustle. I have a few regular clients whose dogs I walk every day. One of my daily dogs lives in a cul-de-sac at the end of a fairly long street in a relatively rural area surrounded by woods. When I walk the dog, I start by walking up the street, and end by walking down the same street. There is no other path. 

Sometimes if the dog poops early in the walk, I will leave the tied off bag next to the stop sign to grab on my way back so I don’t have to carry around poop for 25 mins. It’s a bright green biodegradable bag, and I always leave it in the same spot so I don’t miss it, the bag is there for 30 mins MAX. This doesn’t even happen that often, MAYBE once a week. I thought this was fine; but I was talking to a fellow pet sitter and she freaked out on me and called me as asshole, INSISTING that I would be fined and lose my business. (???) I talked about it with my spouse later, and he agreed that i should probably quit the habit. 

So, AITA for leaving a bag of dog poop by a stop sign and picking it up later? 

Edit: I accept that this is asshole behavior and I will refrain from doing this in the future. I got the idea from the owner herself, I had mentioned that the weird biodegradable cornstarch poop bags she insists on using tear super easily so she told me she leaves the bag and grabs it in the way back when she walks the dog on the weekends.

,AmItheAsshole,"My mother has never been a part of my life. She didn't want to parent and found out she was pregnant with me too late to abort. She and my dad were never in a relationship. They hooked up a couple of times. Dad did DNA when I was born to confirm I (17f) was actually his. And he raised me without my mother and without any support from her. This was a decision they came to. Mostly he wanted to protect me from her dislike of me and worried child support might bring her out of the woodwork sometimes if she against it enough. He did, about a year ago, speak openly about this with me a year ago. Before I got some stuff but toned down for age reasons.

When I was 5 my dad met ""Katie"". For me Katie was mom, she was my best friend, she was my favorite person on the planet. We loved each other fiercely but our relationship wasn't as expected for my age when we met and the fact I never had a mom (just a mother who gave birth). She was sort of everything though. I can't fully describe it but I thought the world of her and I did call her mom a lot but I also didn't always. Just like sometimes I was her daughter but other times I was ""her Arya"". Katie gave me the best siblings in the world too. And she was adored by the whole family. Losing her broke us all and required a lot of therapy. I was 13 when she died.

My dad remarried 4 months ago. His new wife is ""Lizzy"". Dad, Lizzy and I went to therapy recently because Lizzy asked for therapy with us. My siblings haven't joined us. She has opened up about how she feels like she has no place in anyone's heart except for dad. But she feels like dad will always love Katie more and how hard that is. She said she expected me to have an easier relationship with her than my siblings because Katie wasn't just mom to me so less stepping on my toes. She said every time we interact she feels lesser. How she has found some of Katie's stuff and seeing best daughter (in law), best mom, best stepmom, best wife, best sister (in law) made her realize that Katie was seen that way by everyone and still is. How she's basically got no chance to be as loved as she was. How it's clear me and my siblings will always see her as the person who married dad. She said she's having a really hard time and even though it hasn't been long she worries she won't be able to make it work if this continues.

After she had opened up so much... I couldn't reassure her in any way she needed. I couldn't promise I'd love her one day. I couldn't promise I would ever see her as more than just the woman my dad married when I was 17. I couldn't reassure her of that stuff either or that she'd feel like real family vs someone dad brought in. I don't know what will happen. But I know I will never see her on the same level as Katie. This really bothered Lizzy's mom who was told about our therapy sessions and told me I should have reassured her like my dad did because I just sealed Lizzy's belief that she has no chance with me.

outside of the club we were queueing it was pretty long but my sister started complaining how i didn’t make the right friends out of the sudden while i was trying to lighten the mood while waiting by filming cute tiktoks . she started say how i didnt make the right friends that benefited me how the friendship i have now are so useless and obviously i got pretty upset and i was giving her reasons why i make friends not cause they give me what is cause i feel happy around them . 

this whole thing really ruined it but i didnt want it to affect me cause its my first clubbing 

we went in , this first few minutes were wonderful just vibing and vibing her checking to see if i was enjoying my night and i really was until i saw a few man grinding on her but from my view it looked like she was doing it so i pull her back but she wanted to stay at the same place WHATEVER

,AmItheAsshole,"TL;DR My brother tried to guilt me in to doing him favours, banned me from Christmas and now wants me to come to him to resolve it. 

I 32F &amp; brother 31m have always had a tumultuous relationship. He's very entitled (my parents used to give in to him as a child because he'd throw things &amp; smash the house up). He'd often take your things if you wronged him &amp; you'd be forced to apologise or if you say no he'll keep on and on until you cave.
Last Friday he messaged asking for a favour, could I drive him to the station tomorrow. I said I'm busy. He said it was fine but was there space to park his car at mine. Yes but he'd need to collect car by Wednesday. I wouldn't be able to give him a lift to my house to pick it up due to work &amp; personal commitments. He ignored this and kept saying about me picking him up, why couldn't I do Wednesday. Told him I was busy.
He then tells me how he never asks for anything. How he's done so much for me. I said it wasn't my fault he can't get a bus and it wasn't my fault I can't just drop things for him.
He said how selfish I was, how he'd done everything for me but every time he asked for a favour I threw it back at him and he said how selfish I was (plus several choice names and swearing). 
I said expecting people to drop things for you with zero notice was the definition of selfish.
He called my family telling them how selfish I am and how he does everything. As he's organising Christmas this year I'm banned from that too.
Fast forward an hour and I get a message 'if I have any love and respect for him I'll meet him this week'. 
I've said I'll meet publicly to discuss and he's kicking off saying if I won't come to his home it's a problem and how could I suggest public what do I think he's going to do.

,AmItheAsshole,"I need boyfriend advice…

Hi! This is an account I made on the fly because I don’t really know where else to send this too. Anyway, my parents and I have always had issues. 
I (18F) have been seeing a guy (19M) and we’ve gotten pretty close over to course of a month or so. I have met his sister and somewhat met his parents over the phone. 
My parents have been strict, and I get it is for my safety and so on. But I’m sorta getting tired of it. Here is a list I can’t do:
1. Bring my phone into my room anytime during the day
2. Have to go to bed at 9:30 or whenever my dad feels like it
3. I can’t show my croptops to my parents since my mom especially finds me a “wannabe slt”
4. I can’t go out without telling my parents who I’m going with and where I am going. (I get this one but just putting it out there)
5. Not allowed to have socials
6. I haven’t asked but since I was 16 I wasn’t allowed to date.

Now some of these make sense, but lately they have been going through my phone and being more protective. All I want is to date in peace and not get yelled at. I have always had a hard time with my parents yelling or calling me names. I’m not sure what to do or what else to type. Please ask questions and maybe some advice…. 

I also acknowledge that I do live under their roof.

,AmItheAsshole,"
I (26f) have 4 siblings (2 brothers, 2 sisters). They now all have children and I am the only sibling that does not. Each year for Christmas, we all buy every child (8 kids) a present each from our own budget, and do Secret Santa amongst us siblings and include our parents.

We keep the Secret Santa budget to €50. It's not about the quality of the presents, it's just for us all to get to open a present each on Christmas morning. It has been our family tradition for years.

My oldest sister (37f) has 2 kids and is currently pregnant, due her 3rd baby before Christmas. Usually this time of the year, we pick our Secret Santa names but my sister said she doesn't want to do it this year as she is not able to afford it, which I thought was totally understandable.

What I have a problem with is she doesn't want any of us to do it. She wants us to get each kid a €20 toy shop voucher and to just buy my parents a present as a gesture for all the babysitting they do during the year. 

Although I know her idea comes from a good place, I still don't see the point in it. It might seem selfish but I know I will miss opening up a present Christmas morning. I do appreciate my parents, but I know it will put them in an awkward position as they would usually only have to get one person a present, but now they will feel like they have to get us all a present.

My mother's birthday is 5 days after Christmas and she usually gets presents anyways from all of us.

I think that spending €20 on each child isnt too expensive, but I find it deflating as they don't even appreciate the presents. Past years, they get so much from Santa and everyone else that my presents are just thrown in the corner. I would rather spend my money on someone who would genuinely appreciate what I got them.

I tried telling her that I didn't think it was a good idea and she told me that my point was selfish, Christmas is just about children and I will never understand until I have my own.

,AmItheAsshole,"**Context:**

I (25M) rent a room in a house and have lived here for 2 years. My housemate (25M, who owns the house) was my best friend since school but I would say our friendship has deteriorated over this time.

To be polite, I think my housemate has a lot of growing up to do. He is negligent in looking after his house, rarely cleans or tidies, does the bare minimum for a rescued cat we took in, and the garden is an overgrown wasteland of weeds. His job has an odd shift pattern but on days off he just goes to his parents' house and takes his laundry with him. He stopped asking to hang out a long while ago, so I don't spend any quality time with him anymore despite living in his house. He still goes to see other friends or invites them over so I feel he has neglected our friendship entirely.

I have been with my boyfriend for a year and a half and we have never done anything like what I am about to describe. He has witnessed this as the sound comes through on video call.

**Conflict:**

About a month ago, housemate brings a new girl to the house. He says they've been on a few dates and it's been going well, so I congratulate him. I stay out of their way as it's the early days and they want to have dinner and watch TV or a film together, much like my boyfriend and I do, all good.

Then the sex starts. This girl is an absolute screamer. I am talking moans to out-do even the most over-eager pornstar. Cat yowling, tortoise sex, donkey roars, dying child. All good comparisons. They were doing it past 2am which kept me AND the neighbour's dog awake (it started barking. The houses are terraced so the walls are connected to the neighbours too). I manage to get to sleep, but am startled awake 5 hours later when the moans pierce through the walls and shatter my dream state.

I spoke to my housemate after the girl left, jovially explained I heard everything, tried to make light of the situation. I can overlook a one-off or even two-off if it was an errant good night for him. He's also had other girls over without any problems. He loosely apologised but then said ""I can't promise it won't happen again because it probably will"". The next time he said she was coming over, I more seriously asked in passing if they could keep it down and was met with a sarcastic ""No"". The situation still continued. Screaming at night, screaming in the morning.

Last night was the 12th occurrence by my count, and I snapped. I shouted through their door ""Could you please shut the fuck up? Thank you"". They stopped, and I think she asked to be taken home as they fled the house soon after. It's now the day after and I haven't spoken to my housemate but I would appreciate an apology and acknowledgement it will stop. I tried being diplomatic, but it seems like he hasn't bothered bringing it up with this girl, so I don't think I had a choice other than the nuclear option. It was driving me crazy, and honestly, I don't feel bad in the slightest. I live here, I can reasonably expect some peace.

,AmItheAsshole,"

So, I’ve been getting some flak at work because a well-liked co-worker of ours got fired for repeated absences after I stopped giving him a ride to work.

As background, I’m an Active Duty Military mid-level healthcare provider and he was an entry level civilian contractor. We both worked at a large Military Hospital.

Earlier this year, “John [20m],” who recently started working at the hospital, was asking around our department for people he could carpool with. Everyone gave various reasons why they couldn’t help, and eventually I volunteered because he lived nearby and it wouldn’t be out of my way to pick him up.

(I will preface this by noting John was very well liked in our department with most of the older ladies adopting him as their “work son” etc. He’s also the youngest employee by almost a decade.)

This issues started about one month in when I noticed every morning after I picked him up, he would bring various food products to eat on the drive to work. This didn’t bother me at first, but as time went on he was leaving food trash and crumbs in my vehicle. I’m an extremely clean individual, so this bothered me and I said something. He continued eating, and kept forgetting to clean after himself. I was getting tired of constantly reminding him to take his trash with him, and I started just throwing the trash away myself. After doing this a few times, I decided to just leave the trash, and see if he would notice.

He didn’t. For weeks the empty water bottles, redbull cans, candy wrappers and empty containers started to pile up in by passenger door and floorboard, and stayed until I asked him politely “could you take that trash with you?” His response of “yeah of course, I don’t mind” made me feel like he thought it was MINE and I was asking for a favor. 

There’s more examples, but to keep things short, I gave him an ultimatum, he needed to clean up after himself and respect my car, or he would need to find another ride to work.

Not even a week later, he was eating some type of meal with flaky crackers and it was spilling on his lap the entire ride to work. When we pulled into the parking garage, he dusted all the food crumbs from his lap onto my carpet. We left the car and went to work. After work, when I returned to my car, there were ants inside of my vehicle.

I had enough. So I made up an excuse, and told him I couldn’t give him rides.

He took it well, and the rides stopped. But over the next few weeks, his tardiness started to pile up. His agency fired him in September. We are not privy to contractors personnel issues, but everyone assumes he was fired for being chronically late.

Fast forward to today, while on break, I overheard some folks saying he was fired because I stopped giving him a ride to work and that was selfish of me etc. I never told anyone except him why I stopped, and I’m assuming he told them some half baked truth and because he was well liked, I know they believe him.

According to dad's cousins and aunts and uncles, my dad and his two siblings never liked Tom and never wanted much to do with him. Tom married my grandma after my grandpa died. My dad was 8 when his dad died, his siblings were 4 and 5. My dad was maybe 10 or 11 when my grandma and Tom got married. I don't know the exact age. I know my dad feels like Tom had no respect for his dad's place in his life and wanted to take over everything. He never told me but I have heard him talk about it before.

With my dad and his siblings being adults now they have a really minimal relationship with Tom. They still speak to grandma but we don't see her often either because she wants Tom to be included and they don't want to see him. But she also doesn't want to lose out on her kids or grandkids.

My dad let me and my siblings call Tom our ""step-grandfather"" vs grandma's husband. But we'd call him Tom to his face not grandpa.

My aunt has her kids say grandma's husband and Tom.

My uncle has his kids just use Tom and he has no role/title for them at all.

Me and my siblings see him and grandma the most, but not a lot either. But now that I'm older (oldest grandkid overall) I see them a little more often. Or I did. I stopped going as much because Tom wanted me to help him with dad and he wanted me to act as like a go between and to ask dad to accept Tom. He wouldn't stop asking me when I'd see him and grandma and I did ask several times. I told him I didn't want to be used in their issues but he said dad loves me and I could be the person who helps bridge the gap. He said he's tired of being Tom to all of us and he wants to be dad and grandpa. He told me my dad was the ringleader and the reason my aunt and uncle never liked him. He said if he can get through to dad they'll follow along. I said no so many times. Then I stopped going. Tom called me and asked where my visits went and had I asked dad for him yet. I told him it wasn't my job to help him with dad. He lectured me about respecting my elders enough to help them.

,AmItheAsshole,"I met my now wife 15 years ago, she had an almost 1 year old daughter. I'll refer to her as “Kate”. Being a dad  was something I always wanted plus my wife is such a great mother I fell in love with her and Kate very quickly. Kate became my daughter, her bio dad wasn't involved. So Ive been the one helping with homework, at every gymnastics meet, giving advice when needed, at doctors appointments, etc, etc. I've never been a stepdad only a dad to Kate. 


I haven't had a good relationship in years with my parents. I have been in basically no contact with them for about 12 years. The only contact has been just with me and not my family and only via phone calls. That's only about once a year though around the holidays.  After they decided having  biological children was far more important for me than my already daughter kate. 

Kate passed away a month ago. It was very unexpected, it has turned my whole family’s world upside down. Whole family is in grief therapy and we are just taking things one step at a time. 

A week ago I got a phone call from my parents saying they heard from other relatives of mine about kate passing. Was wondering how I was doing and I ended up being really vulnerable sharing how difficult it has been for me and the rest of my family since kate passed away. My mom ended up saying at least I still have my biological children and Kate’s just my step daughter. I yelled at them to not refer to Kate as “just my step daughter” and I'm her dad in every way that matters because I have been there for her and love her so much. My dad called me an AH for yelling at them when they were just trying to help me feel better. My wife understands why I got mad but was wondering If I could have been a little more understanding because we have learned some people have a weird way of trying to  support when a person is grieving.

,AmItheAsshole,"Yesterday was my birthday (well, the day I, F33, and my boyfriend, M39, set aside to celebrate since we’re both working on my actual day). The day before, he admitted he was in a bad headspace, feeling down about a work project—a YouTube channel he’s trying to launch. He filmed the first video, hated it, and asked about our plans, seeming like he was hoping to have time to work on it.

I suggested we reschedule our plans and take the day to work on the video instead. I know he can get fixated when stressed, so I thought working on it might help him relax and enjoy the day more. But he got upset, saying that I “always make things about me” and that we weren’t canceling my birthday to work on his video. I explained I was just trying to help, but he shut down and got defensive, saying he didn’t want to talk about the plans. The conversation got heated, and he eventually yelled and told me to leave him alone.

The next morning, I apologized, saying I should’ve been more understanding and given him time to unwind before bringing up the plans. I also admitted birthdays are emotional for me because I tend to see them as a time when people show you how much you matter (I know that’s not totally rational). But he was distant and even mocked my feelings a bit, saying I was making things all about me. Still, he said he wanted to go ahead with our plans.

The day itself felt tense. We went to a Halloween town, but he barely spoke, walked behind me, and didn’t join me in the shops. I tried to check in, but he gave me short replies and insisted everything was fine. I cried quietly in the car on the way home, feeling hurt and confused.

When we got home, I thanked him for lunch and coffee, then went outside to smoke. Normally, he’d join me, but he stayed inside. When I asked him to hang out, he said he didn’t think it’d be a good idea with me being stoned and him sober, so I offered to sober up. He said he’d come out “in a while,” but he never did.

Later that night, I tried to explain my perspective over the past two days, wanting to understand where we went wrong. He said I was blaming him and not taking responsibility, and that our relationship felt broken. He ended by saying he doesn’t know how to fix things, then went to bed. I stayed up, cried, ate ice cream, and watched *Hocus Pocus* until I fell asleep.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (25F) have been married to my husband (25M) for 4 years now. We have a child so it limits our schedule a lot. 

Here's how our mornings used to go 4 months ago : I would wake up around 6am, get ready and go to work by 645am. Husband would wake up when our 2 year old woke up. Usually around 645 to 7am, then gets ready and takes child to daycare. It worked for a bit but my husband hated the schedule (Couldn't be helped, I was required to be in at 7am for work).

After some back and forth, I applied for a part time position at work/ basically gave then 2 months heads up that I'm quitting (husband doesnt want me to work anymore and i dont mind because it was his decision that i worked in the first place) and now I'm the one who takes child to daycare and my hours are significantly decreased. 

It was great, but husband still woke up same time anyway. Around 630 to 7am. I told him that I am quitting work because he *promised* to wake up earlier instead of me. I started working out in the mornings too, so I wake up by 6am to workout and then take a shower hopefully before child wakes up. 

It took some time but we finally agreed to start waking up 5am *together* and start our day (husband keeps saying he wants to get up  by 5 but he cant if im not getting up). It worked great and honestly I was very happy with it. But apparently my husband doesn't like it??

Today, we woke up at 545am, late because he wanted to sleep in so I'm like fk it, ill sleep in too. Child woke up twice at night and I'm the only one who settles the child at night so I'm tired anyway. 

We wake up, he goes to shower and I go to workout. Child wakes up just as I'm done on the treadmill so I got about 20 minutes of workout in. I hand the child to husband and tell him I'm taking a quick shower. He's pissed. It's 615am. I ask him whats wrong and he goes on a rant that he hoped I would help him get ready. 

I'm confused because I don't usually help make breakfast/ lunch for him unless we have nothing prepared in the fridge for lunch (I prep food before or we have leftovers for lunch) or if I want to make something special for breakfast. Plus we woke up late. So I tell him if he wanted my help, he could have asked. I didn't realize he wanted my help. He gets more worked up and said that he needs to leave earlier and now he's late. 

I went to take a shower and reflected on it but I just can't see his side in this. So when I was done and took the child (it's 6:30am) and he's still upset, I ask him why he's upset with me. He again, says that I should have helped him with breakfast so he could have left earlier. I just told him that if he wants my help, to ask me next time and he left for work in a huff. 

AITA in this situation? I'm just so confused 😭 

Edit to add: I forgot to mention that when he first told me that he hoped I would wake up earlier, he also said that he's upset that I waited until 545 to wake up. That I should have woken up earlier?? I told him that's not fair because I wake up with the child at night.

AND! When I missed out on working out for almost a week because of mental health, he said I was getting lazy so I have no idea what this man wants from me 🥲

,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for not wishing my best friend a happy birthday?

possible throwaway account

today is my best friends birthday — we’ll call them Sarah, my other friend we’ll call Hannah —  and i f(20) have decided that i’m not going to be wishing Sarah f(20) a happy birthday. my birthday was 3 days ago and she never told me happy birthday. we’ve been best friends for almost 10 years and she has never once missed saying it to me.

recently we’ve stopped talking — Sarah’s choice — because of a job. she offered to recommend me for a job at her workplace because I needed money for college. it was an under the table paying job, and i was delivering pizza’s. i loved the job, it was super fun, but i was also in college at the time doing a summer semester. i was starting to fail my classes because i had no time since i was working 3 part time jobs trying to pay for my summer semester. i decided i need to leave at least 2 out of the 3 jobs.

i was only there 2 weeks before i had to quit. i asked Sarah if she thought they could hold my spot for me while i finished the semester — kind of like when other college kids have to take a break from work to go back to school. she told me that i couldn’t do that and i would be replaced. i needed time to respond to her because her text most definitely came off as aggressive and defensive. i texted her later in the day, then she texted me the day after and it took me a few days to respond as i have adhd and get easily distracted with things and tend to forget to text people back. she sent another message asking why i was mad at her, and i replied with a huge text letting her know that i wasn’t mad at her and explained how she made me feel. i apologized and everything and she didn’t text me back. so after a few days i asked if she saw my message, and all i got from her was, “yeah”. so, i said, “okay” and we haven’t talked since july.

my other best friend, Hannah f(21), who Sarah is also friends with — we were a trio — texted me later in the day saying “sorry for texting you happy birthday so late”, BUT this morning i saw on her snap story that she made a huge collage of her and Sarah, wishing Sarah a big happy birthday. 

we’ve been a trio for almost 4 years and they’ve ALWAYS favored each other over me, and Sarah and i have only known Hannah for 4 years!!

not to mention, Sarah &amp; Hannah had a HUGE falling out recently because Sarah was in a domestically abusive relationship and Hannah was tired of hearing about it, so she stopped talking to her. both Sarah &amp; Hannah were good with me at that time and they both were talking so much shit about each other. then, we took a trip to a thrift store — Hannah was using Sarah to get a free ride there but Sarah didn’t know that — and then after this trip, they were all fine and dandy again (ughhh)

so, in conclusion, AITA for not wishing my best friend (Sarah) a happy birthday?

,AmItheAsshole,"Some background: my brother(19) Dave and I (34)  have a 15 year age gap because of that and crappy parents I took on more of a parental role than a sibling role. About 6 years ago I moved across the county. My brother came out as trans about 4 years ago. Our mother has become a huge bigot and is refusing to use Dave's LEGAL name or pronouns and does not believe trans people exists.

Current situation:  After graduating last year my brother decided to move in with me. I have been put in the middle of the issue between my brother and our mother for the last few years and over that time I have asked for advice from my close friends. At the time I never considered talking to my friends as outing my brother and realistically I talk about him a lot so when I started using his new name and pronouns it was clear what the situation was. 

Now that he has moved here I am realizing I outed this poor kid to my entire circle without his permission. He calls me aggressively an ally and has made it clear that he doesn't think I did anything wrong or harmful but I'm not so sure. 

He is not on hormone therapy and has not had any gender affirming procedures. He has said that my friends would know he is trans as he is not passing so its not a big deal but I genuinely feel like I took some of his autonomy away by not allowing him the space to disclose when and how he wants to. 

My brother is a beautiful human being and I know he would never hold this against me but I also know he lost the opportunity to navigate this as an adult on his own term on his first adulting experience.

,AmItheAsshole,"This might be petty asf but pls tell me (f22) how I should go about it. So my roommate (m21) messages in the group chat and says “hey folks, 
I've used someone's eggs from the fridge
I will return them when I get my grocery tomorrow”. When I got home I saw they were mine and they’re all gone except 1 ( I don’t remember how many were in there but I didn’t use much and it was a box of 12eggs). Now I don’t have a problem at all that he used them but the problem is he has done this before with other groceries like veggies and eggs and all and when he replaces them he gets the generic stuff like the cheapest option. I’m very particular about my groceries I take time to choose what variety of apples or tomatoes or eggs etc I want. And at most times I get the more expensive version cause I just like it better. 

Last time he borrowed some tomatoes and they were those heirloom tomatoes that I got from the farmers market and when he replaced them he got the normal ones to which I just said don’t worry about it I don’t want those tomatoes. Now this time the eggs that I use are the organic free range extra large eggs and they are expensive than the normal ones but I don’t want to use the generic ones just because he wouldn’t get them. 

So WIBTA if I say anything about these things, or if not then what should I say to him, I don’t want to make it too awkward but I would still like to address it. 

[UPDATE] here’s an update everyone has been asking for:
- I messaged him before he woke up in the morning (I made this post pretty late in the night and he wakes up around 6am) and said “Can u get the same exact ones pls
U can find it at (x) store, they are better quality and I just prefer these
U can just replace how many u used
Thanks :))”

[UPDATE 2] so this morning there were no sign of groceries but by evening he replaced the eggs in my same carton, like 5 eggs. I checked the fridge for his new carton, it wasn’t exactly the same ones from the farm brand I get but he got the free range extra large ones from another grocery store, it works for this once so it’s okay haha. Told him to be more mindful next time!

,AmItheAsshole,"Throwaway account … I‘m actually embarrassed by the whole situation.
And I apologize for all grammar/spelling mistakes.

This has happened a while ago, but it still eats away at me inside.
I (M45) got together with someone (F44) I was in a relationship many years before.
A lot had happened in our live since then, we live completely different lives in different countries.

She is not primarily a screenwriter, but tries to work more in that area (written one short movie that was produced up till now).
As she showed interest diving into it more, I looked up workshops/education/training she might like to attend when visiting me (I live in a big city, she rather rural).
She pointed out the ones I found weren’t suitable for her (and she was right), but encouraged me to attend a specific one of them myself.

It was a very basic workshop, but I really enjoyed the experience. I got some great feedback from the instructor.
I also loved that I could show more interest in her life, as now I could talk about her great passion and have a glimpse of insight.

Here’s where things got out of hand.
I asked, if she might be willing to read over my script (it was just single scenes) and maybe give me some advice or tips about how to get better. Hell broke loose.
I’ll try to quote without exaggeration 

“You are such an impudent and rude AH! Are you seriously asking this? I’m a professional, I payed for my education! And you think, you can just come and ask someone like me to give advice to someone like you?
This just shows what kind of inconsiderate person you are who only thinks about themselves. You have absolutely no respect for me.”

I don’t remember my reaction, but I assume it was a mix of disbelief/shock and the day turned into a long me apologizing and justifying myself.
Most likely I also got angry at some points as I felt attacked unjustified.

I brought it up several times afterwards, but she keeps insisting that I was a complete AH here.

I just can’t see it. It does not make sense to me at all.
But goddamn, there is serious doubt in me.
Am I just being ignorant for not seeing it??


Edit: this might be quite important to show her point of view:
She has been struggling work wise, as there just isn‘t enough work in her area (and it‘s not paid well). So her work/knowledge is pretty much everything she has.
I on the other hands do not have any financial problems at all and can attend such a workshop without much thought about anything (I basically did it for fun).

,AmItheAsshole,"I have a wife (Dhanyasri), 2 daughters (Kamakshi Devi and Chandrakanta) and a son (Phunsukh Wangdu).

When I talk to wife about the kids and I am referring to something that only applies to daughters I have always referred to them as the girls.

However often I am having to talk to my father and relatives about my family and when I need to tell them something that only applies to my wife and daughters I will often refer to them as the females. This is because in my language usually we don't really refer to our partner as husband or wife in conversation and usually use their names. Since their names combined are very long it is much easier to say that way. As I have only one son, I just refer to him by his short name Phunsukh.

They never had a problem with this and I have been doing it this way for years.

However recently when I was telling my father about how the females in my family all have similar characters, Kamakshi Devi told me she would rather be referred to by name and said something about one of her school friends telling her that saying female is a bad word. I don't understand how this makes sense but I agreed to do so.

However since I am so used to it, I have slipped many times and continued saying it. Kamakshi Devi got upset at me for this and now she has convinced Chandrakanta as well that this is a bad word. Obviously I want to please them and not say it but it takes time for habit to change. Even Phunsukh Wangdu agrees with me and says if it were the other way and he had a brother he wouldn't mind.

,AmItheAsshole,"A friend set me up on a date with one of his girlfriend's cousins. We met yesterday in person for the first time, and we’re having a good time together. I knew she’s a music student and a multi-instrumentalist. So at some point I asked her how many instruments did she play. She told me 4, and asked me to guess which ones. I got the first 3 right pretty quickly: piano, guitar, and bass… 

But I couldn’t guess the fourth one for the life of me, so I gave up. And then she told me her fourth instrument was her voice. And I genuinely started laughing, because I thought she was messing with me. I told her that voice is not an instrument. She said it is. I guess I kept laughing for way too long, because she eventually got serious and started lecturing me about how the human voice produces vibration and so on.

So at some point I asked her how many instruments did she play. She told me 4, and asked me to guess which ones. I got the first 3 right pretty quickly: piano, guitar, and bass… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I couldn’t guess the fourth one for the life of me, so I gave up. And then she told me her fourth instrument was her voice. And I genuinely started laughing, because I thought she was messing with me. I told her that voice is not an instrument. She said it is.

,AmItheAsshole,"BACKGROUND:  
My wife (F,56) and I (M,55) have been married since 2000, with once child (in college now). Solid, happy marriage. I'm a middle manager-type and was making about $135k/yr until two years ago, when the company for which I worked was bought and I got a nice payout. I had been miserable in that job for a long time and had worked very, very hard, so I quit. I've been working as a consultant fairly successfully ever since, but I still hate what I do. 

My wife left her job after our son was born in 2002 (her choice) and has been freelancing for the last 15 years or so. I've told her repeatedly that she doesn't have to work if she doesn't want to -- she has health issues and fatigue is a huge problem for her, plus we're solid financially. But she has always wanted to contribute to our income, so she takes work when she can. She's often lamented that she wished she could do more. Regardless, I've brought in about 85% - 90% of the household income since we married.

ISSUE:  
When I quit my job in 2022, we lost my employer health insurance. We found out that if one of us took a class through a local college -- just one class a year --  we could get insurance through the college that was good coverage for less than Marketplace insurance. So my wife enrolled and is taking a class. That's how we've gotten insurance in 2024.

Now... We recently determined that we've saved enough that we can retire early, so I'm stopping work at the end of 2024. I am ecstatic about it. But my wife now thinks that since I won't be working next year, I should be the one to take a class so we can continue getting insurance through the college. Her reasoning is that she'll still be working (even though her work is sporadic), so I should be responsible for taking the class. 

AITA for refusing to take classes? I've been carrying most of the load for decades and really don't want to take on new responsibilities, even if it's just taking a class, so soon after finally getting out from under my work responsibilities. Given how she's always said that she wishes she could do more, and this is something she can do, I feel like she should step up and continue taking the classes. And I don't like her assumption that it would simply fall on me now.

The other three have kids, this post is about A(35F) and B(32F), A have 4 kids (17F, 15M, 14M, 9F), the younger 3 have severe physical and mental disabilities. B have 3 (12M, 7M, 2F), the oldest and middle have the same disabilities as my older sister's children, and the younger have down syndrome. They are both SAHM, all the children are in the disability programs my country offers but there is not much money left, after all the medical bills of therapy and meds they need. Their husband's have ok jobs, but with the severity of the children's disabilities it is hard to go by. 

On the other hand, I am single, child-free by choice, went to university, totally debt free, have a masters, and work from home in my dream field. Last month I bought my first house.

I invited my family and friends for a house warming this Saturday. I paid for two caretakers to care for their children so they could come. Everything was fine and fun. Until the end of the night, my friends had already gone home, and it was the three of us. They started to talk about me setting down, marrying, and having kids, since I bought a house. I remembered that I didn't want kids. This talk circulated several times. Until they asked me why foi the tenth time. I told them, besides really not wanting to have a child, I love my freedom, I love the life that I already have. Thinking about our family DNA, that is a high chance of having a disabled child, that means more work and sacrificing, I don't want to sacrifice myself. I want to have money for hobbies, to take care of myself, for expensive clothes and hairdressers, to travel, to live and not just survive. I love them, they're great mom's but I don't want to make the sacrifices to be the same, I would be an awful and spiteful mom, and no one deserves that.

From everything I said, the only thing they listened to was about not wanting a disabled child. They went on a spiral about how much of a blessing their kids are, how I am an egotistical bitch, and so much more. They blocked me on social media, and aren't answering me in the family group chat. My mom called to give me a speech about how my disabled brother (36M)was a blessing in her life, how he is a gift from God, and uninvited me from christmas because my sisters won't come if I come. I called my brother (39), his two children are adopted. He admitted a long time ago this was due to the high chance of disability in our family.

My other brother also has an outstanding warrant in my state for unpaid fines, resulting in him refusing to enter the state I live in.

,AmItheAsshole,"This happened last weekend. Got three random texts in a row and then a phone call that was a number I (23m) didn't recognize. Didn't answer and read through the texts. Found out it was my stepsister (24f). Her car broke down, she was about 30 minutes from my place and her dad and my mom told her she could spend the night at my place and that I ""needed to come pick her up"". She called me again and I still didn't answer and I ignored her texts.

The next morning all hell broke loose. My mom called me a bunch of times and her husband was texting insults repeatedly at me. My mom asked me why I hadn't answered my phone or gone to pick my stepsister up. I told her I wasn't asked I was told and I do not welcome people in who I have a bad relationship with.

To sum up our relationship. We knew each other from kindergarten. We didn't start out a steps but as kids in the same school. By the time we were about 7 we had a very tense relationship. I don't know what started it but we fought a lot and it only got worse whenever we were put in the same class. My mom met her dad through the school calling them up and saying hey we need to talk about your kids, they fight a lot. Through that they started to like each other and began dating when we were 9ish. They got married 8 months later. Our dislike for each other did not change because we were supposedly family at that point. We went to therapy together and her dad sent us to this bonding camp thing where we had to do challenges each day for like a month in the hopes we would work together. I ended up with a dislocated shoulder from that because she refused to take part in one part of it and I fell. My mom put her foot down about it being the end of that. But we didn't even tolerate each other. It was either outright avoid and if we couldn't, there was tension, we glared.

We have not been in the same room since she moved out of my mom and her dad's house and went to live with a friend. 18 months ago I was in a pretty bad accident and spent some time in the hospital. No concern shown. She didn't call to find out how I was or come to see me. Did I care? No. But this is a point I will make because of the big deal about her staying at my place. We do not help each other or care what happens to each other and that's how it is on both sides, not just me. She had to get my number off my mom last week. She did not have it already.

Because I didn't answer or let her stay I was told I'm now a shitty, awful person and my mom's husband has asked repeatedly how I could do that to my ""sister"". My response to him was where was she when I was in the hospital. That was ignored. My stepsister ended up waiting in a coffee shop for her dad to make the 6 hour drive to her.

Adding extra detail I forgot in the main post: The texts/calls started at 10pm. Her car had broken down and she'd left a really shitty date and couldn't get a place to stay because everywhere was very busy because of two events going on. I found this out later.

We went to therapy together and her dad sent us to this bonding camp thing where we had to do challenges each day for like a month in the hopes we would work together. I ended up with a dislocated shoulder from that because she refused to take part in one part of it and I fell. My mom put her foot down about it being the end of that. But we didn&amp;#39;t even tolerate each other. It was either outright avoid and if we couldn&amp;#39;t, there was tension, we glared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have not been in the same room since she moved out of my mom and her dad&amp;#39;s house and went to live with a friend. 18 months ago I was in a pretty bad accident and spent some time in the hospital. No concern shown. She didn&amp;#39;t call to find out how I was or come to see me. Did I care? No. But this is a point I will make because of the big deal about her staying at my place. We do not help each other or care what happens to each other and that&amp;#39;s how it is on both sides, not just me. She had to get my number off my mom last week. She did not have it already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I didn&amp;#39;t answer or let her stay I was told I&amp;#39;m now a shitty, awful person and my mom&amp;#39;s husband has asked repeatedly how I could do that to my &amp;quot;sister&amp;quot;. My response to him was where was she when I was in the hospital. That was ignored. My stepsister ended up waiting in a coffee shop for her dad to make the 6 hour drive to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding extra detail I forgot in the main post: The texts/calls started at 10pm. Her car had broken down and she&amp;#39;d left a really shitty date and couldn&amp;#39;t get a place to stay because everywhere was very busy because of two events going on. I found this out later.&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"I love my mom and dad to bits, but i can’t put up with my moms behavior anymore. 

My mom and dad live down the road to me and my family, which has come in handy many times. But about a month ago, my mom started expressing really weird behaviour. She would kick off for no reason during family outings or dinners, and constantly made a scene when she didn’t get her way.

Every wednesday my parents would join us for dinner, but me and my wife slowly began dreading it, not knowing what chaos was due to happen. This one wednesday, we was all sat around the table enjoying our dinner when my mom excused herself to go to the toilet. I didn’t even realise, but my wife picked up on the fact she didn’t hear the stairs creak. We don’t have a downstairs toilet in our house, so me and my wife immediately got concerned. Me and my wife excused ourselves, and began to look for my mom. We walked into the kitchen, to see my mom with her fcking head in the oven. (i am aware this sounds very similar to that one episode from shameless) We shut our kids in the living room, my dad phones an an ambulance while me and my wife get my mom laid on the floor.

While at the hospital, it was then that my dad told me and my wife my mom had been physically abusing him the past couple weeks. My mom got placed into a mental hospital, and got discharged last week after being in there for a month or so.

Me and my wife decided it’s not a good idea for my mom to see the kids for the time being, but that also means my dad wont be able to. My mom simply wont let my dad go anywhere without her, and never leaves his side. Me and my wife sat them down, and explained they can’t see the kids for a while. My mom went absolutely mental, storming upstairs in a rage. But my dad knew it’s for the best, knowing number 1 it’s not possible for him to see the kids without her as she’s always there, and number 2 god knows what she’d do if she knew he could see his grandkids while she couldn’t.

I can’t help but feel guilty, my children constantly ask when they can see them, and they only have one set of grandparents.

I was very shocked to hear this as he seems so lovely and I told a friend about it and we were both like that's crazy and we assumed it's fine because he probably changed. Already mean. I knew these two girls there. I was thinking about Brad because the rumours were bad and one of the girls knew Brad's girlfriend. To the girl, I asked on the beach 'Do you know the drama about Brad?' as I thought they knew and would tell me it's not true as I was shocked. The girl didn't know and asked what it was, and on the second time I told her what the rumour was.

I told them I felt bad saying it after and apologised after for telling them and I realised the girl may go tell Brad and I was cooked. They didn't know about the rumour so when they asked me if I knew it was true, I was kind of shocked they didn't know so I said its true then because a friend told me. I should never have mentioned any of this stuff and later, I asked one girl if they told Tom and said I felt awful for mentioning it. I later told a friend (Janice) who knew the girls that I felt guilty telling the girls (Emily and Denise) because they probably told Tom and its not nice. In doing that, I essentially told Janice the rumour too. Emily was the girl who knew the gf and she did tell me it was untrue but since they didn't know the rumour, I wasn't sure as a close friend told me. 2 days later, Emily pulls me aside with Denise and asked me why I told Janice that Emily told me the rumour. I didn't say that but by texting Janice on the phone it twisted itself this way. I tried to explain that wasn't true but as they don't know me and know Janice, they believed her. They also accused me of spreading the rumour as hot gossip when I actually only accidentally told Janice in the midst of me venting about how bad I felt (so dumb).

I tried to explain I had no malicious intentions and said I'm really sorry for mentioning it and that I didn't say that about Emily. Then, Brad's gf messaged me and asked me about it and I apologised to her but I also said that if Emily didn't ask me twice about it, I wouldn't have said anything, i j wanted to know truth. This led to Denise messaging me on behalf of Emily, saying I was implicating her and Emily and I tried to explain my intentions which she did not believe as Janice told her a different story and she believed if I actually felt guilty, I wouldn't have said the rumour to Janice, which makes sense to say, but I just made a mistake.

I suddenly get a message from a friend who wasn’t invited saying “it looked like fun, and I would’ve gone if I was invited but I wasn’t lol” which felt super out of the blue and unexpected. This was then followed up by a longer message basically saying they felt upset at being left out and because of this viewed it as my friends and I no longer being people who serve them and ended the friendship right there. 

I followed up saying it wasn’t my party and I wasn’t the one who organised it and that we also had a karaoke booking which meant our numbers were limited but also expressed I didn’t appreciate her trying to make me feel guilty when these friends I went to the party with are my friends I’ve known for years and not really hers (she had meet some of them before, but she hadn’t been keeping in touch with them or had seen them since last year - I think I may have been the only one she had been still in contact with). I’m aware now I could’ve invited her out of consideration but it was really only a party for the core friend group. 

The friend hasn’t replied to my message or even opened it and when I last looked they had removed my account and unfollowed me so I don’t think I ever will get a reply.

,AmItheAsshole,"I (f16) and my mum (f42)'s relationship has been tense for two years. She is from China, but has pretty good English, and I grew up in Australia most my life, and my English is good, (yes it's relevant). 

During the last two years (2022, 2023), I had a 'rogue teenager' patch, where I was also dealing with clinical depression. She is very firm in her asian parenting style and it tends to clash with my upbringing in a western country, and also, my dad (m67)'s parenting style. During my 'rouge teenager' patch, I had a boyfriend, and I pierced my own ear, but I mostly kept to myself.

In response to my boyfriend, she called me a 'slut' and a 'whore' while I was at an overseas competition. I cried so loud in my hotel room, members of my team in different rooms told the chaperones that they should check on me. When they did, I told them what was happening, and my mum, of course, found out. She said she 'hoped CPS would take me away' and that she 'wasnt my mum anymore; biologically yes though unfortunately"". 

I accidentally came across text messages with her coworker, where she said that 'she wished she never had a child' and later, 'I hate daughters, I wish I had a son instead'. It hurt me alot but my dad said all parents say that so I tried to let it go. 

Then, at my lowest (mentally), I tried opening up to her and in response, she told me I was the reason she was depressed and that I gave her such 'PTSD' that she will never be the same, that I permanently traumatised her. She also often called me fat during this time, and complained to my dad that my thighs were disgusting. So I turned to my dad, and he wasn't happy with her, so she told me that I was 'trying to get them to divorce'. My parents are constantly fighting at the moment, and they live almost separately to the point where all my friends just assume that they actually are divorced and I feel it's my fault.

This is only a tiny, tiny amount of examples of the things shes done. When this all built up a few weeks ago, we had a massive argument, which ended in her apologising (after denying ever saying any of it), but I still dont truly accept her apologies. They are always 'I'm sorry if that happened', or 'im sorry im a bad mum' or 'I'm sorry youre so sensitive"" or ""I'm sorry but I didn't even know its hurtful"" and I dont feel like it's right. At the time, my dad said he's proud of her for being brave for apologising, and I should accept whatever I get. He said it's the language barrier's fault, not hers. 

AITA for not accepting this? Or is my dad right? I'm only 16, so some external guidance would be good.

She is from China, but has pretty good English, and I grew up in Australia most my life, and my English is good, (yes it&amp;#39;s relevant). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last two years (2022, 2023), I had a &amp;#39;rogue teenager&amp;#39; patch, where I was also dealing with clinical depression. She is very firm in her asian parenting style and it tends to clash with my upbringing in a western country, and also, my dad (m67)&amp;#39;s parenting style. During my &amp;#39;rouge teenager&amp;#39; patch, I had a boyfriend, and I pierced my own ear, but I mostly kept to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to my boyfriend, she called me a &amp;#39;slut&amp;#39; and a &amp;#39;whore&amp;#39; while I was at an overseas competition. I cried so loud in my hotel room, members of my team in different rooms told the chaperones that they should check on me. When they did, I told them what was happening, and my mum, of course, found out. She said she &amp;#39;hoped CPS would take me away&amp;#39; and that she &amp;#39;wasnt my mum anymore; biologically yes though unfortunately&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I accidentally came across text messages with her coworker, where she said that &amp;#39;she wished she never had a child&amp;#39; and later, &amp;#39;I hate daughters, I wish I had a son instead&amp;#39;. It hurt me alot but my dad said all parents say that so I tried to let it go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, at my lowest (mentally), I tried opening up to her and in response, she told me I was the reason she was depressed and that I gave her such &amp;#39;PTSD&amp;#39; that she will never be the same, that I permanently traumatised her. She also often called me fat during this time, and complained to my dad that my thighs were disgusting. So I turned to my dad, and he wasn&amp;#39;t happy with her, so she told me that I was &amp;#39;trying to get them to divorce&amp;#39;. My parents are constantly fighting at the moment, and they live almost separately to the point where all my friends just assume that they actually are divorced and I feel it&amp;#39;s my fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only a tiny, tiny amount of examples of the things shes done. When this all built up a few weeks ago, we had a massive argument, which ended in her apologising (after denying ever saying any of it), but I still dont truly accept her apologies. They are always &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m sorry if that happened&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;im sorry im a bad mum&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m sorry youre so sensitive&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry but I didn&amp;#39;t even know its hurtful&amp;quot; and I dont feel like it&amp;#39;s right. At the time, my dad said he&amp;#39;s proud of her for being brave for apologising, and I should accept whatever I get. He said it&amp;#39;s the language barrier&amp;#39;s fault, not hers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AITA for not accepting this? Or is my dad right? I&amp;#39;m only 16, so some external guidance would be good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR My mum made hurtful comments, and her apologies feel almost backhanded, so I refuse to accept them. AITA?&lt;/p&gt;

However, Emily recently started dating this guy, Jake (18M), who I can’t stand. He’s rude, makes inappropriate jokes, and just has a really negative vibe. I’ve tried to be polite, but every time I’m around him, it puts me in a bad mood.

A few days before the party, I found out that Emily was planning to bring Jake along. I said that I wanted just her to come because she was invited, not Jake, but she said she wanted to bring Jake along because they were dating. I panicked and decided to uninvite her, saying I wanted a “no drama” environment. I told her that I just wanted to keep it a small gathering with people I was comfortable with.

Emily was really upset and said she felt hurt that I would choose not to invite her just because of her boyfriend. I tried to brush it off, saying it was my party and I could invite whoever I wanted, but now I feel bad.

,AmItheAsshole,"Ah so many things to say, but we’ll start here. 

My husband (34F) is from Europe, hardly ever sees his family and because of immigration has only just now been able to travel back home after being stuck in the U.S for 4 years. He is extremely close with his family, so going 4 years without seeing them was destroying him in every way. We also have a daughter (2yrs) and of course want her to be close with cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. 

Last year was the first year he could go back home after the 4 years so we left for Europe and stayed for 3 weeks over Christmas/New Years. It was absolutely incredible and seeing him in his hometown, with his family, was something I’ll never forget. He was himself, he was home.

Now we live 30 minutes away from my parents, so they see us at least once a week. My mom and husband have not gotten along for a year now due to her emotional immaturity and lack of accountability. There’s so much to unpack there but I’ll just try to simplify, she is a recovering ""functional"" (whatever the f***) that means alcoholic. She gets weird sometimes and emotionally aggressive and my dad just follows along. It’s ridiculous and too long to explain but I hope you get the idea. 

Now we plan to go back to Europe again over Christmas to see his family, because he has a huge family and that’s the time of year when everyone can be together. My mom found out about this a month ago and has been absolutely angry and is taking it as I’m choosing them over her, and she feels it’s unfair to miss another Christmas with us again.

I 26f and my boyfriend 26m have been together for over a year and living together for 7 months now. He is an amazing and sweet guy, he always tries to do a lot for me and I appreciate him very much.

I feel like he doesn’t have any respect for any of my stuff while I am extremely careful with others items. The first instance was when he was helping me move, I have some upholstered chairs that are a tight fit but will fit through the doorway if you maneuver them right.

Another instance was when I had an old kind of beat up desk that I planned on fixing, he decided to use it as a workbench while he was fixing up a room in the house. When I saw that he was using it I was uncomfortable because it was a huge mess and easily scratched and I could tell it was damaged more. I ended up taking all of his stuff off of it and using one of his own things in its place. I told him to please ask before using my things because it had gotten damaged.

The hobby tends to take up a lot of space and can be expensive, so to lighten the load on her allowance (And by extension her parents finances) she uses my paints and tools.

It used to be that either her mom or dad would come along, but recently she has been to my place by herself. I was initially uncomfortable at the idea, but we agreed it's fine as long as she gives me advance notice and her parents know where she is. One of the reasons I didn't like the idea at first is that she asks a lot of questions about adult life and such. I consider myself kind of a fuckup, and I was and am still worried that I might be downloading some bad life advice onto her.

A few weeks ago she told me that she pretends to be a different person at school, she's part of the ""popular"" clique and says she fakes a lot of her interests and hobbies, because shes worried being honest will get her flagged as a nerd and potentially bullied. Mini-Painting is one of many things she basically tells nobody in her age-circles about. She has one close friends that knows the ""real"" her, but everybody else basically gets the ""curated for popularity"" version of who she is.

After telling me about it, she asked whether or not she should keep it up. Apparently her dad in particular has been vocal about ""be yourself"" in all situations, and you shouldn't have to fake being a different person at school. I want to stress that I do agree with him in spirit, but as someone who did have a bad school experience, I also know that just being you isn't always easy for teenagers.

So I told her that while its important to find people you can be straightforward with, everybody fakes a public persona to at least some degree. If she feels it keeps the peace and it isn't harming her mentally, it's ultimate up to her how she wants to act at school. Its only another year (Potentially 2) and the people you meet and hang with at school don't have to be the last word on your actual friend circle. I did encourage her to keep a good wire to her one close friend and that some more people she feels can be trusted wouldn't hurt.

A few days later, and repeatedtly since then, I have had arguments with her dad about the whole thing.

I told my mom we were going to leave before dinner since there was nothing for Olga (my wife) to eat. My mom said she could just pick the shrimp out of the jambalaya and eat the salad. I told her that’s not how it works. Then she she start insisting the veggie soup was fine. I pointed out that it wasn’t vegan because of the chicken broth. Which according to my mom was “bullshit” She then asked Olga if can’t she just eat normally for one day. 

My wife said no but she doesn’t mind just having the salad but I knew she was just trying to save the day and was fed up with how my mom was treating her, so I thanked my mom and told her we were leaving.

My mom freaked out, she blamed us with being disrespectful, she said she spent hours cooking all that food for me. I told her that's the issue, she should’ve thought about Olga too. My mom said i was exaggerating because “it’s not like she’s allergic or anything “

,AmItheAsshole,"Start of October, I came home to 3 large boxes with the same last name addressed to my house. I called my mom to confirm whether we were expecting anything from overseas relatives. When she confirmed we weren't expecting anything, she called the number provided on the packages. They stated they didn't want it and to do whatever I wanted with it and provided no information. The 3 boxes contained misc items like jars of spices and lots of packaged clothes. I wasn't a fan of the clothes so after putting off the donation for 2 weeks, I dropped off the clothes at a donation box. Today, October 27, my mom called asking if I still had the contents of the boxes and my neighbor called her to say it was theirs and they wanted it back. I told her I either donated or tossed everything. During the evening at 9, I return to my house to see a group of 7 people crowding my yard. They demanded to know what happened to their package and that I essentially stole their stuff. If I wasn't expecting a package then I should've left it outside and I had no right to throw their stuff away. The situation was escalating and they were getting very aggressive. I showed them the shipping label that showed my address on the box but their only concern was I stole their stuff. They threatened to give me 1 day to return their stuff or they would pursue legal action. I had called the cop at this point as they were causing a ruckus and yelling. When the cops arrived they talked to us and our neighbor. That neighbor was accusing us of stealing the expensive jewelry in the boxes. The boxes had no such items and looked to be from a dropshipping company.

In any case, I'm starting to question whether I am at fault. Our neighbor confirmed the phone number on the boxes was hers but during the call, they said they wanted our address to pick up the stuff. Since they lied about the content of the boxes I have little reason to believe in what they say. In hindsight, I could've done other things but what's done is done. If this does happen again then I know what to do. I talked to friends after this happened and they said if they were in their shoes they would also be upset if someone donated their items. Am I the asshole?

edit: I realise now the wording is unclear. The last name on the boxes is the same as mine which is why I asked my mom if we were expecting anything from relatives.

I (31F) am neurodivergent and have Bipolar. This is relevant for this story because a) social interaction wears me out (regardless of how much I care for the person or how much fun I'm having) and b) my sleep cycles are hard to manage, I struggle to wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle and too little sleep can induce a mania phase. My fiancé (37M) knows and is as supportive as he can be, although it's still a bit confusing for him, which is understandable, since he doesn't know how it feels. 

He, on the other hand, wakes up in a terrible mood. I've never seen anything quite like it, but I ended up getting used to it, I just try not to mess anything up until he wakes up, so that he has nothing to pick a fight about. 

We have a cat. To simplify let's go with Mocha for the cat and Matt for Fiancé. 

Matt works 7 hours while I work 8, so when I was given the option to choose my schedule I asked to clock in at 8am so I could leave at the same time he does (5pm). So I wake up an hour before him, feed Mocha wet food and proceed with my day. 

Sometimes Mocha wakes up at like 5 or 6am and meows for food. Something important is, if I wake up at this time, I either stay up until the end of the day but my performance is null, or I go back to sleep but can't get up on time to work. Today was one of those days, Matt woke me up to feed Mocha because he's on sabbatical and he's using some time to rest and sleep in, and I told him ""give me 5 minutes"". He got up yelling ""it's always me for everything"" (in his defense, he does most of the housework because I used to work freelance after work to make ends meet, and I haven't found a routine yet because I stopped that not long ago), slammed a few doors, fed Mocha, came back for his pillow and went to sleep in the couch. I got stressed out and had trouble falling asleep again, and when I did I missed the alarm and got late for work.

About the social interaction part, we had a friend over for the weekend, plus I have been sick and in pain (UTI and a flare-up of chronic appendicitis), so I was extra exhausted today.

,AmItheAsshole,"Hi! So I (15F) have a huge love of musical theatre and performing arts- since i was 4 it has been my dream to go professional and maybe even get a lead one day and the whole time throughout my life i have been faced with nos and have always felt like im not good enough which really affects my confidence sometimes.

Anyway, this year my school is putting on a production of Oliver jr. and i wanted to go for Nancy as she is the lead female and to be honest she's a really good character to play. Immediately I told my non-actor boyfriend (15M) that i was auditioning for this character, and i was explaining the characters plot line to him and he immediately went 'no' (if you don't know Nancy is romantically involved with abusive Bill Sikes, she eventually gets beaten to death by him) and i asked why he was uncomfortable with it and his answer was 'i don't want to have to watch you act romantically with someone or get beaten as that would be hard for me to watch.' Which i completely understood- i took time with him to work through it and explain it and i thought that there were only younger people going for Bill Sikes which put him slightly at ease which made him say, 'i won't come and watch but i will run through your lines with you if you get it and do what you need me for to support you.' which, with hindsight, was extremely reasonable- but i was still hurt as he is my best friend and partner and i just want to share all my achievements with him, so him not watching felt wrong.

I turned up to auditions, knowing he was prepared for me to get the role- i did, and i got a callback and i was so happy as i never get callbacks or make it this far in the proccess and the idea of playing a lead was slowly within reach but, there was this one boy (16-17M) going for Bill Sikes that I didn't know about and i told my boyfriend and he got so upset because apparently that guy was mean to him and was also older than us and he definitely didn't feel comfortable now with me playing his love interest. (This older guy is basically guaranteed the role- he was by far the best and the oldest which helps for Sikes) He doesn't want me to accept the role (which i still don't know if i got!) I feel terrible and torn and he keeps saying that im not putting him first which seems kind of true and i feel terrible but i also really want to do this school musical as being a lead would really help my confidence and it is something id been working up to for years.

,AmItheAsshole,"WIBTA - I found out who my catfish is

I(31f) met a girl online. We clicked right away and got very close and I ended up sending a bunch of photos before I met her. I thought maybe she was a catfish because she didn't want to talk on the phone, but sent time of realistic and relatable photos, honestly I was enjoying our connection so much I wasn't too worried about it. 
We talked for weeks and I was really invested. Eventually we made plans to meet up and they didn't show so I realized they were fake. We stopped talking. I tried figuring out who i thought it was, contacted the cops who were less then helpful lol. 
Awhile went by and i got over it.

A few weeks later though, they messaged me again- they missed me. Honestly I missed talking to and wasn't that upset after a few weeks of cooling off and kinda want to keep talking. 

We talked a bit, and I eventually got this person to tell me a bit about who they are. I dont even know how I got him to start being honest, but I said I was going to block the number unless I got some true details and eventually he sent me a photo. He told me enough of the truth that I had enough info to look for his wife on Facebook. But I didn't find anything.

Then tonight we were talking and I asked more questions and got the key piece of info to find her online. 

He's asleep and doesn't know yet, but I found her facebook account, his facebook account, his real name, their Instagrams. I figured out where he lives, where he works and I found their wedding video on YouTube where I can hear them talking and know their British lol. 

I genuinely feel friendship feelings and don't plan to ruin his life and his marriage. I'm not evil like that. He also has a daughter. His wife has no idea he is a catfish/romantic scammer. 

I think when he sees my messages tomorrow he's going to be very upset and scared. I have so much dirt on him. But again, I would never ruin his life.

My friends and I are in the same college year but go to different schools. Their school is known for parties, and mine is small and BYOB. They asked for me to visit them for a weekend so we could party together, which was exciting since I’d never been to an official college party.

Originally, I was going to drive since their school is 2 hours from home, but Kelly insisted they’d drive the 4-hour round trip to get me if I lent her money for gas. However, she took my card to fill up her whole tank and, on the ride, kept complaining about how tired she was from the drive.

Once we got there, I met Kelly’s roommate, Kelsey. She seemed nice, but we didn’t immediately click. We just sat around for hours before getting ready, and when I asked to stop by the store for a new outfit and a contact lens case I’d forgotten, they shot it down, saying they were too tired.

I ended up uncomfortable in my outfit, changing three times, but they seemed annoyed, so I just wore my original choice. While waiting to go out, they all cuddled together on the bed, leaving me to sit on the floor.

At the frat, the fun started (bc I was drunk), but tension remained. I kept getting left while dancing, and they’d have convos of things I obviously wouldn’t get. As the night went on, they got drunker, and I was the only one sober enough to help everyone get home. I held Kelsey up so she could walk, stopped Mia from talking to strangers, and got Kelly off FaceTime with random guys. I spent the whole night apologizing to strangers for their behavior. 

Back at their place, I changed Kelsey into pajamas, charged her phone, blew up the air mattress for Mia, and helped Kelly into bed. Yet, I ended up sleeping on the floor. By the morning, I was upset because the only night the frats were throwing, and it felt like my first time was just sad.

The next morning, I suggested going to the store again, and Mia literally said it wasn’t her problem.  And yes, I slept in my contacts both nights since they refused to go to the store (not good since my eyes are Sahara Desert dry).

Me,(16f) and my cousin (16f) were at a volleyball game. A guy behind us was talking bad loudly about our team (he’s our classmate). 

Mad at this, I told my cousin (my best friend) that he was talking bad about the team.  I said “I’m just gonna ignore him, he’s just being a ni****”. I’m black and native and my cousin is a Filipina. She then turns to me and says “(my name) you can’t say that you’re only ½ black. I looked at her and I said “what?” She sounded mad and I was shocked by her switch up. I told her how it didn’t make sense for her to tell me (a black person) that it wasn’t okay for me to say something I was allowed to say. I asked her how being only half black made me any less of one.. She said, “I’m just pressed about everyone swearing”. I said “(her name), people are gonna swear. We are in Highschool now, not grade 3”.
She told me she didn’t want me swearing and I told her that she wasn’t my mom and that I could swear if I wanted to. Mind you, she swears too, we both do.

I then get up from the bleachers and move to my other friend. We talk and eventually the game ends and I go home. Later that night though, guilt was tearing me apart. Me and my cousin have been friends since we were babies and we rarely ever had a huge fight. I decided that I was going to text her. I sent her a paragraph on how I was super sorry for arguing with her  and that I was going to improve on not swearing near her and that I loved her.  I wasn’t going to apologize for saying a slur that I could say because it did not affect her.She then leaves me on sent for 10 hours. She continues to talk in our shared groupchat with some other friends. The next day at school I walked up to her.  and say “hey, did u get my message?” She walks away quickly. At this point I thought “we’ll I’ll just not talk to her.. maybe she needs some space?” So I hang out with my other friends. 
Later at 3rd period, one of my friends walks up to me and says “(cousin's name) is crying because your not hanging out with her”. Why would she ignore me at school and want me to hang out with her?  Later, my cousin goes home crying. After school I go home and my mom wants to talk to me.
She says that my cousin told her I was calling her names and being rude to her. Being family and all, my moms now into this mess. I figure out that the name calling was a nickname me and our mutual friend group used.  she got super heated about it and said we were “making fun of her name”. It happened a month ago and was forgotten. I realized that my cousin was telling our moms things that were convenient for her at the moment. I got grounded. I went on my phone 2 hours later and I saw  that my cousin liked my apology.(Instagram reaction) she did not reply,she did not apologize. It was like I was the only  person in the wrong. I apologized  so that we could get over the argument and that we could be  friends.

,AmItheAsshole,"- Background  -
I (21M) have been playing games all my life and roughly 3ish years ago I started playing games with a consistent group of people on all kinds of games.  Many of them were some of my closest friends especially one, Lenny (21M). 

- Story  -
At the start of 2023 me and a few friends from our group switched to PC gaming after a couple years of playing on console together.  We would play ALL the time with any free time we had and even would make YouTube videos together and all that fun stuff.  

As time goes on me and Lenny get close like near best friend status if that makes sense.  He soon comes out to me as gay which is awesome because I’m also gay and didn’t really have any gay friends that had any of the same interests as me.   But that was when he started acting weird while we were on call, like getting upset when I would talk to people in game, going silent when I didn’t do what he wanted and insulting me when I couldn’t be on the game at all.  But I brushed it off.

We continue to grow closer to the point where we both feel comfortable opening up about our mental health and things get very deep and personal at that point.  But the conversations are strange, he opens up to me but any times I try to open up it wouldn’t get any comment or would be turned into something about him.  I blew it off like whatever it sounds like he has it worse anyway (do not compare struggles, everyone lives different lives and struggles on different levels, treat others with respect).  

Around September of 2023 I get a new job and a boyfriend (21M) that I am very happy with!  But I hold off on telling Lenny about my boyfriend because I feel he may react poorly to it.  As I’m not able to play games as much any more, me and Lenny’s talks about mental health get more and more intense.  To the point where he tells me his plan to do things to himself and how it would be better if he wasn’t around anymore.  

One night it eventually got so bad that I had to call the police to do a wellness check on him (we live far I couldn’t just drive there).  And when the cops leave he is livid with me which I expected.  But in good news as of a week after the wellness check he is making strides to benefit his mental health like opening up to family, going to therapy and discussing medication.

This is when I find out that him lashing out at me and telling me he had plans to do things to himself was because he thought I had a boyfriend and that I wasn’t able to get on anymore.  He had feelings for me I could not reciprocate and instead of accepting that and moving on he tried to claw me down for being happy.  I blew up angrily and eventually blocked him.  It is now nearly November of 2024 and I blocked him around February of 2024 and I am the happiest I’ve ever been.

,AmItheAsshole,"I love my wife. She is intelligent, and sweet. Also she is beautiful inside and out. She teaches high school English and Social Studies. She loves novels and usually has several on the go. 

However she cannot follow the plot of a movie to save her life. Unless it is about a big city lawyer visiting her home town to shut down the local factory but instead reconnecting with her high school boyfriend who is also the local baker and mayor. 

I've known this about her for years and I have accepted it. I just like vegging with her so I am happy to see white people rediscovering the magic of Christmas. Or whatever. 

When we were dating we watched The Matrix. The questions she asked had me wondering about her. Ditto for anything complex. Even The Usual Suspects where they lay everything out for you she didn't get the ending. 

We had her sister and brother-in-law over for a couples night on Friday. We made supper and the plan was to watch a movie. Hee sister wanted to watch Shutter Island. I will not spoil it but the movie has many twists. The ending is awesome. 

I tried my best to suggest anything else. The new Laura Dern movie where she bangs the kid from Hunger Games. They all ganged up on me and said we were watching Shutter Island. 

My wife proceeded to embarrass herself by not understanding the ending and asking questions that were not great. 

Her sister and her husband were looking at my wife like she was Simple Jack. I tried my best to cover for her or telling her I would explain it later. She got mad at me for not just answering her questions. 

After they left she started in in me. She said that she noticed that we always watched a certain kind of movie and that she thought I enjoyed them.  I said I did because we got to spend time together and that mad me happy. 

She said that she was not an idiot and that she just didn't concentrate on movies. She recited the plots of several novels to prove her point. I said that I had never commented on her intelligence and that ahe was smarter than me. She says that I'm a jerk for not watching movies I enjoy with her. 

So I agreed and we watched Memento today. I think her head almost exploded from bot asking questions. I saw her on Wikipedia reading the plot.

He’s been talking about this for a couple weeks now and not once did he ever initiated about inviting me at all. All his friends are going with their SOs. It makes me sad that he invited them but not his own girlfriend. He even said that he wanted to match costumes but I said what’s the point if we’re not together.

Him and his friends mostly consisting of guys and two girls which are dating of the guys in the same friend group have known each other since elementary school. I have met most of them and I’ve met his parents too. I was trying to be chill about it but Idk why its making me so upset. Its gotten to the point that I have unintentionally been giving him the cold shoulder every time he talks about this party. Am I being too controlling or too jealous? 
 
Update: For those saying that if he suggested that we’re matching I should assume I’m invited right away. He agreed with my comment and said “thats true” “I guess I should just match with my other friends”. Thats why I assumed that I’m not invited at all. The reason why I don’t want to ask him directly either is because I want to avoid coming across as too controlling or needy, but it's hard not to feel upset.

Update 2: I just had a conversation with him about the party, and he said he didn’t think to invite me because he thought I’d feel awkward since I’m not close with his friends. I told him I’d like the chance to get to know them better, and he said, “If you say so, you can go if you want.” Hearing that response didn’t help; it felt like he didn’t genuinely want me there. Now, I’m stuck. If I go, I’ll feel like an unwelcome guest, but if I don’t, it could lead to a fight. I’m at a loss for what to do next.

Update 3: For those saying I’m the asshole. Don’t worry I already decided not to go. He made a group chat for the people invited which I’m not part of.

,AmItheAsshole,"Ok so. Basically it's 12:00 at night and I'm asleep, we've been fostering 3 puppies, my little sister who's in middle school gets up around 5:30ish by choice, bus gets here around 6:30. Im in high school and do virtual school and get up around 8:30.

I'm sleeping in my room, and my little sister draggs the kennel of screaming puppies into my room, hits me to wake me up and says ""their your dog's and your responsibility so fix it"". Then slams my door and leaves me with yelling puppies.

I tried to ignore them, then she comes in a second time, hits me again and says ""fix it"" again, so I got up to see what was wrong and they had #2 in the kennel and walked all in it, there was a blanket over their puppy pad also. Take not, these are NOT my dogs. They where my mother's choice to foster, she said they where her responsibility, they have never been my responsibility.

So I picked up the kennel and put it back in my sister's room, found out the puppies had pooped through the kennel bars on her floor, sister gets up runs to mama in tears and all the sudden she's mad at me, we drag the kennel outside, sister gets to go back to sleep, we get out there she starts screaming at me that I'm selfish and self centeted for not fixing it.

I told my little sister to let them out before they go to sleep, I told her to. She did not.

After she says something like ""your sister has to get up in the morning, you do not, your being selfish!"" And I don't think I am? I mean I get not knowing what to do in that situation but she could have asked me for help, if anything I think she should have woke my mother up about this. Not me.

After I cleaned the kennel and sprayed the puppies of and locked them in the outside kennel (don't worry they aren't cold, and their comfortable). Then I went inside and tried to go back to sleep to be fair took me less than 20m, but now I'm in trouble for not taking care of my sisters mistake of ignoring my warning  because she has school in 5 hours.

For some context - I 16f live primarily with my Mom 45f and visit my dad 56m, (50/50 Custody) I also have 2 younger siblings (14f &amp; 13m). 

Anyway, I had a sport thing on Saturday night and over text she made it very clear she was out and wanted nothing to do with it which I didn't mind considering my mom hasn't been there. Which I don't entirely understand. She constantly says that I do not want a relationship with her when that's not true I've begged, pleaded, cried, screamed, yelled, asked nicely, literally everything I can think of to try and make it work but it never seems to do anything. She consistently puts it all of me which I understand The relationship works both ways but I feel like She should still be putting effort into it. Im only 16. So she rarely shows up in person, offers a little emotional, and on top of that almost everything financially for me falls on my dad.

The problem hit when she did show up.

She has a habit of taking really bad pictures and posting them, I had just finished my program and I posed for like 3 pictures, and then im trying to figure out what my team is doing she got all upset and was yelling about something and I kinda snapped at her and was like ""Mom not right now I need to focus on my team and what going on I don't want to take pictures"" and she got upset and was like okay Im leaving than. I was a little annoyed/upset and was just frustrated as to why she came at all. Eventually, I figured out what was going on and walked out into the hallway and my mom was still there, we took some more pictures and then she left. Now I knew she'd probably post something but to say the least they weren't great and people from my school followed her. When I saw them after the show I was naturally upset and called her and asked her to take them down. She then proceeded to snap at me and get upset when she got home that night she yelled at me and was basically like ""IM your mother I can do whatever I want"" Now I might be the A-hole because in response I went ""Are you? because you don't act like it."" and I went to my room, she ended up putting the screen recording on my phone and I have currently been resorting to my laptop.

Here is where my AITA comes into play, I love my mom I do, BUT I only have so long left before I go off to college and I don't want to spend it walking on eggshells miserable and she only ever hurts me more than she helps. She contributes very little and takes a whole lot more. I think living with my dad would be better for me and it's something I would like to do, I've considered it for years and it's not like I haven't been with him full time for longer periods before, and I'm usually always healthier when Im at my dads. I don't want to hurt my mom or to leave my siblings behind to take the brunt of it and I feel like if I push for this and look into this it'll only be a disaster.

,AmItheAsshole,"This has been eating away at me all month and I need opinions from people I don't know.

**(CW: extremely brief mention of an ED.) (EDIT: grammatical errors.)

This past week, my friend group, who I will refer to as Marcy, Kendra, and Wendy (just in case they find this), has been divided. Kendra and I are on the same side, while Wendy and Marcy are on their own side. And just for further context, we are all female, and currently in college.

For the past month, Wendy has been avoiding talking and hanging around me, only coming to me when no one else is available. I saw this as her going through some sort of ""mood,"" but became suspicious when Marcy slowly began to distance herself from Kendra and I. Both me and Kendra hadn't talked to either of them in a while, and on the rare occasion we did have a conversation with either of them, they were standoff-ish, dismissive, or just entirely rude. 

Finally, just recently, we (Kendra and I) decided to address the elephant in the room. Wendy accused us of ""not valuing our friendship,"" ""stressing them out,"" and ""ridiculing them by calling them fat and ugly."" Specifically, I was told that I ""Ripped apart the friend group,"" and ""Now that (i've) made my bed, I gotta lie in it."" I haven't talked to either Wendy or Marcy in the past 2 weeks.

All my life I haven't been able to keep friends around, and I was open to Wendy and Marcy in about this. I always talked about how much I loved and valued our relationship, and I praised them constantly. I should also mentioned that I never called either of them overweight, especially knowing that Wendy has and ED.

If I think about what I could have  possibly did to either of them, I did tell Kendra that Wendy and Marcy did not keep Kendra in a school club because she wasn't taking her role seriously (They were all in positions of power). I told Kendra this because she was confused about the situation, and I was never explicitly told that that information was confidential. Of course, I shouldn't have done that regardless, and I recognize that now.

&lt;p&gt;**(CW: extremely brief mention of an ED.) (EDIT: grammatical errors.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past week, my friend group, who I will refer to as Marcy, Kendra, and Wendy (just in case they find this), has been divided. Kendra and I are on the same side, while Wendy and Marcy are on their own side. And just for further context, we are all female, and currently in college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past month, Wendy has been avoiding talking and hanging around me, only coming to me when no one else is available. I saw this as her going through some sort of &amp;quot;mood,&amp;quot; but became suspicious when Marcy slowly began to distance herself from Kendra and I. Both me and Kendra hadn&amp;#39;t talked to either of them in a while, and on the rare occasion we did have a conversation with either of them, they were standoff-ish, dismissive, or just entirely rude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, just recently, we (Kendra and I) decided to address the elephant in the room. Wendy accused us of &amp;quot;not valuing our friendship,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;stressing them out,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ridiculing them by calling them fat and ugly.&amp;quot; Specifically, I was told that I &amp;quot;Ripped apart the friend group,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Now that (i&amp;#39;ve) made my bed, I gotta lie in it.&amp;quot; I haven&amp;#39;t talked to either Wendy or Marcy in the past 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my life I haven&amp;#39;t been able to keep friends around, and I was open to Wendy and Marcy in about this. I always talked about how much I loved and valued our relationship, and I praised them constantly. I should also mentioned that I never called either of them overweight, especially knowing that Wendy has and ED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I think about what I could have  possibly did to either of them, I did tell Kendra that Wendy and Marcy did not keep Kendra in a school club because she wasn&amp;#39;t taking her role seriously (They were all in positions of power).

,AmItheAsshole,"I (F19) and my cousin (F20), let’s call her Mandy, have lived in different cities for most of our lives, up until a year ago when I started attending university in the city she lives in.

We began hanging out and our closeness was rekindled from when we would see each other once a year.

Recently, we went to see a musical in the city together. She invited two of her coworkers which she ran by me beforehand and I was more than okay with it. I was honestly excited to possibly make some new friends since I don’t have a ton in the city I’m currently living in. She painted them as very very chatty people who would talk your ear off, which I was thrilled about because I had hoped that that meant I wouldn’t have to do a ton of talking to engage in conversation and talking to them would be easy.

When we went to the show, we arrived early so we could get a good parking spot. Her coworkers (both guys if that’s important) arrived shortly after. We introduced ourselves to one another and they sat down, making conversation with my Mandy.

They didn’t seem too interested in talking to me but I just caught that it wasn’t the vibe and was chill with it.

The show started and we had a great time. Once the show ended, we parted ways and me and Mandy went to get food and headed back to her place.

We just sat around and chatted for a few hours, when suddenly this conversation took place:

Mandy: I kinda threw you under the bus.

Me: Huh?

Mandy: with my coworkers. I told them that you’re really shy (true) and reserved and that you’d make conversation with them, but you don’t want to talk to them.

Me: oh- huh, what?

Mandy: *laughing the entire time she’s saying this* yeah! Isn’t it so funny? You’ll never see them again!

I stayed silent and laughed along cause I really had no clue what just happened.

She had a vague reason for why she told them that, that being ‘I didn’t want them to be too chatty with you’. Now idk why she would invite them if that were truly the case. She had mentioned that she thinks both of them have a crush on her so I think that had something to do with it.

Once I got home and had time to think about what she said, I was a little hurt by it. Thinking about whether or not they would have talked to me more if she hadn’t said that and if I had missed out on making friends.

But aside from this, she makes a lot of odd comments about my physical features or things I have done in the past (like going on a family trip) or things I have. 

But overall, my cousin doesn’t seem to have much of a filter and it’s really hurtful at times. I don’t know if it’s worth hanging out with her after her doing this.

So, WIBTA if I stopped hanging out with my cousin because she has little to no filter on the things she says?

I'm in the UK, and we have what are called 'community support officers' - AKA 'plastic bobbies'. Basically, they look a bit like uniformed police at a glance, they act a bit like real police officers, but they have very little actual power or authority. Don't have handcuffs, or a baton, no powers of arrest, pretty much glorified security. If they see a crime all they can really do is alert the real police. They act as a deterrent I guess, and save money on real police walking around. 

So, as I'm walking through a local estate, I see the local community officer stood with a young lad I recognise as local, who looks pretty nervous. I walk over and ask what's up. The officer informs me they're waiting for the police to arrive as he suspects the lad may have some cannabis on him so they'll be doing a search. I ask him if he's told this lad he has to stay here and wait for them, to which he says yes I've told him he has to wait until the police arrive to conduct a search. So I tell him well you can't hold him here, you know you can't. I turn to the lad and tell him as much, to just leave, now, he can't hold you here, so jog on. He looks a bit unsure, asks if I'm being serious so I say yea, go, quickly now, he's not allowed to hold you here but the police will so leave before they get here. So he does. The community officer and I then have a chat, all friendly, I actually chat with him quite often so we know each other, I've got respect for what they and the police need to do, but I felt like he was keeping the boy there under false pretenses and that's just not on. He tells me I shouldn't have told him he could go, I tell him he shouldn't have not told him. So, given the situation, AITA for letting the lad know his rights, and that he was free to go?

,AmItheAsshole,"Basically just the title. So I have a few irl friends, about 10 of us or so. We’re all in a group chat together so that we can still talk if we don’t have time to hang out in person. This one guy in the gc, who we were all friends with, started saying racist things. Like how white people and other races being together doesn’t look good, how he wouldn’t date someone that isn’t the same race as him, that he doesn’t find other races attractive, stuff like that. 


He’s mentioned his preferences a few times in the past but I didn’t say anything about it, because I didn’t want to cause unnecessary drama. But this time I decided to just be like “hey what you’re saying is kinda hurtful (I’m not white and I’m one of the only non-white people) especially since not everyone in this group is white.” Tried explaining to him how it was hurtful. He got angry/sad/embarassed and left the group chat, then got added back, 2 hours later or so. 


A few days later he DM’ed me to apologize. He said he was sorry that I felt that way (in regards to being hurt), that he didn’t think his personal preferences were hurtful and that he thought I don’t always get sensitive like other people, that I shouldn’t take it personally, and that it’s not his fault because his family raised him that way. I personally don’t think that saying “I’m sorry you feel that way” is a real/sincere apology, so I got angry and responded in a not so great way. Basically I said “sure whatever that’s fine just leave me alone, I’m already having a bad day.” Which was true tbh.


Then life went on, like a few weeks or so. One of our friends told me that they tried explaining to him how what he said was wrong, but he got angry again and blocked a few of us. Including me. So they decided to compromise and move on because he’s not going to change his mind. I told them, what he said was hurtful and it’s hurtful that you guys would move on just because he won’t change his mind. That he needs to learn how to accept constructive criticism. They then told me I need to move on from the situation. 


Just three days ago, I left the group chat and blocked most of them because I was frustrated and sad that they took him back, and also what they said. So AITA for blocking these friends or was my action justified? I’m just trying to look for some unbiased opinions, thank you. 


Edit 1: thank you everyone for the responses. It means a lot

edit 2: this is how we got on the topic of racism in the first place: we were talking about school and he was saying there’s only 2 girls in one of his class (he’s in a male dominated area of studies), one of whom he said wears really revealing clothing. he said he wouldn’t wanna date her because of that, which is ok and then he mentioned how she’s coloured too and he doesn’t go for that. so someone asked him to elaborate, he then said how coloured and white peoole don’t mix down in the south and it just looks wrong, it’s better for whites to date only whites, and all the other stuff i mentioned in the post.

,AmItheAsshole,"Sis and BIL live in my finished basement with their toddler. A bathroom was installed downstairs so that we all wouldn't have to share that space. (I have an 8 yr old) The upflush tank is for the toilet, shower, and a basin sink outside the bathroom.

There is no lease. A family member owns the house but it was purchased for my child and I, and for the future/in the will. I let Sis &amp; BIL move in once they had their baby because they needed to get on their feet. Now 4 yrs later I am DONE with not only this issue but so many others.

I pay 50% of mortgage and 50% utils, while they each make more than I do, and together only have 50% of the mortgage, and 50% utils. BIL just spent over 3K on a trip to see family. Meanwhile, I still have to share my bathroom because they won't fix theirs. I do all the yard work, house repairs, clean their messes (and stare at their pile of junk) in the garage. Just examples from many issues.

They broke the upflush tank months after it was installed, because a bolt felt down their sink drain. And they are not keeping the plug in the sink drain to avoid this. I paid in full almost $600 to get it fixed because they were dragging their feet.

Now the tank is broken again. This time, a bobby pin was lodged in the fan inside the tank. Unlike last time, the motor is burnt out with them trying to fix themselves, so it's approx $1500 to replace/install. It's been 6 months and they still have not fixed it. I told them I'm not paying a DIME, as they were responsible for the damage. This means they are in my space to do dishes (at very late times when im trying to relax) and using my bathroom.

However, they have been using my things, going through TP without contributing, the shower gets filthy now. One time I found many many hairs ALL OVER the tub if you know what I mean, with MY scissors on the edge of the tub and my razor used. I was disgusted, and had to clean it up because she didn't!! My things get rearranged or go missing, everything knocked off my shower shelves with all the stuff in the bottom of the tub. I also have a kitten, so for now the litter box is in the bathroom until it's older. They just move it into the living room, complaining they don't like it in there when they shower. It's cleaned regularly, and they also got a kitten who is mostly upstairs in my space (not by my preference) and uses the litter box too. They haven't once helped change the Litterbox their kitten also uses, just shove it outside because they're too good to shower with it in there or clean it if they don't like it. 

WIBTA if I gave them a date and said after that date I am installing a lock on the bathroom door?? This is in the hopes of getting them to fix the tank they broke so they can use their bathroom again. Is it illegal if there is no lease but just family members not wanting to pay up for their carelessness? 

I am feeling trapped in my home due to this amongst many other things. I am at my wits end.

Meanwhile, I still have to share my bathroom because they won&amp;#39;t fix theirs. I do all the yard work, house repairs, clean their messes (and stare at their pile of junk) in the garage. Just examples from many issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They broke the upflush tank months after it was installed, because a bolt felt down their sink drain. And they are not keeping the plug in the sink drain to avoid this. I paid in full almost $600 to get it fixed because they were dragging their feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the tank is broken again. This time, a bobby pin was lodged in the fan inside the tank. Unlike last time, the motor is burnt out with them trying to fix themselves, so it&amp;#39;s approx $1500 to replace/install. It&amp;#39;s been 6 months and they still have not fixed it. I told them I&amp;#39;m not paying a DIME, as they were responsible for the damage. This means they are in my space to do dishes (at very late times when im trying to relax) and using my bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they have been using my things, going through TP without contributing, the shower gets filthy now. One time I found many many hairs ALL OVER the tub if you know what I mean, with MY scissors on the edge of the tub and my razor used. I was disgusted, and had to clean it up because she didn&amp;#39;t!! My things get rearranged or go missing, everything knocked off my shower shelves with all the stuff in the bottom of the tub. I also have a kitten, so for now the litter box is in the bathroom until it&amp;#39;s older. They just move it into the living room, complaining they don&amp;#39;t like it in there when they shower. It&amp;#39;s cleaned regularly, and they also got a kitten who is mostly upstairs in my space (not by my preference) and uses the litter box too. They haven&amp;#39;t once helped change the Litterbox their kitten also uses, just shove it outside because they&amp;#39;re too good to shower with it in there or clean it if they don&amp;#39;t like it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WIBTA if I gave them a date and said after that date I am installing a lock on the bathroom door?? This is in the hopes of getting them to fix the tank they broke so they can use their bathroom again. Is it illegal if there is no lease but just family members not wanting to pay up for their carelessness? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am feeling trapped in my home due to this amongst many other things. I am at my wits end.&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"Long story short, I lied about the reason I wouldn't give an interview to a friend who is a journalist, but then felt bad and explained my true motive later that day. He was deeply upset and unfriended me. While I do feel bad and know I did wrong, I didn't think that what I did was *that* egregiously bad/that it merited the reaction it got. What do you all think?

The conversation:

Him: Want to be interviewed for my election story? You're very opionated!

Me: Potentially! Flattered by the offer

Him: *various questions*

Me: sure, I can answer those!

About 20 mins later...

Me: Acc I need to retract this yes. Looking over the permissions from work/advisable behavior it is unclear I should be doing this

Him: can you ask your workplace?

Me: yeah but it'd be too slow, not worth it

Me: Apologies. I shouldn't have said yes before looking over my permissions

Him: *silly joke*

Twelve hours later:

Me: This is actually eating at me a bit, as I consider myself an honest person and don't want to mislead. So I want to correct myself - I haven't really checked my work permissions, it may be okay, it may not. But I checked with one of the other *campaign side job* people I'm working with as I know I tend to overshare and wanted to sanity check my judgement. They recommended I don't do this interview, I assume given the slant of the publication but the truth is I didn't really pry on why. I apologize for lying, this was far more awkward to explain so I avoided it, but that was the wrong and dishonest choice

Him: Slant of our outelt? We're down-the-middle -- you didn't even do your research, dude.

Him: And lying to me is not okay, nyfe99. I have zero tolerance for lying.

Me: I apologize, it wasn't cool. I'm really sorry.

Him: I can't be friends with those who lie. I'm sorry. Lying is a red line.

Me: Okay.

Him: And the *campaign side job* people should do their research before making up stuff about my outlet.

Me: What? No one said your outlet had a slant.

Him: ""They recommended I don't do this interview, I assume given the slant of the publication.""

Me: I just asked, the person said don't do it, I didn't ask questions. I said ""I assume"". The truth is I don't actually know.

Him: You assumed we have a slant? Well, we don't.

Me: good to know! But either way, I was told no.

Him: Lying crosses the line for me. Good luck, Noah.

Me: I messed up, and if you're approach is generally a ""fool me once, ..."" one, I can respect that. 
But I will defend my reputation. I am an honest person, to the best of my ability, as those who know me will attest. I am okay with you dissociating with me on the grounds that I lied, but I will not let myself be called a *liar*.

,AmItheAsshole,"Background: my friend (let’s call her light) gave me a tattoo when I was about 14 or so. It was a lover/loser tattoo from it and a ghost. It was on my chest and VERY visible when I would wear tank tops or any lower cut shirt. I told her when she was doing it that I would get it covered up since she was practicing. (Yes I know that’s stupid to let her practice on me but I was a young dumb teenager.) The letters were all wonky and it curved downwards. Both tattoos were poorly done and very patchy. I hated those tattoos for years and I was honestly embarrassed to have them shown when I would wear lower cut shirts. For about two years I was talking about what I was going to get it covered with and what tattoo artists I was thinking of. She knew that I wanted to get these covered and I would when it would be a good time for me. 

Now I’m 17 and decided with the cooler weather out and the fact I would be wearing regular shirts and jackets I decided that now would be a good time to get it covered since I could have it properly heal without getting hot from wearing long sleeves and full shirts that would protect it from the sun. I found an artist that I found trusted because she had done multiple of my friend’s work and they were all so beautiful. I went to get the tattoo done and it came out absolutely beautiful. I got a lotus flower because it is one of my favorite flowers. Light and I haven’t talked since early August and that was because I reached out first. We don’t speak often and don’t unless I reach out first. In September, her brother reached out saying that it was f’ed up and saying I was disrespectful since I got her tattoo covered up saying that I should have asked her. I shut it down real quick and said that I have talked to her about it and we haven’t talked in months. I told him that she should have reached out to me and I was not going to be communicating through him. Her and I haven’t talked had problems because and I’ve distanced myself from her quite a bit because she has always been kind of off. Things like leaving me out when we have another friend over, her always having to be the center of attention, storming off when I talk to someone else for more than a minute, giving backhanded compliments, putting me down, etc. I have found it not enjoyable to be around her and therefore I have not. She is almost 18 years old and she still asked like she did when we first met in 2019.

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m 17 and decided with the cooler weather out and the fact I would be wearing regular shirts and jackets I decided that now would be a good time to get it covered since I could have it properly heal without getting hot from wearing long sleeves and full shirts that would protect it from the sun. I found an artist that I found trusted because she had done multiple of my friend’s work and they were all so beautiful. I went to get the tattoo done and it came out absolutely beautiful. I got a lotus flower because it is one of my favorite flowers. Light and I haven’t talked since early August and that was because I reached out first. We don’t speak often and don’t unless I reach out first. In September, her brother reached out saying that it was f’ed up and saying I was disrespectful since I got her tattoo covered up saying that I should have asked her. I shut it down real quick and said that I have talked to her about it and we haven’t talked in months. I told him that she should have reached out to me and I was not going to be communicating through him. Her and I haven’t talked had problems because and I’ve distanced myself from her quite a bit because she has always been kind of off. Things like leaving me out when we have another friend over, her always having to be the center of attention, storming off when I talk to someone else for more than a minute, giving backhanded compliments, putting me down, etc. I have found it not enjoyable to be around her and therefore I have not. She is almost 18 years old and she still asked like she did when we first met in 2019. I’ve been thinking about this more lately because her birthday is coming up and I do want to reach out but I don’t know if that would be a good idea. AITA? &lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"Happened earlier today at my regular card shop with some friends.

For context: My Girlfriend and I started playing Lorcana in July-I have previous TCG experience in YuGiOh back in 2013-2017 but got back recently in 2023 since my favorite archetype was getting support (Raidraptors woo), but this her first TCG. She's gotten better since we first started and we have close games at times, but I typically win due to deckbuilding/decision-making, and would occasionally&lt;&gt;frequently remind her of effects she may miss/misinterpret which is understandable and I'm okay with helping her. At the local shop they run Lorcana pretty casually so regardless if you win/lose you get 'points', but I still like to be competitive and try. When I get locked in I have the habit of RBF, which is good for competition but catches her off guard sometimes. When we usually play each other, if I were to realize she has game, I would tell her so we could get into the next game quickly.

Now for the story: We are 1-1 in a best of 3, and she is in a position to win if she 'quests' (gains points) with all of her characters currently on the board. I notice this during my previous turn and I didn't want to show it via my face so I kept a blank expression. However she did not see her winning board and instead did 3-4 actions/moves until she finally realized, and asked if she could take them back so she could win. Because I wanted to win, I said no, sarcastically saying that she made too many moves and couldn't reset it even though we really could have. She started to get upset but played along a bit, making comments to my other friends sitting next to us saying how mean I was for taking it so seriously, which made me feel like an ass even though she missed her win condition. I doubled down on not resetting her turn and when it got to mine, I ended up having the exact number of points on my field for the win and took the game/match. After a little she got up to use the bathroom and was gone for 5 minutes, and when she came back her eyes were a little watery, but she kept herself composed, and we played some other people before heading home. In my head I was beating myself up over it, but part of me was coping that by not being as lenient, that it'd help her be a better player to check her board/effects like how I've experienced when learning to play TCGs especially modern YuGiOh (it's awful). We talked in the car and she said she wasn't upset at me, moreso at herself for not counting her field, telling me she'd excused herself after the last game as to not cry in front of people due to her tending to let out her emotions through crying and didn't want to embarass herself/me. After talking through it/communicating our feelings we made up and everything is okay/settled.

She has not had a job in over 14 years and has no plan to change that. I've managed to work multiple jobs and live in homeless shelters with her throughout high school.

She then went on to receive standard social benefits (much less than disability and not even close to livable wage).

,AmItheAsshole,"Hi! English isn’t my first language, so I apologize for any mistakes. 
I (F18) have been best friends with Alan (M18) for 15 years we’re like siblings and always respect each other’s boundaries, especially when dating. I also have a friend, Helena (F19), who I’ve known for three years. We met in high school when she was having a tough time, and I introduced her to my friend group. Eventually, she met Alan and saw our friendship dynamic.
About a year ago, Helena felt left out because most of our group, including me, was dating. She’d only had one relationship in middle school and complained about wanting a boyfriend. I knew she found Alan attractive, so I asked him what he thought. He was open to trying but later realized they weren’t compatible, as her passive-aggressive flirting made him uncomfortable. Helena grew frustrated, and when he told her he wasn’t interested, she blamed me for setting them up.
Things got tense. Helena would try spending time with Alan, him feeling uncomfortable, started sticking with me when she was around, which made me uneasy. When I started dating someone new, she suddenly accused me of not deserving him and hinted I’d likely cheat because I’d had casual “situationships” before. 

Later, Alan told me Helena had questioned why he’d prefer me over her, implying she was better because of her wealth and status. I tried treating her normally, but she stayed distant. We had another clash during a game when I got distracted, and she overreacted, turning her strategy to ruin my game. Afterward, I talked to some friends about the situation, but now I feel guilty, as it reminds me of how her old friend group treated her.
Helena is now ghosting me, and I feel bad for talking to our friends, but I don’t know how else to handle this. I’m wondering if pushing her and Alan together started all this, even though my intentions were good.

I (F18) have been best friends with Alan (M18) for 15 years we’re like siblings and always respect each other’s boundaries, especially when dating. I also have a friend, Helena (F19), who I’ve known for three years. We met in high school when she was having a tough time, and I introduced her to my friend group. Eventually, she met Alan and saw our friendship dynamic.
About a year ago, Helena felt left out because most of our group, including me, was dating. She’d only had one relationship in middle school and complained about wanting a boyfriend. I knew she found Alan attractive, so I asked him what he thought. He was open to trying but later realized they weren’t compatible, as her passive-aggressive flirting made him uncomfortable. Helena grew frustrated, and when he told her he wasn’t interested, she blamed me for setting them up.
Things got tense. Helena would try spending time with Alan, him feeling uncomfortable, started sticking with me when she was around, which made me uneasy. When I started dating someone new, she suddenly accused me of not deserving him and hinted I’d likely cheat because I’d had casual “situationships” before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, Alan told me Helena had questioned why he’d prefer me over her, implying she was better because of her wealth and status. I tried treating her normally, but she stayed distant. We had another clash during a game when I got distracted, and she overreacted, turning her strategy to ruin my game. Afterward, I talked to some friends about the situation, but now I feel guilty, as it reminds me of how her old friend group treated her.
Helena is now ghosting me, and I feel bad for talking to our friends, but I don’t know how else to handle this. I’m wondering if pushing her and Alan together started all this, even though my intentions were good. AITA for setting up my best friend with my friend?&lt;/p&gt;

,AmItheAsshole,"My ex-wife and I divorced about two years ago after being together for about 10 years. It was a really rough divorce. I won't get too into it here but we had many problems through our entire marriage, some from her, most from me if I'm being honest. Near the end I had an emotional affair which was the final nail in the coffin. We've been no contact ever since, years of radio silence. It was a long, rough couple years but I would say I'm mostly healed now. I never tried to contact her ever, no matter how tempted I was to write her an apology. But I'm ashamed to admit that once a month or so I check in on a tiktok account she made for our (now her) pets, a dog and two cats. I just need to see if they're doing okay. I look at the page, confirm they're still alive and healthy, and I exit the page. I know this isn't really okay or healthy for me, but I've never tried to contact her so I'm not harming her. Unfortunately somethings changed and I don't know what to do.

When I checked the page yesterday, there was a new pinned post concerning one of the cats, we'll call him Oliver. Oliver has always had urinary tract problems, and occasionally kidney stones, but it seems recently he's had more severe issues and my ex-wife has incurred a 4000 dollar vet bill getting him treatment. If he doesn't get better he'll possibly need an 8000 dollar surgery or be put down. My ex-wife has started a gofundme to cover the 4000 dollar bill, she says any extra will go toward the surgery. As you can imagine, she's not getting too much, a few hundred dollars from friend and family total over the last couple weeks. 

Now I think under normal circumstances she'd want me to stay as far away from her as possible. And I'm 50/50 on if she'd take any money from me even if it's just for the cat. But I straight up can't stand by and do nothing. I love that cat so, so much, and even though things ended badly between us I have always wished the best for my ex-wife. The idea of just sitting here on my ass while the cat we adopted together dies and she takes the financial burden on all by herself just makes me so upset that I can't stop crying. I sent her a text trying to reach out asking for permission to donate, which terrified me but I didn't know what else to do. I have no doubt I'm long blocked, even if I'm not there has been no response so far. 

Now I've thought of a way to donate completely anonymously by using gift cards, but that just feels weird. But donating normally and her seeing it's from me also feels like a terrible idea. And of course, just doing nothing feels the most wrong of all to me.

Wanna try and keep  this as to the point and as short as possible. I (30 male) and my mother have never had a good relationship. The years of of just crap has made it virtually impossible for us to have any sort of civil relationship. I wanna be clear i am not completely innocent and I am willing to admit that. I was an angry temperamental teen and made ALOT of mistakes. She has also done a lot of wrong towards me as well the difference is, ive admitted my short comings and worked to change and repair damage I've done. In her mind she is ""mom"" so she deserves respect no matter what and feels like I owe it to her even though I've been homeless and she made it clear she didn't care because I'm ""just like my father"".  I've been a dad since I was 17 and without going into the crap she has tried to pull with my kid recently he had a birthday. Again while I have no interest in speaking to my mother I never stop her from being a grandmother to my kid (provided she doesn't try toxic BS). She texted me and wished him a happy birthday and he texted back ""thank you phone grandma"" she called upset *my phone was on speaker, I dont trust her enough to give her my kids number* and yelled ""what the fu** does phone grandma mean"" and my kid politely told her ""I have my grandma on my mom's side who i see all the time, I have my poppops wife who is my grandma who visits when she can, and then you as my phone grandma who calls twice a year on Christmas and my birthday"" i stepped before she said something that would make me lose my temper and she said that ""I'm your mother which means I'm his grandmother more then your dad's wife how dare you let him disrespect me like that"" and I told her ""I've never made my kid feel obligated to ""blood"" you earn titles you have in my sons life he has ""uncles"" through me that he knows aren't blood but have shown up in some hard times for him. If you don't have a title from my son it's because you didn't earn or maintain it and that sounds like a you problem not a me problem"" she started screaming and i hung up. My uncle (bio on dad's side) called me and said ""look I get it she hurt you and did a lot of things and even disrespected your grandfather but you only get one mom man, you know how close you were with grandpa dont you want that for your kid?"" My response was ""if she wants the love and respect of a mom and grandmother she needs to earn it"" and he said ""well she did raise you"" and I go ""well she did what she WAS LEGALLY REQUIRED TO DO, she CHOSE TO HAVE ME AND NOT GIVE ME UP FOR ADOPTION so her keeping my alive until I was 16 when she through me out doesn't warrant a parade!!"" I hung up. My wife came to me and said ""look I get it, I don't like your mom anymore then you do but you didn't have to be THAT hurtful to either of them.

,AmItheAsshole,"I have an ex, N, who was very wealthy, and she knew I liked fashion, so she bought a lot of presents for me. These included a gold chain, gold rings, a Tom Ford cardholder, a Cartier watch, lots of clothes, cologne, etc. To clarify, I didn't ask for these presents and actively told her I didn't need them, but she gave them to me nevertheless, and they're nice presents so I accepted. 

She and I broke up, and I'm dating a new girl, H, now. The split with N was amicable and we're still friendly, and besides, I'm a mostly broke college student and can't afford to replace the stuff she got me, so I kept it. 

H takes issue to me wearing stuff an ex got for me and says that it's disrespectful to her. I don't think it's that deep.

,AmItheAsshole,"Over the past week my fiancée (34F) has been hinting towards a plan she has been working on for this upcoming weekend to celebrate my birthday.

Whenever we make plans, we like to keep them secret from the other person so it's more of a surprise in the moment. Then today, she called and asked me if we could go to the Billie Eilish concert on my actual birthday. She then told me that another option we could do was go and see the concert during the celebration weekend, but they would be more expensive so she would need me to pay for half the price of the tickets. Both concerts are a 2hour drive away.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely enjoy going to concerts with her, but we both have dramatically different tastes in music and I honestly would prefer to just have a lazy day for my birthday. At first I agreed and said we could go on my actual birthday.

However, this kind of upset me and when she called me back later I suggested that maybe she could go with one of her friends and I could just stay home and be lazy or hangout with my brother. She responded by telling me that I was being selfish.

My instant reaction was to say that she was the one being selfish. I regret this and wish I hadn't said it, I foolishly let my emotions take hold. She then proceeded to tell me that I was being ungrateful and how much she had planned the weekend and then broke our surprise tradition by telling me all of the plans she had made for the weekend.

I got home after work and told her I was sorry that I got upset and told her that I would go to the concert with her on my birthday, but she no longer wants to go. I guess I was just upset overall because I wanted my birthday to be a day that made me feel like I was the most important person for a day, so maybe I am just selfish.

Update: We talked about the situation and how we both feel. A lot of it came down to cultural differences in how we both grew up celebrating our birthdays as we both come from different countries. Also, there were some misunderstandings when it came to the price of the concert and what the overall time line would look like. The timeline part is really because of our tradition of doing surprises, but we truly enjoy celebrating that way and we’ll never stop that, so anyone who said that’s dumb can sit on yogurt.

When I was still living with my mother, I was struggling with an eating disorder which made me pretty skinny, but not super thin either. My mom constantly has smug remarks about what I eat and about my body, that since I was 11. For exemple, I loved eating a nutella toast after souper instead of a normal desert, and each time I did she would look at me with a judgmental look and say: 

""You should take more veggies if your still hungry, you shouldn't eat all that sugar if you want to stay thin""

 or : 

""You're eating again? You ate so much already! Maybe you should keep it at that"" 

This made me feel like eating was shameful and that people would see me as a pig if I ate in front of them.

""You got pretty fat, you should stop eating all that junk"".

""What the f is wrong with you! Fat shaming your kid? Good job mom, then you wonder why I haven't been visiting much!""

And stormed to my room where my sister(12F) reassured me. My mom did come to apologize but right after added:

,AmItheAsshole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons...

So, here’s the situation. I (30M) have a sister, ""Laura"" (32F), who has a son, ""Jake"" (8M). Laura and her husband are both busy professionals, and I get that life can be hectic. But lately, I’ve been really concerned about how they’re raising Jake.

Last week, I went over to their house for dinner. After dinner, it was a typical evening for their household: Laura was on her phone half the time, and her husband was glued to the TV. Meanwhile, Jake was playing video games in the other room, completely ignored. At one point, I went to check on him, and he was watching some ridiculous YouTube video about pranks. I was shocked and called Laura into the room to show her what he was watching.

Her reaction? She brushed it off, saying he was “just being a kid” and that I was overreacting. I couldn't believe it. This is the kind of stuff that can really mess up a kid’s head! So, I got a bit heated and told her that the reason this happened in the first place was because she had a kid too young, and that if she’s not going to pay attention to him, she shouldn’t be surprised when he ends up getting hurt, acting out, or having weird political beliefs. I said, “You’re a terrible parent if you can’t even be bothered to monitor what your kid is watching.”

Let's just say, that didn’t go over well at all. Laura got upset and started crying like she usually does and called me an ""arrogant know-it-all."" I couldn't help but laugh (I usually do in uncomfortable situations). Her husband backed her up, saying I had no idea what it’s like to raise a kid. But honestly, I couldn’t just sit back and be complicit in this any longer. They need to hear the truth!

Now, my parents are caught in the middle and think I was too harsh and are threatening to kick me out, which would *literally* make me homeless. They’re saying I should have kept my mouth shut and just enjoyed dinner. But I feel like if I don’t say something, who will? Will no one stand up for what's right anymore?
