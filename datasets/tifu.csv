I’m sure you can sense where this is going. Over the weekend I’d eaten some spicy Thai food, which you know, has its own downsides.

I’ve got no chance to do anything else but writhe in pain for the next 30 minutes. 

It wasn’t until later that day when I go to help my kid with their teeth that I see the toothpaste uncapped on the counter. The wiping foam is nowhere to be seen in the bathroom.

,tifu,"So my mum has been pushing me and my dad to get our hair cut recently. Neither of our hair is as long as we usually have it by the time we get it cut. My dad decided he didn't want to pay for a hairdresser to do it and got me to do it instead.

Today was going pretty normally until my dad asked me to cut his hair, which was fine, I have done it once or twice before, particularly once in the pandemic. He was being pretty pushy about getting it done early today but it's whatever, that's kinda what he's like. 

So I ended up doing it in our back garden, got the back and the ears done, really just needed to trim down the top of his hair a bit and he would have been done probably. 

Now my dad is in his 60's and he's gone grey, but his hair growth has not slowed down significantly, he still grows it at a decent rate. That's important for this next bit.

Also probably worth noting I'm probably a little autistic, and care a lot less than most people about what random people on the street think, butttt I was thinking he's retired, he's not got to go to anything too important, anytime soon... Fuck it sounds like a good time to play a bit of a practical joke on him... 

*So I put the shaver at the top of his head, and shaved straight forwards*

It was funny in the moment, it really was, buuuuut after a couple of seconds he realised the significance of it and reminded me that he is going on holiday for a week in a few weeks, which I had forgotten about...

So he told me to get my mum to try and fix it, so I sent her down and tbh I think she laughed for longer than I did, I don't think I've ever heard her laugh so hard. But after she stopped laughing and I came downstairs to try and help it was immediately clear that he was pretty upset by the whole thing, even crying which is maybe the 3rd time I've ever seen him cry, which really pissed my mum off for obvious reasons.

After I left them to it again, she talked with a few friends who have relatives who are hairdressers and unsurprisingly, he probably has to go bald really. He might have not minded being bald, had he had a choice in the matter, but he definitely did not like the idea of it when i suggested it not long after. 

My mum told me to get out and get my hair done at a hairdressers before they do the same to me, which he might not be willing to do but she definitely would. 

So that's where I'm going right now. Thinking of having mine cut particularly short as a bit of an apology. 

He should be fine, apparently average hair growth is half a inch per month, so give it a month and it'll just look short, by Christmas it should look neat.

,tifu,"This is a small TIFU, but a fu none the less.  

I’m in a situationship with my on again off again boyfriend.  This time around we decided to take things slow and be friends.  As it turns out we are best friends and get along great.  

Yesterday after work he came by to take care of me because I wasn’t feeling well.  He made me dinner and we laid in bed watching tv.  I finally started to feel better and asked if he wanted a back rub as a reward for doting on me the last few days.  He enthusiastically agreed.  

I just treated myself to new lotion from bath and body works so I grabbed the bottles and had him smell them to pick his favorite.  It was dark, the only light was from the tv.  I slathered him with the lotion thick because it smelled so good. Gave him an amazing back rub and we both fell asleep.  

This morning at 6 am he woke up realizing he fell asleep at my place, and was late for work.  Not wanting to wake me he got up and threw on clothes in the dark and left.  

A side note is he is a foreman for a large tree company.  He works with a bunch of dudes and they are all manly and will tease each other endlessly.  

When I finally woke up, I was confused because it looked like my hands were covered in gold sparkly paint.  I finally figured it out that for some reason the lotion had thick gold glitter in it.  

I text him to alert him that he was covered in very noticeable glitter but I was too late, the boys have already noticed.  It’s two hours into his work day and the teasing as only just began.  He messaged me back that this probably makes us official as the crew will never let him live this down and I’ve officially marked my territory.  

TLDR- gave my situationship a back rub in the dark not realizing the new lotion I used has lots of glitter in it, he woke up late, threw on clothes, and went to work covered in very noticeable gold glitter.

,tifu,"tldr at the bottom.  This happened about a decade ago, and something else I was just reading reminded me of it so I thought I'd share.

I had just moved into a new place about a week prior.  I was renting a bedroom in a small house, and the only other person who lived there was the owner.  It was a great setup for me, because his work schedule and social life meant I was often the only person home.  As such, for the first time in years, my music-loving self could set up a decent pair of speakers and a subwoofer and listen to music at levels that would be pretty inconsiderate in a shared space, but not screamingly loud or anything.  Well, the subwoofer itself was pretty much turned all the way up, but that's because it was much smaller than the other speakers, so that was how I got it to be at an appropriate match.  This setup was in my bedroom, not a shared space.

One night, I was listening to music while lying in bed.  It turned into one of those nights where I went from wired to tired pretty quickly, and so I just hit the remote for the stereo to turn it off before passing out.  That doesn't turn the subwoofer off, but whatever, I'm not worried about the couple of pennies it'll cost to keep that thing running overnight.  

I was worried, however, at about 2:00AM when I suddenly heard someone screaming in my bedroom.  In my utterly discombobulated state, it took me a few seconds to realize that the screaming was coming through my subwoofer.  I double checked, and my stereo was off.  

As I relayed this to someone at work the next day, they asked where my new place was.  When I told them, they started laughing.  They said ""when you go home tonight, take a look at the house next to yours.  And take a look at their back yard.""

I get home that night, and what do I find?  Behind their modest ranch house is a 30' tall antenna mast that apparently everyone in town knew about except for me.  Turns out the guy is an amateur radio hobbyist who loved playing with CB and ham radio equipment.  And my crappy thrift-store subwoofer was picking up his transmissions because of the way things were wired.

,tifu,"So, for context, we had known eachother for only a short time before this, but the relationship between us had developed very quickly and you could possibly even have called it ”love at first sight”. 

Then some complications appeared, because she had been planning to move to a different country in under a year’s time, which shook me a lot. I felt very depressed about the fact that me and her could never last, but I still wanted to experience knowing her even if it was only for a few months. The feeling was not mutual.

So today, after our relationship had started falling apart a couple of days ago, I decided to go wait outside her apartment for her to come home. My thoughts prior to this were just to talk to her, straighten everything out between us, decide what we’re gonna do going forward and then maybe say our goodbyes and never speak again. 

My mistake, however, was that I had not thought at all about how it’s gonna feel like to her to see me standing outside of her house unannounced if our feelings about talking aren’t mutual. I was so blinded by my feelings for her that I hadn’t thought about the possibility that she doesn’t want to see me again.

So she walked to her street and we met. Our conversation was very short and didn’t really have any meaning. The whole time she looked so uncomfortable and scared, and at that point it started to sink in what I really had done. She just finished the conversation quickly and walked inside.

I instantly felt sick to my stomach thinking about what had just happened. I had really just stood outside someones house imagining that my romantic feelings we’re going to be mutual with that person. I feel so terrible about the fact that I probably made her fear for her life or for her wellbeing by just wanting to talk to her. This goes against everything and anything I have ever thought or expected of myself and I feel absolutely disgusting right now. I can’t believe I have actually done something like this.

Even though my meaning really was only to talk to her and have a discussion about how we’re gonna end things between us, I can’t help but to feel like an absolute creep and harasser. I’m a very emotional and caring person, so it’s really hard for me to believe I have just done something that probably terrified the person I really cared about and had feelings for. I just walked away quickly, removed her number, blocked her on every social media and swore I would never be in contact with her again or do anything like this ever again. 

I’m so fucking disappointed in myself. I can not believe I could make someone feel that way and not even think about it as a possibility beforehand. I feel like a creep, a stalker, and a harasser, and I don’t know if I will ever forgive myself for doing something so stupid like this.

I had really just stood outside someones house imagining that my romantic feelings we’re going to be mutual with that person. I feel so terrible about the fact that I probably made her fear for her life or for her wellbeing by just wanting to talk to her. This goes against everything and anything I have ever thought or expected of myself and I feel absolutely disgusting right now. I can’t believe I have actually done something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though my meaning really was only to talk to her and have a discussion about how we’re gonna end things between us, I can’t help but to feel like an absolute creep and harasser. I’m a very emotional and caring person, so it’s really hard for me to believe I have just done something that probably terrified the person I really cared about and had feelings for. I just walked away quickly, removed her number, blocked her on every social media and swore I would never be in contact with her again or do anything like this ever again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so fucking disappointed in myself. I can not believe I could make someone feel that way and not even think about it as a possibility beforehand. I feel like a creep, a stalker, and a harasser, and I don’t know if I will ever forgive myself for doing something so stupid like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to talk to my situationship but ended up looking like a creepy stalker because of my own stupidity and ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

So, today was supposed to be the day of my French oral exam. My partner left her place super early, like 7 AM to get in a bus just to get there in time. I was feeling a little nervous but figured it’d go fine because we’d practiced… well, mostly. I mean, I could mumble my way through French at least, right?

Wrong.

We get in there, and the second the prof starts asking questions my brain blanks out, like completely blank and I’m just sitting there, I managed to answer one question then I stared at my partner who came all this way, who was probably wondering why tshe bothered asking me to work with her. The prof keeps looking at me but but all I can say is Uhhh

So after this endless, painful silence, the prof lets us off the hook. Reschedules it, gives me a chance to pull myself together… but the shame? Oh, it’s real. The girl (who I have somewhat developed a crush on) was super nice about it but the guilt is already in full swing and she probably thinks I’m an idiot.

,tifu,"Today is kinda bad. I got a job interview on Tuesday. A guy who interviewed me seemed eager to have me on the team. He mentioned a lot about workload, work environment, him wanted to expand the team and moved to other position within the company, or even wanted to take me to for a tour around the office. Then when he asked if I had any questions, I told him that it probably worked if he gave me the assignment to see if I’m a ‘good fit’. He seemed excited no one has ever asked him anything like that before. Then after I left the interview, he sent me an email with an assignment with the deadline on 5pm Thursday.

I stayed up all night from 7pm to 4.30 am to do the assignment. At 1pm Wednesday the HR called to confirm that I received the email and asked about the progress. At 4.30pm I sent the assignment to him and he said he would give me a feedback today.

And today at 11am, he sent me an email confirming that the company would not proceed with my application. He confirmed it wasn’t about assignment he gave me in which he valued and appreciated.

I don’t know. I called it bullshit. If it wasn’t about the assignment then what would it be? And I just thought why wouldn’t I just scam the shit out of him at least for a month? Why did I just go an extra mile to prove my honesty and want the best for everyone? Why didn’t he just tell me that the work didn’t meet the criteria and he wished me the best of luck?

Me M19 A little while ago hooked up with my friends ex gf and i didn’t think much of it until recently. They were broken up and I talked to her about it and she told me how their relationship got toxic and how he treated her bad and i didn’t really say much to that and everything. one weekend she came to a bar in town with a couple of her friends and we ended up hanging that night in a group having drinks. We ended up getting drunk and somehow hooked up at the end of the night which wasn’t really expected. One thing I forgot to ask before all of this was if he still had feelings for her and Apparently he does and thats when i realized i fucked up. I haven’t talked to tjhis friend or hung out with him in over a year, but he is a really close friend and I honestly regretted it so much. To be honest i don’t even know what she was thinking either but in the end i think i’m the one that messed up here. Anyways me and her agreed to not let him find out and just never do that again, but i think somehow he recently found out and he just randomly called me 3 times. Idk if he found out or not, but I have a strong feeling he did and I don’t really know how
to approach this situation.  I feel like lying to him bc i already didn’t talk to him about it, but at the same time i feel like telling the truth might be the better option.

They were broken up and I talked to her about it and she told me how their relationship got toxic and how he treated her bad and i didn’t really say much to that and everything. one weekend she came to a bar in town with a couple of her friends and we ended up hanging that night in a group having drinks. We ended up getting drunk and somehow hooked up at the end of the night which wasn’t really expected. One thing I forgot to ask before all of this was if he still had feelings for her and Apparently he does and thats when i realized i fucked up. I haven’t talked to tjhis friend or hung out with him in over a year, but he is a really close friend and I honestly regretted it so much. To be honest i don’t even know what she was thinking either but in the end i think i’m the one that messed up here. Anyways me and her agreed to not let him find out and just never do that again, but i think somehow he recently found out and he just randomly called me 3 times. Idk if he found out or not, but I have a strong feeling he did and I don’t really know how
to approach this situation.  I feel like lying to him bc i already didn’t talk to him about it, but at the same time i feel like telling the truth might be the better option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I hooked up with one of my friends exes and I think he found out and I don’t know how to approach thr situation&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"Today I fucked up. 

Obligatory not today, but recently (for the past 2 months) I've been dealing with a host of random health issues. Being in my mid-twenties and always having had an easy time with my health it was honestly super strange. I had the distinct thought, ""Damn, this is what 24 is like huh?"" 

The symptoms included diarrhea, difficulty breath, headaches, difficultly sleeping, difficulty thinking, and worst of all was an awful rash that started on every joint and would constantly be flaring up painfully everyday. I genuinely struggled with work in a way I hadn't in months, and these symptoms lasted 2 months.

The main symptom that really grabbed me was the rash, and as such I got first lotion on it since it sort of looked like dry skin. After 2 weeks of no progress, I moved on to an over the counter cream for anti-fungal and hydrocortisone. While the cortisone did help with the itch, it did nothing to stop the painful spread of the infection. After that I went to my pharmacist, and got some more creams that would help. They did not. 

It wasn't until another week after trying those creams (almost 2 months from onset of symptoms) that I figured out what was going on from the most unlikely place. 

I don't watch Dr. House, but occasionally on YouTube Shorts I will be recommended clips from the show. During the clip that engrossed me on the toilet, Dr. House was chastising another doctor for not realizing the difference between Brazil and Bolivia, and that their patient was suffering from Selenium Poisoning from Brazil Nuts. 

Turns out that the maximum amount of Selenium that an adult should take in before having signs of toxicity is only 400 micrograms a day. Each nut has roughly 100 micrograms of Selenium. I was eating 12 a day because I'd heard they were good for testosterone production, and the Trader Joe's bag I'd bought had a serving size of a quarter cup (which is over the healthy limit). 

Now a few days after of no longer putting nuts in my mouth, I feel loads better and most of my symptoms have largely disappeared. 

I'm honestly making this post to hopefully save others from the same mistake, and to bring attention to the issue. I have a hard time that Trader Joe's suppliers who grow these for a living don't know the present and real danger the food possesses if eaten more than 2-3 nuts a day. I tried to give them feedback on the product to help them improve, but they've ignore my request for a week now and I thought others should know. 

TL;DR: I got a huge host of medical issues randomly, and turns out it was because I was eating my ""healthy snacks"". Brazil nuts can quickly poison you if consumed more than a 1-3 nuts daily, and Trader Joe's recommends eating 30+ on their packaging. 

Edited to add: I had originally said 30 nuts is a quarter cup, but was only doing that based on some incorrect nutrition site. People pointed out the error in the comments and broke down the math. It's still unhealthy with the amount recommended in the serving size.

I’m Hypersexual, it’s a trauma response from past things yada yada you know the drill. But, with the hypersexuality, comes an intense masturbation addiction, I’m usually jerking off twice a day because of it.   
I started doing this, Rabbit hole by Deco\*27 was massively trending, like to the point I couldn’t go on social media without hearing it. Another issue I have is that, for whatever reason, there is always a song in my head.

,tifu,"This was preceded by a long line of various other fuckups. He (23M), I'll call him M, and I (28F), friends for four years, both have depression and social anxiety. The first fuckup was I developed a crush on him... after getting over a rebound crush on his best friend three months earlier which ended because *that* guy ostracized me from my friend group because his girlfriend hated me. I confessed to M five months ago. He didn't feel the same way. He said he didn't want to make things awkward and that we were still friends. He moved on from it. I still have feelings. For four months it wasn't an issue, we hung out like normal online and there was no awkwardness.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. M and I and two other married friends all went on a camping trip together. They have a one bedroom apartment and one vehicle, and we all mutually decided to make that work. This was my first time seeing M in person in three years. From the minute we picked him up at the airport, he made a concerted effort to not look me in the eye as much as he possibly could. Often when I spoke to him, he'd look over my head or to the side of me. I felt pretty insulted by it, but I said nothing. Other than that and not particularly wanting to be near me, he talked normally, except whenever we were alone together when it was dead silence. In two words, very awkward.

Apparently my second fuck up was my trying to sit next to him in the car for the drive to the state park, which I admit, yeah, a not insignificant part was me wanting to sit next to him. But also because a large part of it was because there were four of us trying to cram four people's and one small dog's worth of camping shit into a goddamn compact crossover with a trunk the size of a postage stamp. I'm a small person, and if you put me in the middle seat, there'd have been *sooo* much more space in the empty seat next to me for stuff, but M insisted I didn't need to. Instead I spent the four hour roundtrip squashed up against the car door, unable to move an inch, because his shit and other random shit was falling into me from the middle seat, in addition to various heavy articles sitting on top of my feet and cutting off their circulation.

Fast forward to when we're all back home. M doesn't talk to me for a week. He doesn't get on voice chat when I'm online in voice chat. I start panicking because anxiety and I'm terrified I offended him. I message him and ask him if I make him uncomfortable. No response for two days. I talk to my other friend (28M), I'll call him G, who went on the camping trip with us and asked him if he knew what I did to make M uncomfortable. I was already starting to spiral, and I forgot that G has a tendency to blab while also grossly exaggerating or twisting around things other people said/did. G told me M was annoyed with me constantly putting myself down and talking about sad/depressing things in my life during the whole trip.

I had no idea I was even doing it. I thought I was just being myself, and I thought everybody had a good time because everybody said afterward they had a good time, including M. I struggle with body-focused anxiety, body dysmorphia, and PTSD from being bullied/abused in school. Every day is a fight not to let the bad thoughts win. I'm trying my hardest. G also said I made M uncomfortable by trying to sit next to him in the car, that he took it as an advance toward him. I had no idea any of this was going on because M said nothing to me about it the whole trip.

Then the huge fuckup... I had a mental breakdown and went off on M. I sent him several angry messages asking why he didn't just tell me I made him uncomfortable, sarcastically apologizing for not handling my depression as well as he does, and accusing him of being a hypocrite for being annoyed by my depression, because he constantly, *constantly*, makes jokes about offing himself and I say nothing, even though it makes me and G's spouse very uncomfortable, because that's his ""coping mechanism"". Worst of all, I told M never to talk to me again and unfriended him on everything. I instantly regretted it next morning because M doesn't like confrontation and basically shuts off whenever there's conflict, so I knew he wouldn't even try to respond. I talked to G's spouse, and they were angry at G for sticking his nose into everyone's business and reminded me that G has problems with that and twisting information and that I need to have a conversation with M about it.

After spending the day alternately sobbing, panicking and hating myself, I messaged him apologizing for yelling at him and said I jumped to too many conclusions based on what G said. I was so sure that M would never talk to me, so I got all my (false?) information from G, when instead I should've just waited and talked to M. Or waited and did nothing instead of going ballistic. M hasn't been online at all in two days. I just hope he's okay.

,tifu,"To preface this, I'm currently living in the dorms at university, and I have a single.  Even though there's 5 people in the suite, there's only one bathroom with one toilet.  Often times, I can't hold it in, and there will be like a 30 minute wait because somehow my suitemates will always be in the bathroom when I have to use it.  I also sometimes don't feel like getting fully dressed just to go to the bathroom, especially at night.  Due to this, I sometimes pee in bottles and throw them away later.

I didn't think there'd be any problem; I simply planned to empty the cup in the toilet during the middle of the night; that was, until the fire alarm sounded.  I assumed it was a drill, so I quickly threw on some clothes, but then I remembered that during fire drills, you get in trouble if you're still in your dorm, which means they had to check, which in turn meant they would see the pee cup.  I panicked, and immediately came up with the only solution that I thought would be quick enough and discrete enough.  

I drank the pee cup.

While drinking, I gagged a litttle towards the end and a little ended up on my shirt.  I threw on a sweatshirt to hide the splatter before finally exiting my dorm and making my way outside the building.  

As it turned out, though, it wasn't a fire drill at all, but an actual triggering of the fire alarm due to an incident with a microwave.  That means they didn't check the dorms and wouldn't have seen the pee cup anyways. 

I chugged my own pee for no reason.

Three days ago I decided I was sick of my nose being so flaky and decided to take an eyebrow razor to it.

Wrong.

I recently moved into a new apartment and was having trouble with my washing machine so the maintenance man came over to take a look. I happened to have my work computer open and as he was leaving he saw I was working in an Adobe program; he asked what I do for a living and I told him I'm a graphic designer. 

He immediately got very excited and asked if I could hold on while he went to grab his phone. My first thought was that he was going to ask if I could make something for him, which is something I'm used to, but instead he comes back and starts explaining that his daughter is currently going to school for graphic design. I said that's awesome and he asked if I could do him a favor and wait a moment while he called her, I said yes. 

This is where things got messy. There was already a bit of a language barrier going on because he isn't fluent in English, so I wasn't really able to ask why he wanted to call her, but I assumed he was just oddly excited to tell her he had met another graphic designer. 

Not the case...what he actually wanted was for *me* to speak with her. 

Background info: I'm a recent college graduate myself and have only been in the field for a couple years. I'm also very socially awkward.

Her Father seemed to finally realize he had created a very uncomfortable situation, thanked me, and then left. I'm still cringing at how awkward I was.

,tifu,"I collect and wear pocket watches, i've worn lots but lately i've been wearing a 1914 Hamilton 992, a watch made for the railroads, it's long overdue a service so i decided to take it out of storage and give it a spin while trying to find someone who'll service it.

Because it's a railroad watch it has a safety dial (clearly marked hours and minutes) and watch dials back then were enamel, and this one was in good condition, i've also never managed to chip, scratch or crack one, both of those changed today.

You see, there's something else about this watch, concerning the case the movement is in, for those unfamilar with pocket watches, most have a back cover that hinges down or screws off just like any other watch.

Not this watch though, to probably make the time inspector happy and make sure none of that coal dust could get into the movement while stoking the boiler (or desert sand while driving the spikes i guess) it's in a swing out case.

To open a case like this, you first pull up the crown (which doesn't set this watch because railroads), unscrew the crystal (cover) off the front and pry up on a tab located at 6 o'clock, the whole movement will hinge up, kinda like one of those cars where the whole body has to come up to get to the engine.

There's a few cardinal rules about opening a case like this, never do it with the crown down, and never do it with either hand at six o'clock or you'll bend them if you slip.

Also do it with the right piece, a finger nail or a paper clip, never use something of a hard metal, i should imagine it was made to fit some american coin that i don't have.

This morning i was hinging it open to do a movement inspection, i like it to do it on my old watches from time to time to make sure there's no nasty surprises (i also picked it up last night and it made a funny feeling like a spring unwinding), parts hanging off or cracked jewels, i couldn't get a good grip on the tab though so i decided to use a random piece of metal i found on my desk.

I broke the main rule of mechanical sympathy, never force anything, and it was a hard metal, and it was too thick for the tab.

It slipped.

There is now the tiniest chip at 6 o'clock in the dial, a reminder to me that swing out cases suck and to get the watchmaker to replace it with a normal one with a screwback or something.

It's definitely a tiny triangle shaped chip though, i am so lucky it wasn't worse, no hands got bent, no cracks and it's so small it's in the bleed area of the dial so you can't see it with the crystal screwed on, there is a tiny line of paint missing from the number 6 but it was probably pre-existing.

Just worried that cracks could spread from it or something now.

,tifu,"Trigger Warning: Mention of suicide 

Throwaway for privacy reasons, although I guess everyone knows already anyway. Sorry for formatting, etc. I'm on mobile and upset. 


So I just got fired from my job (for no reason except that a colleague hates me and she's been here longer than me) in a foreign country I moved to for my bf. Meaning I don't really have much of a support system here and have to leave the country if I don't work. I immediately texted my bf about it but couldn't take any of his calls afterward because I still was required to end my shift. When I got home I pretty much immediately went to bed.

We don't live together but he has a key and came over later that evening. By the time he was here I was awake but felt empty and like nothing mattered anymore. I was completely paralyzed.

Now for some reason when he came in he didn't greet me or anything, just saw the lights were out and assumed I was sleeping I guess? And waited in another room. He came in every 10 Minutes or so to look after me but didn't say anything, so I also didn't say anything and I just felt ignored and became more irritated the longer he stayed without doing anything. 

At some point he realised I was awake and tried talking to me. I was still feeling many negative things, yet nothing at all and couldn't deal with anything anymore, so I shut everything down and just kept telling him that I've got nothing to say, nothing makes sense and he should leave, to the point I actually offered him money just to leave me alone. He finally concluded that I must be suicidal (he knows I used to be a while before we got together) and got scared I would do something horrible if I left (which admittedly I did and sometimes still do consider - but I'm a coward and would never actually act on it). There was a lot of back and forth that ended in me luring him out of my flat and stealing my keys back so he couldn't get back in. He obviously was very worried and I heard trough my window that he called friend before he went home. I fell asleep shortly after. 

It's now the evening of the next day and I still haven't taken any of his calls. I have also received several texts and calls from mutual friends and his mom. I can't pick up or answer, I'm not sure why, guess I'm still paralyzed and in denial, haven't been able to really process anything. And now a bunch of people now about something I haven't even fully realised myself and think I'm dead or something. Also I'm incredibly confused that my bf is so worried that he tells everyone about it, except actual authorities who could do something about someone actually being suicidal??? Like if he thinks I'm dead why doesn't he call an ambulance/police or something? Not that any of this is his fault, he's a wonderful person and  must be devestated, but getting mad about weird details takes my mind off other things. 

I know what I did/I'm doing is terrible and I don't know what to do. I'm sure if he had just hugged me, I would've snapped out of it and none of this would've happened. But it's not his job to fix me and read my mind. I think there is no coming back and I ruined our relationship forever. There's no way he could or should trust me again after this. Also everyone he knows now knows about my problems and thinks I'm crazy and/or dead. I'm thinking of just burning all bridges, move to my home country and start over. He doesn't deserve this.

,tifu,"I (27NB) took today off work to drive my partner (32NB) to an appointment. My partner had an appointment at 10am for an EEG at a hospital roughly 40 minutes from where my partner and I live.
For the EEG, my partner needs to have extremely clean hair. This is because the test uses electrodes on the scalp to measure brain activity. The only way to achieve this is for my partner to shower right before we leave for the appointment.

My partner is a nocturnal individual and usually sleeps from 7am to between 1pm and 3pm, so I was expected to wake them up early enough to get ready and drive them to the appointment. Normally I wake up at 6am for work, so this should not have been a problem.
I have been consistently required to work on job sites downtown starting between 7:30am and 8am nearly every workday for several weeks. Sleeping in has not been an option, at all.

Recently, due to my severe asthma and possible sleep apnea (unverified), I have been struggling with sleeping through the night. I have been tired constantly and often sleep through a large part of the weekend. Seasonal issues are not fun. It gets to my partner too, as they have very bad hay fever, in addition to mild asthma.

Today, I overslept and didn't wake up until after 9am. I suspect that my half asleep self thought my 8am alarm was my 6am alarm and dismissed it. Because I overslept, I didn't wake my partner up on time and they had to call the hospital to reschedule the test.

Now, whatever is wrong with their brain is going to take an extra few weeks to be diagnosed. They've been struggling and their neurologist is concerned. It's going to take longer to get the help they need because I overslept. 
I stayed in bed more than 3 hours late and delayed my partner's access to treatment for potentially life threatening neurological issues. They needed me and I was asleep. 

If whatever is wrong in their brain gets worse, or even becomes fatal because of the delay, it will be my fault. My fault; their quality of life DEGRADED BECAUSE OF ME. I made life worse for the person I love most. I have failed as a partner and I'll never be able to make up for it! Never! 
I fucked up when they needed me the most. I don't know if my partner will ever forgive me, which they probably shouldn't, but I don't think it will ever be possible to forgive myself.

,tifu,"So, I (22M) matched with this beautiful girl (22F) on Hinge last week. She was the one who commented on my profile first, and I matched with her back because she’s gorgeous. For context, we’re both in Southern California. She’s currently pursuing her master’s degree, while I’ve recently graduated with my bachelor’s and now have a full-time job.

Here’s how everything played out. We met in person for the first time during a weeknight at an outdoor mall restaurant. We hugged when we saw each other, had a good meal, and got to know each other a bit. Afterward, we saw Smile 2, a horror movie, and ended up cuddling in the theater. The first date went really well—we broke the touch barrier, and she seemed to enjoy my company, laughing at my jokes and staying close to me.

Our second date was two days later, on Friday night, and it was even better. I won’t go into too much detail, but we ate out, went to the beach, and spent the whole evening together. By this point, we were really comfortable with each other, and I could tell she was attracted to me. After dinner, we got some food to-go near her place (I was the one driving since she lives with a roommate, and I live with my parents). She suggested eating at her apartment, and I agreed.

At her place, we ate, made out, cuddled, and then she fell asleep in my arms—her head resting on my chest and her leg draped over me. It felt amazing. I ended up spending the entire weekend with her.

Saturday and Sexual Anxiety
On Saturday, we had an incredible time. We took pictures, went to a pumpkin patch, visited the zoo, ate good food, and caught another movie. At this point, we’d spent almost every waking moment together. I also slept over at her apartment again, but there was still no sex. I have to admit, I’ve only had sex once before, and I get anxious when it comes to initiating. She seemed to really want it, but I kept holding back, partly because of my lack of experience and partly due to sexual anxiety.

I think what makes things more complicated is that I’m into some kinky stuff—CBT, facesitting, feet, domination—and I wasn’t sure how to bring that up. She strikes me as more submissive and gentle, and I didn’t know if she’d be open to it. I kept stalling, telling myself I’d make a move eventually. But when she kissed me the next morning and teased, “I’ll take all my clothes off right now, what do you wanna do?” I still couldn’t do it. I told her, “Let’s eat first and go out—we’ll do it tonight.” She seemed a little disappointed but didn’t push me.

We spent the day at the Pike Outlets in Long Beach, enjoying ourselves again, but I knew I was running out of excuses.

The Night It Fell Apart
That night, we went back to her apartment. Things escalated—we kissed, made out, and started taking each other’s clothes off. We were in her room, the lights dimmed, and the moment felt right. But when it came time for things to get physical, I couldn’t stay hard. She tried giving me a handjob, but it didn’t help. I suggested she sit on my lap to get things going—sometimes that works for me—but even then, I kept losing my erection.

At this point, I felt humiliated. I hated myself. I was trying so hard to make it work, suggesting different positions, but they were all pretty vanilla since I didn’t know how to introduce the kinks I’m into. Normal sex doesn’t turn me on the same way kink does, and I felt trapped. I wanted to ask her to be more dominant or to grab me in a certain way, but I was too scared to bring it up.

After an hour of trying, I asked her to grab my balls while she gave me a handjob—it’s something that worked with an ex who was also into kink. But this time, it didn’t have the same effect. Eventually, she just collapsed face-down on the bed in silence. I felt awful.

Then, out of nowhere, she started crying.

The Aftermath
At first, I thought she was crying because I was terrible in bed. But she told me that wasn’t it—she thought I wasn’t attracted to her. She kept saying she felt ugly, and it broke my heart. I tried to comfort her, telling her she was beautiful and that I was absolutely attracted to her. She really is stunning—she’s a dancer with an amazing body and the sweetest personality—but I didn’t know how to explain that my struggles were more about me and my sexual preferences.

I spent the next hour holding her, reassuring her, and telling her how gorgeous she is. But she kept crying, convinced that she wasn’t enough for me. It was devastating. Honestly, I would have preferred if she had been angry at me—it felt so much worse knowing she thought she wasn’t attractive.

Eventually, I left that night. I told her I had to go home for work, but she was worried I’d ghost her. I reassured her that wasn’t the case, but I felt like I’d already hurt her deeply.

Where We Are Now
She’s still texting me and even calling me “babe”—it’s like she really wants me in her life. She told me I’m the best guy she’s ever been with (though obviously not sexually), and I feel the same way about her. I really care about her, and we have an amazing bond. But I’m still terrified about the sexual side of things.

I want her to know what I’m into, but I’m scared she won’t understand or that it’ll push her away. She seems more submissive, and I don’t know if she’d be comfortable taking on a more dominant role. I think she’d be willing to try for me, but I don’t want to overwhelm her or make her uncomfortable.

TL;DR:
I couldn’t get it up for my girlfriend because I’m into kink, and she seems more vanilla. She ended up thinking I wasn’t attracted to her and cried, even though I am attracted to her. She still wants to be with me, and we have a really close bond, but I’m scared to tell her about my kinks and not sure how to move forward.

,tifu,"I don't have a good story, but I think its worthy of the Fucked Up seal-of-approval. My first expensive purchase gone wrong.  
Two days ago, I decided to buy something. A new gaming headset to maybe replace my current ones. My current ones are mostly fine, mostly a bit of earmuff wear and plastic creaking, just a little worried about something breaking.

After looking through options, I decided on some tempting ones that functioned about the same. (they were actually worse upon trying them today). They were on Best Buy for a pretty okay discount, though still quite expensive...I checked out as guest because I didn't want to sign up for a site I'd probably use one or twice, thought it wasn't worth it.  

I was wrong to not use an account.

I went through the motions of the name, location, payment, yada yada yada. Until I went through and I got to the order confirmation page.

Gnail.com. G NAIL. I didn't even notice even after I looked over everything in the checkout.

So now I didn't get updates in my gmail on where it was, or to see the order.  
Worse, the order number page just upped and refreshed for no reason on the website, so now I couldn't see it again because I'm a guest with no purchase history.  
Even worse, I want to return the headset because it's a bit complicated and sounds inferior. I still have the cardboard box with whatever information that has stickered on, and the purchase proof in my bank, but I think I'm SOL because of no order number. And Best Buy support kinda sucks

,tifu,"It all started Sunday and deep down I knew I was making a mistake. It began with a cheddar cheese omelet in the morning, followed by a cheese burger with provolone for lunch, and 2 cheese quesadillas for dinner. I actually paused in the afternoon when I pulled out the 3 pepper Colby jack for a snack, knowing what I was going to have for dinner, but that sweet cheese was calling my name. I didn't pay the price until Tuesday morning. 

I'm extremely regular, so it was a problem when I spent 15 minutes trying to pass the results of my Sunday. I don't know why the body will create a mass bigger than your sphincter, but there I was. Having to move on with my day, I stood up and felt the mass retreat into my body. 

I knew I needed help, so I bought some fiber capsules before work. The recommended dose is 4-5 capsules, 4 times a day. I popped 5 immediately, 5 more before lunch, and 5 more a couple of hours later. By 4 my guts were starting to rumble. 

I managed to keep it contained until I got home and ran to the bathroom to pass this unholy log. Another 15 minute battle commenced where I strained so hard that I had to pray I wouldn't pass away on the toilet like the king. (RIP Elvis.)

I finally managed to get it out of me. Noting that a poop knife would have been appropriate,  I was lucky that it flushed without any further issues. 

It took me another 5 minutes to get cleaned up when my wife had the audacity to ask (clearly knowing my schedule and that the afternoon wasn't normal) me if I was ""alright."" 

The worst part is that I know the excess fiber capsules are still doing their thing, while I feel like I just pulled an all nighter as the damn bottom at a Diddy party. 

TL;DR: Ate too much cheese. Compensated with fiber capsules. The fight still isn't over.

,tifu,"About three or four months ago, I did something truly terrible that changed how I see myself. It’s one of those moments that will stick with me forever—kind of funny and yet profoundly embarrassing.

So, there I was at a family party, which was a big deal because my family is enormous. I’m talking about all my dad’s sisters, their kids, and everyone was having a blast. The venue had a pool divided into sections for kids and adults, and things were going great until a weird incident changed everything.

I was in a room with some cousins. We were singing, dancing, and just being silly, with music blasting. Then, as it often does at parties, there was that awkward silence between songs. Suddenly, we heard someone banging on the door. It was one of the adults, and she yelled, “Who can swim? Your brother is drowning!”

Everyone in the room sprang into action, rushing out to help. But for some reason, I stayed behind, calmly talking to the woman and asking what was going on. She looked at me in disbelief, insisting I should help my brother. I kept insisting he was fine, just splashing around in the pool. Meanwhile, my mind was completely frozen.

Finally, I decided to join everyone outside, only to find that my brother had been wearing a floating device that helped him swim, and he was heading toward the adult section where he really shouldn’t have been. He was the only one swimming there when suddenly, the floating device popped, and all the air inside it went out. My mom jumped in to help him, and she was grabbing onto the edge of the pool, then she walked toward my brother. When she realized that she couldn’t reach him because she was small and the pool was too deep, she went back to the edge of the pool and kept trying to get to him multiple times, despite how difficult it was. She later told my dad that in those moments, she felt like she wanted to die(That’s why she kept trying to save my brother, knowing that she couldn’t. She’d rather die trying to help her son than watch him drown in front of her). My grandma jumped in too, but when she noticed she couldn’t reach the bottom, she stopped. By the time I came back, everything was already happening. They were trying to get my brother out of the pool, and I felt so late to the whole situation

As I watched my family struggle, my thoughts turned dark and selfish. All I could think was how this would ruin the party. I remember thinking, “Great, we’ll leave early now. My mom’s going to hate pools.” I felt like a terrible person, especially knowing that my younger sister were being more helpful than I was.

Eventually, my brother was rescued by someone who actually knew how to swim. I stood awkwardly smiling while everyone else rushed to help. When it was over, I was left feeling ashamed. I had brought towels and napkins, but in my mind, I was still processing the absurdity of the situation.

Later that day, we wrapped up the night with my brother going back to swim, and I joined him too. But it didn’t stop there. When everything happened, I went back to my cousins,—the ones I was dancing with—who were all yelling at me, cussing me out. “What the heck were you doing? Why were you so silent?” they asked. I tried to lighten the mood by saying, “Oh my God, let me tell you what was going through my mind!” But they were so judgmental about what I did. I felt awful, but I just kept joking around to cope.

At one point, they yelled at me to bring water, so I did. But as I was going to get it, I couldn’t help but think, “Why would I bring water if my grandma or my mom was, like, drowning with water?” I was trying to make light of the situation, but deep down, I felt like the worst person ever.

That car ride home was silent, filled with my thoughts about the whole ordeal. I couldn’t shake the embarrassment and regret. That moment haunts me, reminding me of how unprepared I was when my family needed me the most.

When I was in 6th grade, my school had this thing called a Starlab. It was basically an inflatable mini planetarium. A whole class could fit inside and watch the outer space projections on the ceiling. Cool, right?

Except it was very dark, you had to crawl through a tunnel to get in and out, and I suddenly felt super claustrophobic.

I tried to sneak out a nervous fart, but I ripped ass instead. It echoed. And it stank. Kids yelled, gagged, and fell over each other trying to get out of the Starlab. I had just turned it into a real gas giant.

In a likely violation of the Geneva Convention, the teacher ordered everyone to sit down and remain in my fart bubble until the space presentation was over. This teacher was retired military, and thus completely unfazed by my weapon of ass destruction.

It was dark enough in the Starlab that no one could confirm that I was the source. That was the only saving grace.

I’m not sure how much anyone learned about space that day. The take-home was, “The Starlab smelled like Uranus.”

&lt;p&gt;Except it was very dark, you had to crawl through a tunnel to get in and out, and I suddenly felt super claustrophobic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to sneak out a nervous fart, but I ripped ass instead. It echoed. And it stank. Kids yelled, gagged, and fell over each other trying to get out of the Starlab. I had just turned it into a real gas giant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a likely violation of the Geneva Convention, the teacher ordered everyone to sit down and remain in my fart bubble until the space presentation was over. This teacher was retired military, and thus completely unfazed by my weapon of ass destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was dark enough in the Starlab that no one could confirm that I was the source. That was the only saving grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how much anyone learned about space that day. The take-home was, “The Starlab smelled like Uranus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL:DR I farted in the Starlab and dutch-ovened my 6th grade class.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"Last weekend my GF (32F) and I (32M) went to a friend’s wedding. We're not a ""drinking couple”. So far in our relationship I had never seen her drunk until last week. Only slightly tipsy after a few occasional champagne glasses. I myself don't drink at all, but I'm ok with her having a drink here and there (we have openly talked about this).

At the wedding, on the way to the party, she said to me ""Hey! I feel like getting drunk tonight. I haven't done it in a long time. Is that ok with you?"". I thought ""What the hell, if she wants it this one time... why not let her?"". 

Fast forward to 2AM and my GF is plastered, stumbling and slurring her words. When I saw her falling asleep in her chair and almost slipping to the floor, I decided it was time to put her in bed. 

I took her back to our hotel room, undressed her, and laid her in bed; then, she said she was going to be sick. So I got her up again, walked her to the toilet, and fulfilled my gentleman’s duty holding her hair while she threw up.

And that's when the weird boner happened: I got rock-hard down there and kind of aroused while she gagged and spewed wedding cake. After she was done vomiting (it took her a while), I took her back to bed and I masturbated to get rid of my hard-on. 

I have a strong stomach. Seeing someone vomit doesn’t make me feel squeamish. That said, I also don't have an inclination for that kind of stuff. I’d say I’m pretty neutral to bodily functions - we are humans, those things happen. I know there is fetish porn about vomiting, but that's never been my cup of tea.

This is the first time I’ve seen her be sick. Overall, I had a pretty fun time seeing her get drunk and taking care of her, and she was naked while vomiting, if those are things that can explain what happened... Not going to say I'm traumatised by this. I just feel a bit awkward.

,tifu,"This post is intended to accompany my other post, as a potential explanation.

A bit of backstory, my family has been neighbours with another family since I was 4. Let’s call them the Smith family. The Smiths have 2 kids, Michael (26m) and Nicky (21m). Nicky is a year older than me and hung out with my younger brother (16m) and me (20m) during our childhood.

Growing up, Nicky was always stronger than us. He probably wasn’t as bad as others, but he would often resort to violence whenever we didn’t please him. One memory I have was during a sleepover, where my allergies caused me to make sounds. He would get up, come to me, and punch me several times. It was done repeatedly for each noise I made, getting harder each time. 

Michael was kinder to us, never assaulting us. The issue was…Michael would be violent towards Nicky instead. One memory I have is Michael kicking Nicky’s back. I recall seeing Nicky cry from the bullying. Another more important memory, is a time where the Smith brothers and I were Kayaking. Michael tossed Nicky into the water, told him there were rocks, and kayaked away with me in it. He called Nicky a pussy, and said even I was braver than him. There might’ve been a chain of violence. I’m not innocent in terms of violence either. I made my younger brother cry and also got into a lot of fights at school, probably the most out of the 4 of us. Maybe it’s just boys being boys.

This summer, I flew back home from college. Nicky was still abroad but Michael was home. In August, I went to visit him, he currently has his own place. We sat down and caught up with life.

I decided to tell him about the [house fire](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nijmegen/comments/18uu2z1/i_feel_so_lost_update_to_the_electrician_scammer/) I had back in December. How unfairly I felt like I was treated, being blamed by my landlord for the fire just because of how it [looked](https://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/191rakq/can_a_kitchen_hood_catch_on_fire_on_its_own/), yet he isn't a professional and didn't request an investigation during the night of the incident, when the firefighters were there. After hearing the story, he said something along the lines of “The landlord could’ve charged you more, so just be glad"". By now, I am 95% sure I didn’t cause the fire, and I told Michael that. I also told him how frustrated I was that my parents paid the landlord 400 euros, to show that it was in the past. In the same conversation, I asked Michael if he got into fights at school. He said he didn’t, because he “doesn’t like causing trouble”.

After leaving the house, I kept thinking of the conversation we just had. The same person who abused his brother growing up, yet never fought anyone his own size, is telling me to let things go, to take the easy route, the pussy route. I often threw myself at bigger kids at school and even punched Nicky back a few times, so while I caused more trouble for my parents, I felt that I was more honourable.

Fast forward a few days, we were having a celebration for my younger brother’s birthday. It wasn’t his actual birthday, but we had an early celebration as his birthday fell on a school day (my university and my brother’s high school have different academic calendars, being in different countries and all). My brother was going to have another, bigger celebration after I left. Little bro was hanging out with his friends in a different room, while I was sitting at a table with my dad and Michael. Michael asked what I’d been up to. 

Me: Oh, I’ve been rehearsing

Michael: Oh, for what?

Me: Well, you see

I brought up my observations about his behaviour growing up.

Suddenly, my brother and his friends entered the room to ask my dad for something. I tried to quickly tell them to leave the room, looking back I could’ve simply waited, but I panicked and just continued.

Me: You’re a pussy Michael.

I don’t quite remember the rest of the conversation, everyone was shocked. My mom entered the room, hearing the commotion. My dad recommends I leave to buy more pizzas with my mom, to which I comply, though not without saying “Go fuck yourself” while leaving the room, much to my dad’s annoyance.

On the way to the store, I explained what happened to Mom. My mom says that it’s just Michael’s opinion. I told her how I felt like I was being victim-blamed, and combined with the bullying growing up, made things really frustrating. I also described my theory of the violent chain, how Michael hitting Nicky caused Nicky to take the anger out on us, making Michael potentially guilty of my childhood bullying.

Nonetheless, I understood that it was all in the past and that my behaviour was irrational. Once we got home, I went to apologize to Michael and explained why I was mad. He accepted my apology. He then explained that he wasn't blaming me or telling me to be grateful, more of looking at the positives, how my landlord could've made things more complicated by charging me the full amount, potentially leading to a lawsuit and hours of investigation. Later on, after leaving the country, I texted him, telling him that I was also a coward, making no effort to stand up to the [electrician ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nijmegen/comments/18a5525/was_i_scammed_am_i_entitled_to_a_refund/)because they might have social power over me.

In the end, I got mad at the wrong people, and let the incident cause me further trouble over 8 months later.

,tifu,"I am a freshman in college and I partook in the smoking of ganja in highschool. My friends and I were dumb, so we took pictures of ourselves smoking in ridiculous outfits and the like, and I never thought about the photos since I took them.

For context I take a freshman course that requires we do ""photo assignments"" where we send pictures of ourselves out and about, interacting with the world. This week I was lazy and only got 3 of the four photos, so I picked a random one from my past that looked similar enough to me now. Unfortunately the bl-unt I was holding blended in with my shirt and I sent it in without a second thought.

,tifu,"So basically I am 20 and female green eyes black hair very short, I actually had just turned 20 less than a month ago. I am in nursing school which I graduate next year. When I joined college i had a boyfriend however we broke up because he sucked. In my new class (we are all stuck together for 2 years) I notice the most attractive man ever. I like older men usually like 25-26 the issues are so real. However this has been normal to me as my mom and step dad are 15 years apart. I meet this man let’s call him James. James is 6’6 has 3 kids and is 40. I became extremely close with james, helping eachother with homework and just being best friends as we are stuck together 5 sometimes 6 days a week for 12+ hours per day. James has always looked out for me and everyone in class calls him the dad. Well fast forward half way through the program i started really thinking james is super hot and funny. So we start playful flirting etc … LAST WEEK i send him a nude during class or 2 and then he asks to get some drinks after class and just chat etc.. So we did and then it just got real talking abt deep stuff and sexual stuff. I had to go to work so I let him know i’ll see him soon. I texted him saying i wanted to play in reference to sex and he said when he is off work to come over. Of course I do of course im nervous and of course i end up getting drunk bc i was nervous as did he. It was fire. I spent the night woke up and did it again then left and went to work. We text every day throughout the day. He has kids i am 20 what do i do if i think i have feelings for james? is this something i need to let go of or do i see it through? He is super busy a lot of the time but we got dinner yesterday with classmates and idk it just feels right but i am aware it might not be.

,tifu,"Growing up as a guy only around women I picked up small things but nothing major. The issues is when I would talk to a girl and tell my mom about it, i would get the classic “Is she your girlfriend?” No matter the context so i would normally just say my friend or a classmate but in the same breath mentioned guys. It’s a vague memory but my family tried to gay test me as a kid. The asked me if I had to check my nails how would I check it, my dumbass used to put my hand of a flat surface to see all hands at once because I peeled my nails a lot, The results became inconclusive. I act more “feminine” and watching “girly” shows like miraculous or Steven universe and my mom saw that. A few years of this down the road my mom starts acting weird around me, during this time my mom was mad at my sister for dating but never inviting anybody over, the issue was her not knowing who my sister was dating. 

Just to avoid future issues so I don’t have to sneak around I ask my mom if I can start trying to date women, the second the word women left my mouth my mom looked like she seen a ghost. Then she started laughing at me. She told me how she assumed I was gay and how from her perspective I 1.randomly stopped talking about women, 2. Act feminine because I don’t know what is considered straight or gay actions because I only grew up around women, 3. I talk way more about my guy friends. The thing is she say my search history before I knew what incognito was, TWICE! So I don’t know how she didn’t know I was 100% straight. We shared a laugh but she told me how she would support me however i turned out. To this day she still slightly suspects me.

Smaller examples my mom used  

Wearing towels up to my nipples

Crossing my legs when I sit

Watched My little pony for a year because I’ll want any show with a good opening theme beck then. Im not a Brony 

Preferred my stuffed animals over action figures because I liked how soft they were

Played with my hair, my hair grows fast thanks to my genetics.

Only liking soft things which was later found to my related to sensory issues I had 

Listening more to girly songs

Every time me getting a girlfriend was brought up I said “I didn’t want a girlfriend” without clarifying i didnt want a boyfriend no excuse for that one, just didn’t want a relationship at the time

Using slang like “period 💅 “ for a while because my mom/sister said it a lot

Being obsessed with Kirby and animal crossing 

Minor stuff but that’s what let to her conclusion but I see where she’s coming from

I kind of felt hurt in a way. I don&amp;#39;t know why. So I said something like &amp;quot;Whoa you text differently their.&amp;quot; I was met with a response of just &amp;quot;Yea that just happens when I&amp;#39;m around my friends&amp;quot;. I was like damn. Im not a friend? I then said something about being jealous of those people then. I was then sent a sticker and we sent stickers till She stopped. So yea I&amp;#39;m kind of fucked man. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. Anyone have any advice on what I should do? (Sorry if this was really bad its my first time posting here)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I got a crush on my online friend. They are great. I was sent a screenshot of them talking to their other friends. I made a comment about how she seemed different and that I was a little jealous. Conversation then ended. I&amp;#39;m scared and don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"TIFU: Didn't realize how sick my parents dog really was

Trigger warning: the dog dies

So, this happened last weekend. My parents always have me take care of their 2 horses and 2 dogs when they go on vacation or do a long day trips. I live ~17 minute car ride away (US). It is a burden, but they give me free childcare 3 days a week, so I just accept I'm their go to for all tasks. 

A bit of background, my mom was a vet tech before I was born (~34 years ago). We were always raised that pets are family and they deserve the best. This is something I adhere to today as well. My mom doesn't ask my older brother to do help because he follows his wife (no vet/vaccines, no check ups, no spay/neuter). 

My parents brought their dogs to my house Saturday night since they were leaving Sunday morning. I have their 2 dogs (Old= old dog, 15ish + Young= younger dog, 4ish). My two don't really factor into this story. So, Old needs a lot of extra help, she lost a leg to bone cancer last year, she is deaf, needs help going up and down stairs. Young is healthy and has fun playing with my 2 ragamuffin pups.

Sunday morning is normal. All 4 dogs eat/play. Sunday afternoon around 2 pm, Young starts acting off. She seems stiff, is off-standish, not with the other dogs. Around 4pm, I start to get concerned and offer Young a dog treat. She doesn't eat it. I call my parents while they are driving to their cabin to tell them she's acting off and describe her symptoms. 

My mom and I agree she has probably eaten one of my 3 year olds toys. I don't know which one. My mom said she's bad about that, I have no idea which toy she could've eaten, but I go about monitoring. 

She gets more off-standish, but is still mobile, drinking water, and pees/poops outside. I continue to update my mom.

Now, this is when it all goes to hell. My younger brother is special needs and is scared to stay the night alone. So I'm at my home with my son and 4 dogs. My husband goes to my parents house to look after my brother and take care of the horses (my brother doesn't want to stay at our house). 

I put my 3 year old down around 9pm, Young follows me into his room, so she was mobile at 9pm. Young and I hang on the couch until I'm ready for bed around 10:15pm. Young can no longer stand without assistance. 

I call my husband and tell him to get home asap. I call my mom and tell her Young is not doing well. She is understandably upset. I am doing online check in at Emergency vet clinic (closest one is 23 min away) while my husband is coming home to stay with toddler. 

My mom is convinced Young ate a toddler toy  This is incredibly likely. But I always put up toys because one of my dogs will destroy toddler toys too. So it is standard protocol to put away toddler toys every evening and before we leave the house. My mom thinks it happened Saturday night because Young shouldn't have reached that point so quickly.

Before my husband gets here, Young throws up, starts choking. 

I'm on speaker with my parents. I'm following their instructions, doing chest compressions, rescue breaths, checking her mouth. She stopped breathing twice. I was able to get her breathing again once. 

Shitty story summed up, Young didn't make it. Lots of tears. My parents leave the cabin immediately to come back. I wrap up Young in a towel and blanket and placed her on the guest bed. 

It's been a bit over a week now. My mom 100% blames me. She is still giving us childcare for now, but isn't acknowledging me. We used to be so close. I don't know what to do. I can't fix this. In hindsight, I obviously would've taken her to the vet sooner. I figured I'd just take her to the vet first thing Monday morning if she was still off.

Young had cancer previously. My grandfather is terrible for dropping his heart/BP pills. I know it was likely me, but maybe it wasn't. Regardless, the dog died on my watch.

I don't know how to open this conversation or how to apologize. I'm just stuck in this crappy loop where I made a poor decision to save a few bucks to avoid the emergency vet. 

I'm so frustrated. I moved to this stupid city to be closer to my parents for childcare. I hate the house and town. But it is too expensive to move and now if my parents decide to cut me off because I didn't take their dog to the vet sooner, I don't know how to afford childcare. And I am so screwed.

TL;DR: My parents dog was acting sick (likely ate a toddler toy and was impacted) and died. Now my mom hates me.

,tifu,"My wife and I have been happily married for just over a year, but we’ve been together for more than 10. Today, though, was strange.

She quit her teaching job at the end of the school year and found a new job that started in October. So, we decided to use the gap to fix up the house we bought last year: Painting, improving electrics, redecorating, that kind of stuff. I even took time off so we could work on it together. We made good progress but didn’t finish everything.

Now, with her new job, she’s working long hours and is exhausted, so finishing up on painting the last bits hasn’t happened even though I asked her if we could finish it many times. Tools and paint clutter the house.

Today, I finally got fed up with tripping over all the painting gear. I knew she prefers us painting together, but I wanted it done, and wanted to surprise her with the finished task. I set everything up carefully and painted the wall and the wooden rim. It looked good, no mess. I was proud of myself. But then my wife came home…

She saw the painting tape, looked at the wall, and became furious. She barely spoke to me, even though I made dinner. Finally, after asking repeatedly, she said, “It’s no use; you’ll just do it again anyway.” She criticized everything: I should have told her beforehand (it’s not like I do much without her knowing), used different paint, noticed a tiny paint drop.

Then we went to her parents’ anniversary. She didn’t wear her wedding ring (she never takes it off), barely spoke to me on the way, ignored me there, and was all smiles with everyone else. We walked home in silence, and she went to bed without saying goodnight.

So now I’m sitting here, wondering what on earth I missed and if my marriage is over.

Now why flip a coin if you're not going to follow the result? Well that's the beginning of the fuckup. I ignored the coin flip, got prepared, inserted a silicon plug and by the time I was good to go, the spouse was starting to stir. Oh well, right?

Except, after I'd done some posterior housekeeping I flushed the toilet and then dropped the plug in. Would it flush down? No. Could I plunge it back? No. I had first plugged myself and then done a second, better plugging on the toilet.

So not only was my alone time fun time thwarted, I also had to call a the plumber then take that nice young plumber into my confidence about why he was there. A nice, expensive plugged toilet, sigh.

,tifu,"******This is my first post, so I apologize for the formatting. I have redone it and split it into paragraphs. I hope this helps.


So this actually happened in May. I had recently left a long term relationship and decided it was time to get back out there. I (31F) downloaded Hinge and matched with a guy (33M) that was very good looking and we hit it off. After a few weeks, I agreed to go on a date with him. We agreed to meet up for a casual coffee date and a walk in the park. 
So it is time for the date and I show up on time but he is 15 minutes late, I let it go. Of course it’s awkward meeting someone and I had been out of the game for seven years so I wasn’t really sure what I was expecting. 

Anyways, he gets out of the car, comes up to me and opens his arm for a hug, and I reciprocate. He then immediately goes in for a kiss with an EXCESSIVE amount of tongue. It caught me off guard, but he was really good looking so I let it go. I figured I was just lame and this is what the cool kids do these days. 🤷🏽‍♀️ 
So, we get inside this little mom and Pop shop, place our order and it is time to pay, but he just walks away with the drinks. I said out loud “I guess I will pay for them”, he responded with “oh if you don’t mind”. I would like to note, I have absolutely no problem paying it just again threw me off because it was never discussed just assumed. Again,I let it go. 

We sit down and start having pretty decent conversation, but he is making very intense eye contact and making audible grunts, which made me a little uncomfortable but not enough to throw any major flags. 

So it is wrapping up and it is time to go to the park. Like a dumbass, I agree to get into the car with a stranger an allow him to drive us there instead of following behind. So we are driving along and he is going the wrong direction to the park. I asked where we were going and he tells me he wanted to take me a mountain lookout. But the specific location he mentioned is known as a place nothing good happens. I veto that. He then tells me he wants me to meet his mother. I say no to that as well. This man pulls up to his mom’s house. I told him in not comfortable with this. He tries to reassure me by mentioning that it’s really his house, his mom just lives with him. 🙄 

At this point, the red flags finally start to make an appearance. I told him that we had agreed to a walk in the park. He reluctantly agreed and headed to the park. He was also swerving all over the road andI swear he fell asleep at least once if not twice. I wanted to just dip out, but I didn’t have my car so I had to ride it out. I convinced him to let me swing by to get my car so it wouldn’t be a hassle later. I should have bailed right then. But nooooo, me being a dumbass, I still follow him to the park. 

So we start walking and this man pulls his shirt off and leaves it off for the remainder of the date. Keep in mind, it’s a public park with a bunch of kids and old people. He wants us to sit on a bench to talk. We sit down. 
Y’all, this man starts to pray, LOUD af. 
About how grateful he was that I was put into his life and how much he LOVES me and he is in love with me and that I’m his girlfriend. People are walking past us just making eye contact with me as I mouth the words, “I’m so sorry”. It was so awkward. 

I should probably mention this guy is like 6’4” at like 250+lbs. very athletic obviously works out. big enough that I knew I couldn’t take him if I ran. At this point, I was just trying to hurry it along so I could go home. 

We start walking again and he tries to lead me to the edges of the park. The crowd is no longer granny’s and little kids. I’m stepping over needles and around homeless people. There are a bunch of abandoned buildings nearby. He said, “I’ve never been in these buildings at night, wanna check em out with me?” I said,  “NO, I think my mom is calling I need to go home. Thankfully he didn’t push it too far. 
So he walks me back to my car and as I try to slide in, as I’m swinging my feet under the dash he grabs my left foot (wearing flip flops) and proceeds to put his MOUTH on my toes. 
Yall, the gasp I gasped! 
He notices, let’s go and says, “hang on”. He is parallel parked in front of me so I can’t just leave. He digs in his truck for a while and comes back with a jacket. He throws it through my driver window all the way to the back of my SUV. Looks me dead in the eyes, serious af, and says, “just so you know, I’m very possessive of my belongings, and you are not girlfriend now”. I just looked back and said ok cool. I took tf off. I looked like Lightning McQueen pulling out. 

Something didn’t feel right, so I pull over a few blocks over and grab the jacket. I look in the pocket and there is an Apple Air Tag inside. I threw it in the dumpster at in the parking lot and took the longest way home I could. 

Dates over, I’m alive! I call my bff and tell her wtf just happened. She was like, “BITCH, did you forget how to google”. I get home, put my FBI cap on and start looking. Tell me why THREE mugshots pop up, drugs, assault, and domestic violence. I also find him in one of those, “are we dating the same guy” groups. Yall, his exwife and other past partners had all the receipts. This man is crazy af. He is also in school to be an anesthesiologist! The last person I would want around while I’m unconscious! 

I forgot to mention the funniest part! While we headed to the park he pulls out a gift card for Bonefish Grill and says, “there’s a little over $14 left, do you want to go share an appetizer?” 😂😂😂

TL;DR I went on a date with a psychopath that tried to take me to a secluded mountain top, an abandoned building, and to meet his mom (that he lives with) on a FIRST DATE!

I (31F) downloaded Hinge and matched with a guy (33M) that was very good looking and we hit it off. After a few weeks, I agreed to go on a date with him. We agreed to meet up for a casual coffee date and a walk in the park. 
So it is time for the date and I show up on time but he is 15 minutes late, I let it go. Of course it’s awkward meeting someone and I had been out of the game for seven years so I wasn’t really sure what I was expecting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, he gets out of the car, comes up to me and opens his arm for a hug, and I reciprocate. He then immediately goes in for a kiss with an EXCESSIVE amount of tongue. It caught me off guard, but he was really good looking so I let it go. I figured I was just lame and this is what the cool kids do these days. 🤷🏽‍♀️ 
So, we get inside this little mom and Pop shop, place our order and it is time to pay, but he just walks away with the drinks. I said out loud “I guess I will pay for them”, he responded with “oh if you don’t mind”. I would like to note, I have absolutely no problem paying it just again threw me off because it was never discussed just assumed. Again,I let it go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sit down and start having pretty decent conversation, but he is making very intense eye contact and making audible grunts, which made me a little uncomfortable but not enough to throw any major flags. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is wrapping up and it is time to go to the park. Like a dumbass, I agree to get into the car with a stranger an allow him to drive us there instead of following behind. So we are driving along and he is going the wrong direction to the park. I asked where we were going and he tells me he wanted to take me a mountain lookout. But the specific location he mentioned is known as a place nothing good happens. I veto that. He then tells me he wants me to meet his mother. I say no to that as well. This man pulls up to his mom’s house. I told him in not comfortable with this. He tries to reassure me by mentioning that it’s really his house, his mom just lives with him. 🙄 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the red flags finally start to make an appearance. I told him that we had agreed to a walk in the park. He reluctantly agreed and headed to the park. He was also swerving all over the road andI swear he fell asleep at least once if not twice. I wanted to just dip out, but I didn’t have my car so I had to ride it out. I convinced him to let me swing by to get my car so it wouldn’t be a hassle later. I should have bailed right then. But nooooo, me being a dumbass, I still follow him to the park. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we start walking and this man pulls his shirt off and leaves it off for the remainder of the date. Keep in mind, it’s a public park with a bunch of kids and old people. He wants us to sit on a bench to talk. We sit down. 
Y’all, this man starts to pray, LOUD af. 
About how grateful he was that I was put into his life and how much he LOVES me and he is in love with me and that I’m his girlfriend. People are walking past us just making eye contact with me as I mouth the words, “I’m so sorry”. It was so awkward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should probably mention this guy is like 6’4” at like 250+lbs. very athletic obviously works out. big enough that I knew I couldn’t take him if I ran. At this point, I was just trying to hurry it along so I could go home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start walking again and he tries to lead me to the edges of the park. The crowd is no longer granny’s and little kids. I’m stepping over needles and around homeless people. There are a bunch of abandoned buildings nearby. He said, “I’ve never been in these buildings at night, wanna check em out with me?” I said,  “NO, I think my mom is calling I need to go home. Thankfully he didn’t push it too far. 
So he walks me back to my car and as I try to slide in, as I’m swinging my feet under the dash he grabs my left foot (wearing flip flops) and proceeds to put his MOUTH on my toes. 
Yall, the gasp I gasped! 
He notices, let’s go and says, “hang on”. He is parallel parked in front of me so I can’t just leave. He digs in his truck for a while and comes back with a jacket. He throws it through my driver window all the way to the back of my SUV. Looks me dead in the eyes, serious af, and says, “just so you know, I’m very possessive of my belongings, and you are not girlfriend now”. I just looked back and said ok cool. I took tf off. I looked like Lightning McQueen pulling out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something didn’t feel right, so I pull over a few blocks over and grab the jacket. I look in the pocket and there is an Apple Air Tag inside. I threw it in the dumpster at in the parking lot and took the longest way home I could. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dates over, I’m alive! I call my bff and tell her wtf just happened. She was like, “BITCH, did you forget how to google”. I get home, put my FBI cap on and start looking. Tell me why THREE mugshots pop up, drugs, assault, and domestic violence. I also find him in one of those, “are we dating the same guy” groups. Yall, his exwife and other past partners had all the receipts. This man is crazy af. He is also in school to be an anesthesiologist! The last person I would want around while I’m unconscious! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot to mention the funniest part! While we headed to the park he pulls out a gift card for Bonefish Grill and says, “there’s a little over $14 left, do you want to go share an appetizer?” 😂😂😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I went on a date with a psychopath that tried to take me to a secluded mountain top, an abandoned building, and to meet his mom (that he lives with) on a FIRST DATE! It ended with a tracker being placed in my car! &lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"I 29M am married to a 33F. My wife is not as interested in sex in general, while I clearly want more. We have sex about once in 1.5 months so I do feel some sexual frustration. She works from home so it’s not like I can just masturbate either.

Recently, she had gone back home to see her family for a few days. I have always been curious on getting one of those 5 lb+ ass with vagina silicon toys as they seemed quite intriguing.

So, I ordered one of Amazon which said it had discrete packing to use it while she’s away. I used it 3-4 times and then decided it’s too much work to maintain one / also felt some guilt around it so I threw it in the trash before she returned home.

Now this was more than a month ago. The package as promised was indeed in discrete packing and it was discarded successfully.

However, today I received a letter in the mail from the Amazon seller soliciting a $25 gift card if I were to leave a review for this 5 lb ass and vagina combo I had ordered (with a photo of it). I know that’s against Amazon seller policies and I could report to seller but the damage is done. My wife checks the mail and she found the letter.

She shouted calling for me, and confronted me on wtf did I order showing me the paper. I quickly accepted what I had done, and told the full truth along with the fact that I had discarded it.

She was hurt by it and very angry at me. She asked me to leave the home but I didn’t want to as I said I’m already leaving for a work trip the day after.  I live in a 2 story 4 bedroom home. She packed a bag of my toiletries, towel and sheets and put them outside the room on the floor and commanded me to stay in another room downstairs. I apologized multiple times but she said she doesn’t want to be near me and that she’s disgusted by me.

In my view I bought myself a sex toy to use at my own private alone time. I’d never think of cheating on her or anything of that sort despite my sexual frustration.

Anyways, now I’m in another room of the home with an angry wife and no idea on how long (if) it might take for her to come around.

TL;DR: Bought a 5lb ass and vagina combo and threw it. Amazon seller sent a letter in mail asking for 5star review a month later that wife found.

** Update 1 (10/28) **: Wow, thanks for everyone’s input I didn’t expect this post to get so many replies but appreciate everyone! So, the times she came out of the room today, she did not look or even speak with me, she was very clear saying “get away from me” whenever I tried to speak or apologize. 

Based on the responses here, I did text her because I couldn’t speak to her. The summary of the text is, “You’re exaggerating this. You were in Vegas, and I bought myself a toy in my private time alone at home, which I even threw away. I’ve never had any sex toys, so I was curious to try one. Why would I tell you something so private about getting myself a toy while you weren’t here? I’m sorry if I upset you, but I shouldn’t be able to masturbate, especially when I’m home alone?” This text was 3 hours ago, still no reply. It seems it’s going to be another night of me and my dog sleeping in another bedroom.

** Update 2 (10/30) **: I returned back from my work trip and she was sitting in the living room watching TV. She didn’t look away the entire time and her back was facing me for the most part.

She brought some more stuff of mine from the master bathroom to the other that I’ve been using and organized it in the bathroom.

My dog was excited I was back so I put a collar on her and took her for a walk. When I returned, wife had left the living room. She spoke from a distance only 1 line for the night “there’s packages for you out front”. And then later she closed the master bedroom door. I checked the packages later, and one was some sweets she had ordered for me before this whole incident. 

I sent her a text to simply thank for the sweets that she didn’t reply to. She leaves to visit her family in Vegas again this weekend for ~2 weeks.

,tifu,"Sorry for bad grammar, english isn't my first language

So it all started yesterday (sunday) when I (18F) and my friend group planned to sleepover at my friends' (18M) house to hang out, maybe drink and smoke some weed, so I went out to buy a tobacco pipe for it.

Also, it's important that here cannabis/marijuana is taken nearly as seriously as hard drugs in the sense that you could get 2-10 years in prison depending on circumstances for *drug users* and then with suppliers it's 5-20 years *or even life sentence if it's in larger quantities*
So I just want to say that at least here it's a really big risk with a small reward to it, and that I do not recommend drug use in general.

So after I got the pipe I joined the others at my friends' place which is at the edge of town, and just kinda difficult to get to with the annoying bus schedules, and also it being at the weekend.

Later when we were getting out of it we went into the city to grab some snacks from the store and maybe grab some kfc while we're at it, and then go back to his place.

Now this is where my f*ck-up happened.

I managed to leave my bag at the god damned bus station in front of the ticket office around the evening, but we only noticed it at night 3 hours later after last bus that goes back and forth already left, and that meant a 1 hour and 30 min walk just to the bus station from there, with his parents already sleeping with absolutely no way of sneaking out to make matters worse. So in the end, we decided to call the bus company's customer service line in the morning, since if somebody wanted to take the bag, they would've done so already by the time we got back. This morning we checked the ticket and lost and found office in person, since no one picked up the customer service line (because of course), but nevertheless the bag wasn't found.

And now the dread just sets in, since I realized that in that bag were most of my clothes, my papers in preparation to graduate, a personal unreplacable gift and basically everything that wasn't my wallet or bus ticket for this month and personal cards (and obviously lost the not so cheap bag itself too which I used for school every day for just a year at this point) which suck of course, but the weed was also there, and a random envelope of gift cards with my father's name and phone number that I forgot about sometime ago.

So now I'm scared shitless that my father will get in trouble because of my f*ck-up, and my only hope is that whoever the h*ll either doesn't go through the trouble of reporting it, but I doubt it  since I don't know how ""well officer, here's some weed and an envelope with a name in some random school bag I found"" would work... 


TL;DR
Went to my friends' place to smoke weed, but on the way back lost the bag with all my stuff in it including the weed, and a gift card envelope with my father's name and number.

It was a school day but I was at home for some reason, I cant actually remember why, and the rest of my family had gone to work/school so I had the house to myself, but my dad did tell me at about midday a couple of plumbers were coming over to try and fix our water pressure and that they knew what to do so I could just ignore them which was fine by me. Come midday im lying on the couch scrolling on my phone when the plumbers arrive. And theyre actually mostly tinkering with the hot water box thingy outside, only occasionally coming in to test a tap or something, so its like they arent even there.

Now me, being a hormonal teen, all of a sudden get the urge to, yk, choke the chicken. And I enjoy doing it in big open spaces like my lounge room, it feels kinda freeing in a weird way. Plus I could hear the plumbers outside and the only way they would be able to see me is by looking through the front window, which they have no reason to do because they're out the back, or if they looked through the big glass back doors, which have very loud wooden steps leading up to them, giving me ample warning if one of them decided to come inside. So instead of retreating into the safety of my room I pick my poison and whip my shit out right then and there. Im about a minute deep when I hear footsteps, not from the wooden steps or the front window, but from inside the house. Ive never whipped my head up faster. I feel my heart sink to my stomach as I make direct eye contact with the plumber exiting my laundry room. I somehow didnt hear him at all for the  5 odd minutes he'd been in there and thought he was out tinkering with the box like the other guy. So I lock eyes with this poor plumber for like a full second, meat in hand, video blasting, and then all at once I turn off my phone and try subtly hiding my meat behind the pillows and he just turns and walks out the backdoor, which is right next to the laundry so he was gone quick. 

I obviously stopped after that but I was to ashamed to even get up and go to my room so I sat in the exact same position until they left about 20 minutes later. After they left I went and stood where he had been standing to try and gauge how much he saw, and luckily because he was looking at me from over the back of the couch, I think the pillows mostly covered up my weiner, but he definitely heard the video, and he definitely saw the position my arm was in.

,tifu,"TIFU by giving my girlfriend a black eye, almost breaking her nose.

Me (30m) and my girlfriend (35f) just started our weekend with a nice breakfast and since the weather was bad, we decided to stay in bed to watch movies. It didn't need much time until we started enjoying each other's company more than the movie. After we made out a while she went down a level to give my little buddy some attention. 
Some important information: I am very, very sensitive at my inner thighs, not just ticklish. Normal constant pressure is fine, but sensitive movements at the wrong place make my legs jerk up like they want to impress at the casting for Ong-Bak. You see where this is going...

I had warned her before about this, but in the heat of the moment she forgot and due to my blood beeing needed elsewhere my brain was too oxygen deprived to do something about it. Then she hits the wrong point and since she was beside me, my knee jumped up and hit her under her right eye.
The moment the reflex was triggered I was just merely a bystander, watching me in slow motion knee striking my girlfriends head, while already imagining the court hearing and my sentence for domestic abuse. 
Luckily she has good reflexes and so I ""just"" slightly hit her cheek. After seconds, which felt like an eternity, I controlled myself and checked on her. We applied some frozen bami goreng (we neither had frozen peas nor cool packs) and all was well afterwards. She is not too angry about it and just told me: ""This is not the right way of doing it, next time tell me before, if you want to go BDSM.""

,tifu,"So today I fucked up big time.
It all started when we got a assignment at university this March for a text of about 50 pages we have to write. 
Around that time, not related to this, I got a hard phase of depression and have been taking antidepressants since. 

The problem starts with the procrastination that came with my depression. I can't get shit done even if I want to. 

So when we had to hand the assignment in in early August I wasn't done, had a big panic attack, went to ER and university offered me one month more to get it done thankfully. So I somehow, don't ask me how got it written (mostly bad than good) but my depression and procrastination hindered me of just handing it in to get corrected. 

For context in my studies I am employed for a business in my town and kinda study for them while getting paid, working half the time for them and studying half the time. (It's a dual system)

So I got my papers handed in to the university but not my employer who is supposed to correct it. I start working on the presentation for the assignment and a month later, last week my employer rightfully asks where my assignment is since university asked them for their correction.

So now university calls me and says the assignment I send them is corrupted and I have to resend it to them. 

I always have a backup of my files on 3 seperate devices (my Pc at home, my Laptop at work and a USB stick in my bag) and I thought this might be enough but no.
Each and every file related to this assignment together with some other files and folders of private things are corrupted. 

I got nothing to hand in. And since I didn't hand it in to my employer in time now they probably all think I didn't do shit and think I wanted to do whatever...

It just all looks super suspicious:
I got a later due date because of a panic attack.
I didn't hand it in in time.

,tifu,"Last night I was at a party and I didn't even necessarily have to try to avoid drinking too much bc there wasn't even that much booze. I know for a fact that I didn't have too much to drink because I usually black out in that case which didn't happen. I got home in the morning and went to bed. After waking up I had morning nausea which is typical for me if I don't emmidietly get up after waking up. I dragged myself over to the kitchen and grabbed a slice of bread. In my groggy not wanting to be awake state I thought there would be no issue with crapping while eating because I wasn't patient enough to do one at a time. I then rolled around in bed for awhile and was feeling nauseous I thought it might be a hangover so I went over to grab baking soda and drink soda water. right after taking my first sip I realized these weren't the burps of relief... I emmidietly grabbed a bowl and threw up nearly more than 12 hours after drinking which confused me so much. So I did a quick a Google and realized this wasn't my proudest crap (even tho it was pretty massive and impressive) since eating while crapping increases the amount of fecal matter consumed that is flying in the air. If anyone has any idea if that is actually why I threw up or any tips I would greatly appreciate it. (Ps. I have never gotten sick due to drinking even tho I blacked out many times)

After waking up I had morning nausea which is typical for me if I don&amp;#39;t emmidietly get up after waking up. I dragged myself over to the kitchen and grabbed a slice of bread. In my groggy not wanting to be awake state I thought there would be no issue with crapping while eating because I wasn&amp;#39;t patient enough to do one at a time. I then rolled around in bed for awhile and was feeling nauseous I thought it might be a hangover so I went over to grab baking soda and drink soda water. right after taking my first sip I realized these weren&amp;#39;t the burps of relief... I emmidietly grabbed a bowl and threw up nearly more than 12 hours after drinking which confused me so much. So I did a quick a Google and realized this wasn&amp;#39;t my proudest crap (even tho it was pretty massive and impressive) since eating while crapping increases the amount of fecal matter consumed that is flying in the air. If anyone has any idea if that is actually why I threw up or any tips I would greatly appreciate it. (Ps. I have never gotten sick due to drinking even tho I blacked out many times)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tldr. In my groggy not even that hangover state I was so lazy that I ate while crapping, which probably was the reason why I threw up right after drinking water with baking soda.&lt;/p&gt;

Long Version

My girlfriend has an issue with my use of baby powder so I looked for an alternative solution and came up with spray on body powder. The bathroom was regularly covered in baby powder so understandingly she pressured me to find something else. 

I acquired the suspect of this unfortunate incident and started to apply it to my ball and my girlfriend offered and helped me spray in on my balls and hole, the pain, the unbearable pain, and worst of all, I showered and sprayed hot water under pressure onto the effected areas, I would never subject my worst enemy to this pain.

My lovely girlfriend was laughing her ass off while I was grunting and suffering in pain while in the shower and turning red like a tomato. Ive had fire diarrhea before but that didn’t even come close to the pain I’ve felt during this experience. Plus I got strep, man this some bullshit, I got strep and fire balls.

,tifu,"I (18F) just wanted to say that I don't regret most of my actions, but it was definitely a fuck up. My sister(16F) got grounded by our mom (50F) because of her grades. Personally, I think it's bullshit because my sister has mostly As and Bs (she used to have worst grades last year, BUT SHE'S LEARNED HER LESSON AFTER GETTING GROUNDED FOR GETTING A D/C). But since my mom expects ""perfection"" VIA all As, my sister got grounded. I don't think it's fair at all - official semester report cards haven't even come out and she's basing my sister's achievements based off of constantly updating grades. I know some of her teachers like to give everyone in their classes 0s on certain assignments to encourage/remind students to do their schoolwork as well (BECAUSE I TOOK THEIR CLASSES!!). It sucks ass, and I think my mom was being to harsh on that.

Back to the story! So, my sister, and her friend (16F), asked me to take them to the library. Since I didn't have anything better to do, I decided to agree to drive them to the library. I got my laptop and then we drove to the library. It was pretty productive. I saw them take notes (well, mostly. I could tell they were messing around a few times) and I was in the corner writing for a personal project. Another friend dropped by, and then they all wanted to go to another friend's place. I mean, I just shrugged and rolled with it. We've been to this friend's place before, so what's the worst that could happen, right?

Long story short, we lost track of time. Our mom noticed and knew that the library was probably closed (closed at 5, we were still out by 6:30) By the time we got home, she was pretty pissed. We both got grounded for the rest of the month and I'm now not allowed to drive anywhere besides school and/or to drop off my sister.

Do I regret it? Not really - I think my mom's reasoning for grounding my sister was unfair. (...Might be because of my own anger at being treated poorly because of the high standards of consistently getting As. I know how much grades are starting to affect my sister because of our mom and typical school pressures. She has a good social life and I don't want her to end up like me.) The most I'm sad about is that since I'm grounded, I can't go out and do club activities and go to social events. Sucks since I'm in college and a commuter, which means I can't really connect with my college as much as I used to, plus all extracurricular activities are at night.

But sucks to be me, I guess. Even though I don't regret it, I wish I was at least a little more conscious about it.

(Btw there's only one thing I agree with my mom about this whole situation - It was pretty late. My sister does have school tomorrow - I do too, but I have afternoon classes. But other than that, the reason for grounding is something I didn't agree with AND I was there to supervise. Ugh, maybe it's just that late teenage rebellion my mom thinks I have :/)

,tifu,"Obligatory ""Didn't happen today.""

When I was 19 and attending my hometown's junior (2-year) college, I became good friends with two non-traditional students, Ann and Hillary, in a class we shared. They were in their early-mid 30s. We stayed friends after our shared class ended, occasionally catching up at the same restaurant where we'd eat after class.

Ann was a bit eccentric but a sweetheart. She'd invite me on trips with her daughters, who were roughly ages 11 and 13. Wanting me to ""see more of the country,"" she invited me to her sister's out-of-state wedding, when her husband couldn't go and wouldn't take their girls out of school in January (important later).

I moved on to attend university, but a couple years after college graduation, I moved back to my hometown to work at the newspaper. Hillary had moved, but Ann and I caught up at our old regular restaurant. I took some senior portraits for her oldest daughter who was now graduating high school, and after that, we kinda drifted.

Working at the local newspaper means seeing **all** the courthouse records published in the paper. And when Ann's youngest daughter was **just 18** , I saw her in the list of new marriage licenses! Ann's daughter Lucy had pretty standard first and middle names. But back when the girls were little on one of those daytrips, they talked about how, after giving birth, Ann was so out of it, her husband misspelled Lucy's middle name accidentally or otherwise on the birth certificate. 

So seeing Lucy's name in the recent marriage licenses was solid, could-not-be-mistaken for someone else with that name proof ... And to be honest, Ann was known to fib to make some stories sound cooler, so it was also kinda proof that Lucy's name story was not one of those fibs.

Well what do you do when an old friend whose kids you knew as littles has a kid GETTING MARRIED? You message her, ""Looks like congrats are in order, Mother of the bride!"" With a bunch of smiley faces.

A confused? Ann responded that both her girls were single! She said she'd pass along my congrats to her brother, who was married that week. Back when I was Ann's plus-one at her sister's wedding, I'd met her parents and all her siblings, so she thought (or hoped) I just meant him.

Meanwhile MY brain immediately started saying, ""fuck, fuck, fuck fuck fuuuuuuck."" It's so crystal clear with 20/20 hindsight that this was a land mine ... Lucy was **barely 18.** At the time, yeah girl was young, but I had classmates who got married at 18. It never occured to me LUCY GOT MARRIED BEHIND HER PARENTS' BACKS. IN SECRET. And it apparently didn't occur to Romeo and Juliet that modern marriages are published in the local paper. 

I couldn't lie and say I had the wrong Lucy, again with the middle name thing. So I just told Ann how odd it was a Lucy Middlename Lastname, of the same age, was in this week's marriage licenses. Ann responded, ""wishful thinking on the boy's part. Lucy told him no.""

I let Ann have it and just said, ""Ahh."" Knowing, There. Is. No. Way. a boy, man, woman or anyone can file for and receive a whole ass marriage license with the other party in absentia. That's not how it works. But poor Ann now had bigger worries and I wasn't about to call her out even more. 

Later Lucy herself messaged the newspaper social media accounts asking if we could unpublish the marriage license, as there'd been a mistake and it was no longer relevant. She didn't try and say she'd *rejected* it altogether like her mom did. Nor did she argue the accuracy or anything ... So I knew Ann trying to save face was just that, and Lucy did, in fact, sign a marriage license at some point. The newspaper did not, ever, remove public records, including this time. 

I never heard what happened to Lucy and Romeo, whether they'd already broken up by the time the record was published or made to by their parents, or something else? I sure as shit wasn't going to ask. I do know they did not stay married.

Ann sent me some copy/paste ""pass this on"" thing at some point, and I gave her a salon suggestion in response to a post, but we never had a full conversation again. Some time later I noticed a blue, ""Add Friend"" button by her name. It would have been cool to keep in touch on social media but knowing we'd all but drifted, and coupled with that mortifying (for us both) exchange, the friendship was probably meant to fade. 

TL;DR: I knew the young daughters of an old college friend who was a little older than me.

Well he texted me the other day! He said he still loves me and a whole bunch of other stuff and I was really happy! But I told him I need to focus on my recovery right now. I need to focus on figuring my shit out and work on not being that person anymore, then maybe we can try dating again if he still wants to. He's got his kids now and I don't want to go back and relapse and his kids have to see that. I didn't tell him all of that, but I told him he's top of my list for making amends and I hope he answers.

I'm doing better, about to have a job, I've made a few friends, almost on track I guess. I'm super surprised he still wants me back, got lucky there I guess. I don't know if I should get back with him though. He's just so great and I've put him through a lot over the years so I don't know if that's the right decision. I want to at least finish the program though first. Been going to counseling and talking to my therapist and I feel like I've been doing better.

,tifu,"I've always thought I was a lesbian, but I've been working at this place for about eight months now, and in that time, I’ve grown close to a particular coworker, let’s call him Josh.

Josh (25M) and I (19F) have been talking a lot for about six months. We have so much in common: we like the same music, have read the same books, and share similar tastes in shows and movies. We even agree on most opinions about them. We clicked very quickly and started chatting on Instagram about a week after meeting. A month later, we exchanged numbers.

I started feeling more infatuated with Josh when he began giving me little gifts, like chocolate bars and truffles. Once, when we were discussing our favorite superheroes, he mentioned his was Superman, and I said I loved Spiderman. For his birthday in May, I gifted him a Superman keychain—a small gesture, just so he wouldn’t feel unnoticed. Then, on my birthday in June, he surprised me with Spiderman socks (which were adorable). By then, I was completely smitten.

Josh is charming, with curly, long hair, a cute goatee, and a fit physique from working out. He’s also respectful, kind, hardworking, has a smooth voice, and a genuinely pretty smile. Not surprisingly, almost everyone at work has fallen for him at some point. Some people still are, though he doesn’t pay it much attention.

As we got closer, he confided in me that he’s bi—something nobody else knows. He also opened up about his best friend, ""Ben"" (25M), whom he once was in love with. I suspect he still has feelings for Ben, though he denies it. Ben doesn’t seem like the best friend, though; he doesn’t work (he gets an allowance from his parents), lives with his grandma, and spends his money on partying and video games. He’s often disrespectful, frequently making inappropriate comments about women’s bodies and how he gets ""horny"" for them. When Ben is struggling mentally (he has anxiety), he either demands Josh’s attention or ghosts him for months. But when Josh is going through something, Ben just says he ""can’t stop his life to take care of him.""

Josh clearly holds some resentment toward Ben, especially since, after rejecting Josh’s confession of love four years ago, Ben began using him as an ego boost, constantly reminding Josh that if he (Ben) wanted something more, Josh would “crawl back to him”.

Last month, I got tired of holding onto this little crush and decided to tell Josh how I felt. I figured that if he felt the same way, great; if not, I could finally move on. I told him over text since we rarely have privacy at work. I admitted that I liked him and wanted to tell him before my feelings grew out of control. His response was honest—he said he’s very confused and is almost certain he’s gay. If he is, he said he wouldn’t want to hurt me while figuring that out. So, I decided to move on, and we agreed to stay friends.

The challenge is that Josh is my only friend in a very hostile work environment, so we’re always together. I worry that my feelings are evolving from a simple crush into something deeper.

What’s more, I’m starting to feel some resentment toward him. Recently, he started talking about a girl from his gym he’s interested in, even wanting to buy her an expensive box of chocolates for her birthday. Ironically, this girl is currently seeing his best friend, Ben, and now he likes and resent both of them.

Now, people at work are starting to think that Josh and I are seeing each other; they gossip among themselves and give us suggestive looks when we’re together. These looks put us both in a very awkward position.

So, Reddit, what should I do? Should I work on getting over it? Should I distance myself and try to move on?

I don’t blame him for being confused about his sexuality—I am too, sometimes—but this situation is starting to affect my self-esteem. Thank you all for reading.

TL;DR: I have feelings for my confused friend, but now I’m starting to resent him for liking other girls instead of me.

Recently, he started talking about a girl from his gym he’s interested in, even wanting to buy her an expensive box of chocolates for her birthday. Ironically, this girl is currently seeing his best friend, Ben, and now he likes and resent both of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, people at work are starting to think that Josh and I are seeing each other; they gossip among themselves and give us suggestive looks when we’re together. These looks put us both in a very awkward position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Reddit, what should I do? Should I work on getting over it? Should I distance myself and try to move on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t blame him for being confused about his sexuality—I am too, sometimes—but this situation is starting to affect my self-esteem. Thank you all for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I have feelings for my confused friend, but now I’m starting to resent him for liking other girls instead of me.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"I (39 M) want to preface this with the fact that I've NEVER harmed anyone nor do I have any intentions to do so. With that in mind, here's what just happened. For decades, at this point, I have been telling myself (silently most times) that ""I'm going to unalive you"" to thoughts that won't leave my brain. 

It's always directed at things I'm privately embarrassed about and never a person that's not myself. For example random time when I got pranked in middle school to make it look like i peed myself that just won't go away? ""I'm going to unalive you.""  That time I sneezed so hard I sharted in the middle of talking to a girl I was crushing on and her friend who witnessed the whole thing told everybody about i? ""I'm going to unalive you."" 

Well today my lovely concoction of horribly put together thought meat decided to allow my partner (35 F), whom I've been with for 8 years to finally stumble upon my weird habit, that I've been keeping locked up tighter than Fort fucking Knox, in the worst possible timing. 

Earlier, we got into an argument (it was my fault). Hours later, after the argument was resolved and going to a friend's housewarming party, we get home sometime after midnight and we talked about things. It was a GOOD conversation and I genuinely can't stress that enough. Another important detail is that I have long hair and regularly keep it in a bun more on that soon. We wrap up our convo, I take the dogs out for the night, and I fell asleep on the couch scrolling through my phone, an often occurrence. I decided to head to bed. I was struggling with getting my hair tie out in the darkness of a room at 6 am, when the thought of my friend asking me to demonstrate a kick I learned in taekwondo and everybody in visible range laughed at me. But instead of staying in a thought bubble, like it normally does, it comes out of my mouth... with her... in bed... 5 feet away from me... next to our dresser where we keep a 🔫 for home defense. She snaps awake, obviously uncomfortable and asks me what I said. I explained to her why I do that but something that weird is just plain unbelievable so I'm sitting here flipping between freaking out and looking like I'm something I'm not whilst trying to figure out how to un-fuck this situation.

,tifu,"So, the lady that lives next for just came by to ""thank me for giving them a giggle."" The **FedEx guy** (I accidentally slandered our mail lady) accidentally delivered a package for them to my house, and ofc I was gonna go drop it off. It's, like, 30 steps round trip.

Well, I overthink everything. I set it on their porch in front of the gate that goes across their steps, and went to walk away. Then, I was like, ""oh, but I'm not sure if they're actually home right now, so what if they go to leave the house and knock it down the stairs with the gate? That wouldn't be very fun and I'd feel awful if whatever's in the box is broken...""

So I picked it up and moved it to the other side of the gate. But then I realized it was getting dark, and I didn't want them to open the gate and trip over it, so I picked it back up. I want to avoid bothering them, so coming back later when I see (or hear, because she's a borky girl) the dog let out is absolutely out of the question. At this point, I'm just holding the package and walking up to the porch and stepping back to try and gauge where the streetlight would hit their porch when it kicks on, and I eventually settle on a good spot and half run home bc thank goodness nobody's ever going to see this! 

Well, after asking what the neighbor meant by that, she explained that it was really funny to see me just basically walking in circles, especially if you speed the footage up a bit. She showed me the footage. I do, in fact, look like an idiot, but it is, in fact, kind of hilarious. At one point, it even kind of looks like I'm waltzing with the box.

tl;dr I tried to do something nice by returning a misdelivered package, ended up looking like an idiot, and may or may not end up in a TikTok with the Benny Hill theme song playing while I goofily stumble around trying to figure out where to put a box on a porch.

editing to add a couple things: First of all, I don't have the footage. My neighbor showed it to me on her phone. I didn't tell her not to post it anywhere, but my face also doesn't hide what I'm feeling so I'm pretty sure she could see that i wasn't comfortable with the whole thing. Second (due to pressure from random people in the comments), I've written her a note to see if she does plan on uploading it anywhere. If she does end up posting it, I'll add the link to this post, but as for right now I'm keeping my physical self off of Reddit as I do enjoy the fact that nobody here knows what I look like.

,tifu,"So I was with my girlfriend, enjoying a fun time of Mario Party 8 in our lounge room. We got into a minigame called ""Crank to Rank"", where the goal of each player was to ""turn the crank"" by shaking the wii remote at a rapid pace.

We both started the game, it was just us as the other 2 players were CPUs, and when it comes to shaking a wii remote, I really have to say that my gf went on, in her own words, a rampage. She shook her controller up and down like a lightning blur, and ended up winning easily.

I was a little... precarious at the time. Especially after not seeing her for so long at that point. After she won from shaking her controller so hard, I saw this as prowess from a side of her that I've never seen. The thought rushed to my head, and I acted on impulse. I immediately turned to her and said, ""You wanna pause the game real quick?"". She looked back at me, and seemed somewhat confused. I don't think she really got the idea at this point.

I decided to just take the assumption that she didn't get the idea and just say it bluntly. I mentioned to her how impressed I was that she shook her controller to turn the crank as quickly as she did. I then asked her if she could do the same thing to, well, my crank.

After this, she stared at me awkwardly, I could tell she ended up being very offended by that, as if I bluntly insulted her or something. A few seconds into that moment is when I realized ""Oh, shoot--"". She got up from her seat, and looked at me distressed. All she said at that moment was ""What is wrong with you?"" and left to go back home, without talking to me. I was too anxious at that time to say anything in response.

I messaged her later that night, hoping to resolve this incident, but she never did end up reading any of my messages. I hope I can end up apologizing for what I said.

The doctor (F) asked if i was okay with her taking a look down there so she can see what's going on. It's been bothering me for a while so I was okay with that, since I have been wanting to fix the issue. She asked me to put on a gown like a robe so I can cover up and not be exposed.

The doctor walked out so I could undress and put on the gown. Also, to go get a chaperone.

The chaperone was a young female in her 20s. She stood right next to the doctor but at an angle where I wouldn't be exposed but she could still see that everything is okay.
As I was showing the doctor, the doctor asked exactly where I felt the irritation.
I completely let go of the gown and started tossing my junk around showing her the irritation at the base of my penis on the right side. Then I face where the chaperone is standing and show her the left side too.

,tifu,"UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the supportive messages. I reached out and he ended up apologising about what happened, said he should have said something when I puked but he had a bit of a knee-jerk reaction. He was a bit afraid to reach out because he thought he pushed me into doing something I was uncomfortable with and that‘s why I ran off. I explained I was mostly embarrassed although what he did was a bit too aggressive for my first time. He was sorry for that too, said he had a bit too much to drink as well and wasn’t being considerate. He offered to make it up to me by taking me out to dinner and having a proper date.

Story:

I met a guy last night at the grocery store while I was buying a bottle of wine for a party. My costume had no pockets so I forgot to bring ID with me. The cashier was being difficult and wouldn’t let me buy it so I just left.

The guy behind me in line bought the wine and chased after me to handed it off to me. He complimented my choice and chatted with me while I headed over to my friend‘s place. He was hitting on me pretty hard - asking me if I had a boyfriend, etc., I was using my boy voice the whole time but since I was fully made up and dressed like Velma from Scooby-Doo, I told him I was trans to be sure but he could already tell. I found him very fun and charming, so I let him have my number when we parted ways and he asked for it.

I meet up with my friends, and we have a few drinks before heading to the party. I had been really excited about this because it was a genderbent party. I’m in the closet and boymode most of the time to avoid my parents finding out via social media, so having a chance to be fem presenting without anyone finding out was pretty awesome for me.

The party was a big university event and we had to queue to get inside. Unfortunately we arrived too late and couldn’t get in. We queued for a bit on the off chance there was extra capacity, but eventually gave up and headed to another club. There were three of us, and one friend ended up running off with a girl he met. When my other friend left for the washroom a guy started grinding up on me while I was dancing. I was a bit tipsy and my favourite song was on so I leaned into it. Unfortunately he got a bit handsy and clocked that I had boy parts. He backed off immediately and shouted “WTF” - and I just ran out of the club without looking back.

This was quickly turning into the worst night of my life. The guy from the grocery store had been texting me, and we had a bit of a back and forth all night, especially when I was queuing. He bragged a lot about his wine collection and invited me over. At this point I was ready to head home, but I lived on the other side of town and really needed to pee. I didn’t really want to head into a public men’s bathroom dressed as sexy Velma, so I figured I would stop for one drink, use his toilet, and head home.

I stopped by his place, fully transparent I am only doing this for a bio break. We had one drink, but we started talking about ourselves and I felt myself really opening up to him. So I stayed for another. He was really sweet, understanding, and mature. I also clued in that I had met him before because I came to his cafe several months ago. He was flirty back then too.

I told him some really personal stuff and cried a little bit. He hugged me and we cuddled on the couch for a bit before he finally kissed me. Things got pretty heated, and I got a bit testy when he touched my boy parts - I explained to him it was connected to a traumatic experience I told him about and it really triggers me. He backed off, but I could still see that he had a raging hard on.

I really liked him and I didn’t want to leave him unsatisfied or make it seem like I didn’t want him so I got down on my knees to give him head. It was actually the first time I ever did something like this so I was terrible. My teeth kept getting in the way and I could hear him get frustrated.

I told him I was sorry and this was my first time but I really wanted him to feel good, so he sighed and told me to stick out my tongue. He then grabbed me by the head and started throat fucking me. I was gagging a lot but I could tell he enjoyed it so I let him keep going.

But when he came it was too much, there was a huge wave of nausea and I projectile vomited all over his lap. We’d been eating snacks the whole time so it was a lot, it got all over his junk, his clothes, and sofa.

I reached out and he ended up apologising about what happened, said he should have said something when I puked but he had a bit of a knee-jerk reaction. He was a bit afraid to reach out because he thought he pushed me into doing something I was uncomfortable with and that‘s why I ran off. I explained I was mostly embarrassed although what he did was a bit too aggressive for my first time. He was sorry for that too, said he had a bit too much to drink as well and wasn’t being considerate. He offered to make it up to me by taking me out to dinner and having a proper date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met a guy last night at the grocery store while I was buying a bottle of wine for a party. My costume had no pockets so I forgot to bring ID with me. The cashier was being difficult and wouldn’t let me buy it so I just left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy behind me in line bought the wine and chased after me to handed it off to me. He complimented my choice and chatted with me while I headed over to my friend‘s place. He was hitting on me pretty hard - asking me if I had a boyfriend, etc., I was using my boy voice the whole time but since I was fully made up and dressed like Velma from Scooby-Doo, I told him I was trans to be sure but he could already tell. I found him very fun and charming, so I let him have my number when we parted ways and he asked for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I meet up with my friends, and we have a few drinks before heading to the party. I had been really excited about this because it was a genderbent party. I’m in the closet and boymode most of the time to avoid my parents finding out via social media, so having a chance to be fem presenting without anyone finding out was pretty awesome for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party was a big university event and we had to queue to get inside. Unfortunately we arrived too late and couldn’t get in. We queued for a bit on the off chance there was extra capacity, but eventually gave up and headed to another club. There were three of us, and one friend ended up running off with a girl he met. When my other friend left for the washroom a guy started grinding up on me while I was dancing. I was a bit tipsy and my favourite song was on so I leaned into it. Unfortunately he got a bit handsy and clocked that I had boy parts. He backed off immediately and shouted “WTF” - and I just ran out of the club without looking back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was quickly turning into the worst night of my life. The guy from the grocery store had been texting me, and we had a bit of a back and forth all night, especially when I was queuing. He bragged a lot about his wine collection and invited me over. At this point I was ready to head home, but I lived on the other side of town and really needed to pee. I didn’t really want to head into a public men’s bathroom dressed as sexy Velma, so I figured I would stop for one drink, use his toilet, and head home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped by his place, fully transparent I am only doing this for a bio break. We had one drink, but we started talking about ourselves and I felt myself really opening up to him. So I stayed for another. He was really sweet, understanding, and mature. I also clued in that I had met him before because I came to his cafe several months ago. He was flirty back then too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him some really personal stuff and cried a little bit. He hugged me and we cuddled on the couch for a bit before he finally kissed me. Things got pretty heated, and I got a bit testy when he touched my boy parts - I explained to him it was connected to a traumatic experience I told him about and it really triggers me. He backed off, but I could still see that he had a raging hard on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked him and I didn’t want to leave him unsatisfied or make it seem like I didn’t want him so I got down on my knees to give him head. It was actually the first time I ever did something like this so I was terrible. My teeth kept getting in the way and I could hear him get frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him I was sorry and this was my first time but I really wanted him to feel good, so he sighed and told me to stick out my tongue. He then grabbed me by the head and started throat fucking me. I was gagging a lot but I could tell he enjoyed it so I let him keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when he came it was too much, there was a huge wave of nausea and I projectile vomited all over his lap. We’d been eating snacks the whole time so it was a lot, it got all over his junk, his clothes, and sofa. He ran off to the bathroom to wash himself off immediately, and I felt so embarrassed I just left home while he was in there without saying a word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked him, but I feel like I ruined everything. I don’t know what I should even do at this point. Should I text him sorry for leaving him with a giant pile of puke? Should I just forget this whole sorry episode and move on? It was cathartic to write this out at least. I feel a bit less humiliated, thanks for listening.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"Im a dumbass 

I’m in Uni,
I was having trouble on this assignment and told my professor that it’d be submitted late, to which he said was okay. 

The platform on which we use to submit late assignments allows for assignments to be submitted up to a full day late (to which they will be given a late tag) and not a single minute more.

I emailed my professor at about 8 asking whether or not I could submit late, and he said I could (the assignment is due at 9). I continued to work on the project from 8 so I could submit as much as I could come the deadline. While working on the project, I lost track of time and didn’t realize until 8:59 that it was time to submit. I quickly went to go submit and JUST as I was about to hit submit, the clock strikes 9:01 and the website automatically shut down submissions. 

I emailed my professor again at 9:01 telling him that I was a minute late to the deadline and how sorry I was and asked him if he could reopen it so I could submit. He said he could, and that he’d open up submission until 9:30, however it was very careless considering that we had discussed submitting for the deadline. 

After I had sent my email asking him to open the submission, I had logged off my computer for a second to take a break. I logged back in my computer and didn’t see his newest email until 9:33…

In a panic I emailed him apologizing PROFUSELY and attached my work for him to at least have something to look at. 

He just recently replied stating that thanks to the timestamps he at least knows that I wasn’t lying, however I could feel his frustration through the screen.

I’m currently still very behind on this assignment and now have a scheduled meeting with him on Monday to go over some of it, but now I’m worried that I’ve skewed my relationship with this professor who I think is honestly a really good guy.

,tifu,"Super TL;DR It's a poop story

Just happened

Bandit, our puppy, got the snip at the start of the week and had been nearly perfect when it comes to messing with the effected area. Recently he had been going for it when he gets sleepy.

We did get a donut cone and even though Bandit seemed ok he was having issues getting into some of his nap spots and playing with some chews. I heard about recovery onesies so I thought I'd grab one to make things a bit more comfortable for him.

On top of Bandit being more comfortable the onesie looked like Freddy Kruegers sweater, and being a horror fan I liked it.  It also fit with the little monsters puppy phase.

When it finally got here i put Bandit in it and showed my spouse....then I got distracted for I swear not even 5 minutes then I hear his little ""I'm having a difficult poop"" yelp and at first I reacted like it was a regular accident then I remembered he was wearing a damn onesie and pooping.

When I found him some had come out of the tail hole already in a poop trail from the basement to the front door. I carefully took off the the butt flap and you guessed it some more poop fell out. 

I lost it.

Full 5year old giggle fit which only made things worse because Bandit thought it was playtime. He preceded to step in the poop that fell out of the onesie and tracked it all over a 3ish square foot area while trying to play.

&lt;p&gt;Just happened&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bandit, our puppy, got the snip at the start of the week and had been nearly perfect when it comes to messing with the effected area. Recently he had been going for it when he gets sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did get a donut cone and even though Bandit seemed ok he was having issues getting into some of his nap spots and playing with some chews. I heard about recovery onesies so I thought I&amp;#39;d grab one to make things a bit more comfortable for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of Bandit being more comfortable the onesie looked like Freddy Kruegers sweater, and being a horror fan I liked it.  It also fit with the little monsters puppy phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it finally got here i put Bandit in it and showed my spouse....then I got distracted for I swear not even 5 minutes then I hear his little &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m having a difficult poop&amp;quot; yelp and at first I reacted like it was a regular accident then I remembered he was wearing a damn onesie and pooping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I found him some had come out of the tail hole already in a poop trail from the basement to the front door. I carefully took off the the butt flap and you guessed it some more poop fell out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost it.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"So to give some context, my next door apartment neighbor has a pretty big family living in a 2x2 apartment.  I have a GSD dog and they have a small dog and a large dog, breed I am unsure of maybe some kind of pit bull or terrier or something I'm not sure. The entire family sucks with dogs, and the little one has shot out and circled around me and my dog multiple times before, but nothing has happened.

 Fast forward to last Thursday morning (2 days ago) I was 10 feet from my door against the wall that lines all the apartments. As I pass their door, I see their large dog shoot out (they were unloading groceries) and come at my dog, they growl and tussle, and then he darts back inside when two woman yelled at him. They apologized and i checked my dog and didn't see anything, so I continued with my life. A little later i see blood pooling on her chest. I clean the wound and it visibly looks like a dog bite. I tried to contact them about their dogs rabies/vaccine status, and  they weren't home. 

Unfortunately, my ring camera unpaired from my wifi since it went down after the recent hurricane in  florida and we haven't re paired it, and none of my neighbors cameras got the incident. So im stuck with no proof and I'm pretty upset at this point because of this whole ordeal.

This is where I fuck up big time, I'm throwing some trash out and see one of the women that was there and a boy who i know live in the apartment in question, and my emotions got the absolute best of me. I called her out and told her that her dog bit mine, and that this is unacceptable and I expect her to cover vet costs. she starts denying it and I (VERY STUPIDLY) tell her that I do have proof, she requests to see the proof, I deny it. She starts saying her dog just wanted to play, and that set me off completely, i started name calling, calling her the R word, saying she must be stupid and that her dog hurt mine and i don't play around about that. 

We went back into our apartments all upset, and the regret and realization has just kicked in that i made this situation a billion times worse for everyone involved and I am just such a moron. I really want to apologize but I am afraid of going over there because i don't want them to think i am going to continue arguing, I just want both of out dogs to be ok and healthy I don't care about anything else.

I wanted to post this just to calm down and to also ask for advice, and before you comment, yes I know I am a complete idiot and an asshole for blowing up like that without even having evidence that it happened.

,tifu,"I am a college student living in Korea. (Sorry if my English is awkward)

I have some tests next week, so I stayed at school for a long time studying in the library. So I was very very tired, and honestly, I think I was kinda out of my mind.

I was walking down the hall to get home, and the view outside the window was so beautiful. The sun was setting. But I couldn't fully see the view because of the iron railing on the window. 

I looked around and there was no one there, so I tuck my head into the railing and enjoyed the sunset for a moment. (Now that I think about it, I just had to come outdoor and see it...) It was the perfect gap to put my head in.

After a while, I was satisfied and wanted to go home. But my head didn't come out. It was easy when I came in, but not when I left.  I struggled.

I was in panic. Should I call 119(In the States, it's 911)? How do I explain it when I call them? ""Help me, my head stuck in the railing""? They're going to come here with loud with sirens... Then the balloon will go up... Everytime(Social media used by Korean university students.) must be full of mockery about me...

Then, unfortunately, someone walked from over there. He was my senior in same major,  not very close to me... I thought to myself, I looked like a cow in a farm eating past the fence.

He asked me what I was doing there. I smiled awkwardly and said I was watching the view. He asked me if I was okay. I was embarassed, so I just said that I was going to watch a little more and then leave. He left, tilting his head.

I just had to ask him for help, because even after that, I couldn't pull my head out while a few more people passed by. And after struggling for a long time, I found the perfect angle and pulled my head out. Then I came back home as fast I could.

,tifu,"Well, this is really dumb one that I really should have saw coming. I was just watching some episodes of *Law &amp; Order* and absentmindedly playing around some clutter on my desk, which included a ruler, a pair of scissors, and two rechargeable AA batteries. I took a look at them and thought about whether I could complete a circuit using them.

So I placed the batteries on opposite ends of the ruler (one with the negative terminal down and one balanced with the positive terminal down), and then connected the top using the pair of scissors.

Nothing happened, because I was holding the scissors by the plastic handle, so I just held it there for about a minute before I got bored and took the scissors off.

I noticed the batteries got pretty warm, so I thought ""hmmm, I wonder if the scissors are also hot"" and touched the part of the scissors that were connected to the battery terminal.

**VERY BAD IDEA**. As it turns out, stainless steal is really electrically conductive. Some napkin-maths calculations shows that Ohm's law would have indicated 300 amps of current was flowing through those scissors, although I doubt the batteries could have actually output this amount, but it does mean I was feeling the full force of two double-A batteries heating up a piece of metal for a full minute.

So yes, the blade of that pair of scissors got extremely hot and I burned my finger.

,tifu,"Reddit keeps removing all my update posts, so for the record Reddit gods, this is a standalone post with no connection to anything I've shared on here before. This literally happened a few hours ago. I was masturbating in my room when my gf walked in. We have an open policy when it comes to masturbating. If sex with each other is not an option for whatever reason, then getting off on your own is totally acceptable, regardless if the other person is present. My gf approached me while I was masturbating, which I thought was gonna lead to her helping me out in some way, but she just wanted to see what kind of porn I was watching on my phone.

I was on the cusp of climaxing when my gf casually mentioned that the young porn star I was watching was no longer alive and apparently her death was directly related to her experience in the porn industry. My orgasm instantly fizzled out when I was about to cum, which caused my dick to fucking spasm like I was ejaculating, even though I was not. It looked and felt like I was shooting blanks because technically I was. All I could do was accept defeat and hopelessly stare at my dick twitching repeatedly until it gradually deflated. I thanked my gf for totally killing my orgasm. She shrugged and said at least my orgasm was the only thing that died, unlike the poor girl I almost got off to. 

Lesson learned: stop masturbating in front of my gf unless I am 100% sure no dead people are involved. 

TL:DR Masturbated in front of my gf, which I thought was gonna lead to her helping me out, but instead she commented on the porn I was watching and made me aware that one of the actors in the video had died, which instantly killed my orgasm and left me feeling disappointed in my life choices, specifically my decision to masturbate in front of my gf.

This literally happened a few hours ago. I was masturbating in my room when my gf walked in. We have an open policy when it comes to masturbating. If sex with each other is not an option for whatever reason, then getting off on your own is totally acceptable, regardless if the other person is present. My gf approached me while I was masturbating, which I thought was gonna lead to her helping me out in some way, but she just wanted to see what kind of porn I was watching on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was on the cusp of climaxing when my gf casually mentioned that the young porn star I was watching was no longer alive and apparently her death was directly related to her experience in the porn industry. My orgasm instantly fizzled out when I was about to cum, which caused my dick to fucking spasm like I was ejaculating, even though I was not. It looked and felt like I was shooting blanks because technically I was. All I could do was accept defeat and hopelessly stare at my dick twitching repeatedly until it gradually deflated. I thanked my gf for totally killing my orgasm. She shrugged and said at least my orgasm was the only thing that died, unlike the poor girl I almost got off to. &lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"I started going to anime and comic conventions because I love anime and video games. 

Last week I went to the comic con in the javits center 

I saw so many guys much less attractive than me, with really attractive girls. I was so shocked and felt so much envy. 

It truly made me feel so much worse about myself. I also looked at their social media and they seemed to genuinely like each other. What bothers me even more is that some of these geeky nerdy guys also had other relationships/girlffiends before and it makes me feel even fucking worse 

I tried improving myself a lot. I lost weight, am in much better shape, I got a higher paying job at JFK airport, I got new hobbies, and it truly means nothing. I always get rejected and ghosted.

,tifu,"I wanted to surprise my man while he was at work today so I did a lil photoshoot of “the girls”. For once I was satisfied with the first photo, so it was going pretty well by this point. I’ll admit though I like to play around with filters that change the grain/saturation/contrast/etc not the ones that completely change the way I look but the ones that make it look artsy ya know? 

So I was searching the filters trying to find the right one that showcased these little ladies without being too much. I finally found a combo I was satisfied with and I sent the snap to my man. Well I have a toddler who needed me for something so I locked my phone and went to deal with her. 

A while later I unlocked my phone and it opened back up to Snapchat back where it would have been after I took the photo but hadn’t sent it yet. I wasn’t expecting it to do this because I already sent it and so my thumb was already going towards the screen to do whatever I was going to do on what I was expecting to be my home screen. I ended up pressing the add to story button before I even realized I was still in Snapchat. Not just my story but my public story at that. I tried to delete it as quickly as possible and it wasn’t up long but anyone who gets notifications for my stories would’ve got a notification for it and would have been able to see it if they opened the notification. I know this because my baby daddy called to tell me I had posted it just as I deleted it. 

It could’ve been worse and at least it was a good picture but still I’m so embarrassed. I feel like such an idiot. And I don’t even wanna know how many people saw it. I wanna crawl in a hole and die of embarrassment.

I can’t believe I did that, I feel like such an idiot.

For anyone who cares: my ultimate goal was I thought this was a funny story that people would enjoy as much as we did. The fact that it didn’t turn out that way sucks a little, then again I knew reddit could be harsh. I thought this could’ve been a nice breather from the unending negative ones. 

…..

TLDR; don’t skinny dip kids. Husband &amp; I locked ourselves out of a cabin &amp; I was stark naked. Thankfully we managed to find one unlocked door.


Maybe NSFW? Involves nudity but nothing really explicit is described.

Anyway… Basically… the title… but let me explain. 

So my husband (34M) and myself (27F) got married earlier this year and went on our honeymoon shortly after. We have quite a few financially taxing plans coming up in the next few months so we decided to take a short honeymoon to a cabin on a lake.

It was absolutely beautiful and we would love to have another stay here again. Our favorite parts about this trip are the fact that it was on a lake, had a barbeque and firepit as well as a hot tub on an outside deck with an overview of the lake. Little did I know this trip would’ve been memorable for a completely other reason…

So, it’s our honeymoon. There’s a hottub. Yes, I wanted to relax without the restrictions of a bathing suit and it was very freeing and exhilarating. I loved it.

On our last day I went ahead and popped in the tub. My husband was grabbing some spare towels and followed me out afterwards shutting the door behind him. The house was old so it shifted a little weird after it was closed so my husband just tugged gently and tried to make sure it was fully closed. All of a sudden… this is what he says:

Hubs: “Babe??? Did you lock the door?”
Me: “No?”

Husband continued jiggling the doorknob and looked at me like a deer in headlights. The door appeared to be locked. 

At first, I thought he was joking. Now my husband is rather silly, he is the funniest person I know in my life and he is the kind that likes to prank me, of course it’s all in good fun. But this made me skeptical of being gullible. I thought this was one of those moments.

I told him that’s hilarious and to open the door and come get naked in the tub with me (he had his swim trunks on where I left my swimwear inside). He didn’t let up. He told me he wasn’t joking and that the door was really locked and he had no clue how. For a solid 2 minutes I didn’t believe him until he was maniacally pulling and pushing and twisting on the door knob in exaggerated motions demanding he was not joking.

My stomach sank and I felt my eyes get the same deer in headlights look. Here we were, in an AirBNB cabin in the middle of nowhere, with our cellphones locked inside and me wearing my birthday suit. I felt like a little child where my parents just spanked me and started inwardly panicking. I kept picturing scenarios in my head where the only option we had would be to pad barefooted wearing nothing but a damn towel to the next door neighbors cabin half a mile down and hope that someone was there to be able to call for help. 

I jumped out of the tub and wrapped myself in a towel when I remembered: we left the cabin earlier to grab some food and came back and my husband forgot his phone in the car. His ankle was injured at the time and the walk to the car while not too far was still enough that I offered to get it for him so he wouldn’t be hobbling on his hurt foot much longer. I have a habit of locking doors once we get inside (how we managed to get into this predicament)… but I didn’t remember locking the front door after grabbing his phone because I went to hand it to him immediately. 

I prayed that door was open, prayed that I hadn’t locked the front door and wouldn’t have to be naked except a towel in the middle of nowhere to walk to a strangers house. Of course, I still had to check to make sure he wasn’t messing with me and turns out the door really was locked. (Yes, I still doubted him, he is a big trickster sometimes.) He stared at me with a bewildered look on his face before shouting sarcastically “YES. IT’S REALLY LOCKED!” (In a humorous way, he never really gets mad, the only feelings we felt at that moment was a mix of hilarious hysteria and panic in this situation)

I went around the deck to the front door (it wrapped around the house) and held my breath as I turned the knob. The door… opened. 

I could breathe again. I waddled my naked butt inside and shut the front door, locking it behind me, and walked to the back door leading to the hottub to unlock it. My husband was watching me and simultaneously having a panic attack as he watched me lock the door behind me and was probably also praying I wouldn’t be dumb enough to lock us out again.

Lucky for him he married a woman that had some brains. They just come late to the party sometimes.

All self-deprecating jokes aside, we felt dead relieved that I didn’t have to show up to a strangers house naked. And we died laughing about this after the terror was over. 😂 

Fast forward to our checkout: we were wrapping up everything reading over the AirBNB’s requests for setting everything up for the cleaning crew and upon rereading the binder, we discovered that they had a spare key hidden under a fake rock by the garage………. Would’ve been nice to know while I was panicking outside in the nude….

,tifu,"So, this happened a couple of days ago, and my wife still isn’t letting me live it down.

I’ve always been the type to mess with my wife for a laugh (don’t worry, she messes with me right back). Recently, I discovered this very specific “hack” to get snacks without triggering her supersonic snack radar. Somehow, whenever I tried to sneak a snack from the pantry, she'd hear the slightest crinkle of the bag from another room. Like, I could sneeze right next to her, and she wouldn’t bat an eye, but crinkle a chip bag and she’s there in seconds, giving me *the look.* That’s when “crinkle karma” was born.

I decided to *invent* something I called “crinkle karma.” I told her that every time you crinkle a snack bag and *don’t share*, crinkle karma will come for you. Basically, crinkle karma would curse you to spill something, get a stain, or just embarrass yourself snack-wise. She gave me a look like, “You’re full of it,” but seemed slightly intrigued. So, crinkle karma became our household joke, and I started tossing it around whenever she gave me that look.

Fast forward to a few nights later. I’m in the kitchen, barely moving, trying to *avoid the wrath of crinkle karma* by opening a bag of chips *as silently as possible*. My wife walks in and gives me this sneaky smile before whispering, “Shhh, crinkle karma.” She actually believed it enough to come get a handful of my chips, guilt-free. At that point, I’m convinced that maybe crinkle karma has some real power over her—*and maybe me too.*

Cut to another day or so later. I’m sitting at my computer with a secret stash of Oeros, operating in complete stealth mode to avoid crnkle karma's curse. I’m taking each cookie out slowly, trying to be crinkle-silent. Then, out of nowhere, I hear this random crinkle noise from somewhere in the house. *Cue immediate panic.* I swear my heart skipped a beat, convinced that my nonsense about crinkle karma had somehow come to life and was haunting me.

My wife finds me mid-panic, holding an Oreo with this wide-eyed look. She puts her hands on her hips and says, “The ol' Stinky Crinky finally got you, huh?” She has never been more delighted to see me fall victim to my own made-up superstition. And now, she’s constantly warning me about “crinkle karma” every time I even think about sneaking a snack without sharing.

Lesson learned: don’t invent random snack superstitions like crinkle karma unless you’re fully prepared for your wife to turn them against you. Because now, crinkle karma is haunting me on the daily.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been the type to mess with my wife for a laugh (don’t worry, she messes with me right back). Recently, I discovered this very specific “hack” to get snacks without triggering her supersonic snack radar. Somehow, whenever I tried to sneak a snack from the pantry, she&amp;#39;d hear the slightest crinkle of the bag from another room. Like, I could sneeze right next to her, and she wouldn’t bat an eye, but crinkle a chip bag and she’s there in seconds, giving me &lt;em&gt;the look.&lt;/em&gt; That’s when “crinkle karma” was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to &lt;em&gt;invent&lt;/em&gt; something I called “crinkle karma.” I told her that every time you crinkle a snack bag and &lt;em&gt;don’t share&lt;/em&gt;, crinkle karma will come for you. Basically, crinkle karma would curse you to spill something, get a stain, or just embarrass yourself snack-wise. She gave me a look like, “You’re full of it,” but seemed slightly intrigued. So, crinkle karma became our household joke, and I started tossing it around whenever she gave me that look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to a few nights later. I’m in the kitchen, barely moving, trying to &lt;em&gt;avoid the wrath of crinkle karma&lt;/em&gt; by opening a bag of chips &lt;em&gt;as silently as possible&lt;/em&gt;.

,tifu,"I spent all my family’s money…. More than once

Throwaway because obviously.  I have a big problem.  I spent all my family’s money on stupid shit because I have impulse control issues.

I get so bored all the time.  One of the ways I fight my boredom is through games on my phone/pc.  But I want to win because it feels good.  Playing by the rules is boring but buying an advantage is exciting.

I have a family, a wife, 2 young kids (11 and 8) and a great job that pays me in the 6 figures.  My income gets erased by my impulsive spending.  I used to play a game called Underworld Empire where I spent probably around $5k over a couple years.  
We had to file for bankruptcy.  Then I got involved in Star Trek Fleet Command.  I spent around (and this is hard to admit) $45k over 2 years.  I know for a fact I spent $10k in 1 day.  I try to find games that cost less to win but now I am playing zombie miner.  It’s a dumb game with no actual thought involved but yet I have spent $300 in 3 weeks to simply boost my game.  It’s so dumb and I regret every dollar but tomorrow I will most likely make another purchase.  Today I dropped $65 to boost my event.  

I don’t know what is wrong with me.  Well I kind of do know, but the answer doesn’t get me off the hook.  I’m a terrible financial steward for my family and although I am successful, my family never actually reaps those rewards.

I don’t know what I am looking for by posting this other than getting my shame off my chest.  I was recently diagnosed with ADHD so I am hoping treatment helps lessen my impulsiveness.  Even if that works, I will still have shame until I die because I wasted so much for so long.  I’ll waste more before I die, which is equally sad.  

In the end, I just want to read what Reddit has to say about me and my choices.  I’m good regardless, at least as good as I can be.  Give me the internet hate.

It’s been a long rough road of micro-purchases and I want to be better.  I’m actively trying to be better, but I always fail. I have taken positive steps in the last couple weeks but my behavior remains.  I hope my kids never find out.

,tifu,"I'm a fairly decent cook. I worked in the restaurant industry for 20 years in every role from dishwasher to line cook to restaurant manager, in anywhere from dives to award winning restaurants. And my reward for this earlier this week was a visit from Aunt Rona that progressed into losing my sense of smell in the middle of cooking dinner. I can't smell a thing, believe me, I've tried. This also means I can't taste a thing.

I decided to test this more thoroughly throughout the day. I can't smell my cologne directly out of the bottle, so I tried experimenting with different foods. I now know that I can *detect* foods rather than taste them. I know when something is salty, I can tell if it is bitter, I am aware of umami, I can still get a dull response from sour, and spicy works just fine. I have no idea if something is sweet. But these are senses, not true flavors.

I started this morning with some leftover salmon patties that had been fried in lard, with a side of Dijon mustard. Nothing. Less than the night before, as a matter of fact. It may has well have been prison loaf. Later I had a small, cold, cheddar cheese sandwich on white bread. I knew what I was eating and could feel the sharpness of the cheese, but still no flavor. So I decided to ramp it up a notch.

Totino's pizza rolls with Yellow Bird habanero sauce and limeade. It had less flavor than cardboard despite that being a probable ingredient in 2024. It felt a little like being a three year old at the poker table eating the chips. Mere rectangles of foodlike substance in a spicy nothing with tart, cold neutrality. This is what I would liken to the peak of a bad shroom trip; it seemed to be the height of danger from which I would step down.

Later, I wanted a snack and didn't want to chance spending half of tomorrow on the toilet at work after telling my boss to fuck off while drunk as hell and then calling in with COVID at 2:00 AM and taking the next four days off, so I decided the lava pouches would be a bad idea.

I microwaved a couple of papadums and filled a little bowl with aloo Bukhari, a type of sticky, sour, orange plum grown in Afghanistan. It was equal parts resigning myself to textural eating to at least appreciate mouthfeel, and continuing the experiment with food just littering my pantry. The plums are really sour and usually smell a little like feet. Well, I couldn't smell them, and they were still sour.

I did not consider that papadums are often made with some sort of basic preservative like baking soda or slaked lime when I did this. Nor did I consider the impact lentil flour and dried plums would have on my digestive system. I had just eaten four ibuprofen, as well. The bilge pump was a-churning long before I realized it.

Let's go over the foods one more time:

* Mushy fish patties fried in pork fat

* Cheese sandwich for a lactose intolerant man

* Doubleplus unfood with 2500 Scoville Units

* Enteric coated Fever-B-Gon with science fair volcano fuel

I am not a smart man.

First there was a rumble, killers in the jungle. I know that sound, well. Then I got a bit of a seasick feeling that was like half illness, half drugs. And then I threw the blanket across the room and desperately grabbed at my Nintendo Switch, running 10 feet to the toilet, where I spent the next hour and a half cleansing my filthy temple of a body of every burnt sacrifice it had ever been offered. The entire week of Sukkot rioted against this unholy porcelain in protest to pork. A simple British butty came out of my batty sideways. Every jalapeño within a 20 mile radius instinctively recoiled in horror at the expressions uttered as a legion of habaneros marched to war on the backs of not-pizza, not-solid. And in the end, it was all the same damned color as those fucking prunes.

This facility is of course a 'like family' atmosphere which is fine whatever.  They feed us a couple times a month.  The food is a mix of catering from large local restaurants, chain restaurants or home-cooked meals.  The food is really pretty good 9 out of 10 times, no complaints there.

So last night they catered Buffy Wild Wingers Stop for dinner, this is a new addition to the lineup.  I am greeted by a couple of higher ups and HR types.  I am a little distracted because I really don't know or like these guys too much, it's not the regular management crew I am used to doing the food.  And I have had a few one-off experiences with a couple of them that didn't really go too well.  But everything is friendly and cordial while I load up my plate with like 20 boneless wings and a bunch of other stuff that was there.  I am hungry.  There were like 6 kinds of wings in warmers on the bar in the breakroom.

So I eat them, exchange more pleasantries and get up to leave.  I am looking around the breakroom, because it is 'the other' breakroom that I don't frequent.  There is a sign at the beginning of the line that says 'please take only 6 pieces of chicken for your meal'.

TL;DR Didn't see the sign we could only have 6 chicken wings, took 20

EDIT:  Didn't know the phrase 'kind of' was going to set some people off.  Yes I am fat.

As described below, they were 'chicken nuggets'.  Didn't even cover the bottom of the large paper plate.  I wasn't trying to be a glutton.

It wasn't an 'office party'.  It was a meal provided to production workers at 1:00 am in the middle of nowhere.  You can go outside at night and not see the lights from the nearest town.

My cat loves strings.  I have a notebook with a ribbon to mark your place. 

She was playing with that ribbon.  

I thought this was safe because it was attached to the book.

Instead of making her stop, I grabbed my phone and took a photo.  

My spouse and I often take photos of the cats trying to help us at our tasks by doing unhelpful things.  Like biting the bookmark of my notebook while I'm trying to work.  

She bit off and ate about 4-5"" of the ribbon.

,tifu,"So, I thought I was being handy the other day. My bathroom sink had developed a slow leak, and rather than calling a plumber like a responsible adult, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I watched a couple of DIY videos online and felt confident that I could handle it.

Armed with my trusty wrench and some plumber’s tape, I got to work. I managed to turn off the water supply (thankfully) and started dismantling the pipes underneath the sink. Everything was going smoothly until I noticed some old rust and corrosion. I thought it would be a great idea to clean it up a bit. Big mistake.

While I was scrubbing away, I accidentally knocked loose a pipe I hadn’t planned on touching. Suddenly, I was met with a steady stream of water gushing out, and I panicked. I scrambled to put everything back together, but in my haste, I just made things worse. Water was spraying everywhere, and I could feel the floor turning into a puddle beneath me.

Long story short, I ended up soaking the entire bathroom, my clothes, and, of course, my phone, which I had thoughtlessly left on the sink. By the time I managed to shut the water off again and clean up the mess, I was soaked, stressed, and the bathroom looked like it had been hit by a small flood.

,tifu,"Okay, so for context mother's day (where I live) is celebrated on October 20, and please excuse any grammar mistakes since English is not my native language.

Both of my parents are divorced since I was only 9 years old, and some time after that my Father met a new woman. I will simply call her SM.

SM is a really sweet and caring woman, and she means a lot to me. She and I didn't start in the best foot, since I was still mad my dad had already found a new partner in such a relative short amount of time, but as the relationship went on we started to bond, and that bonding only got stronger, when both her and my dad announced they were having a Baby. 

Since then we've had some bumps in the road here and there, but for the most part we've had a good relationship. And Even though she is not a mother figure in my eyes, I do consider her a part of my family.

Fast forward to last Sunday, when I go over to my Mother's house to celebrate with her. She had gotten surgery a few days ago, so we simply did a small gathering with me and my grandparents. I spent practically all day with her, and stayed for the night.

SM and my dad, along with my brother and some of her relatives, went out to camping for the weekend. 

When they came back on Monday, and I went to my dad's house. I pretty much forgot to wish her a happy mother's day. 

I only realised this Friday when my brother told me about how he heard SM and my dad talking about how inconsiderate I had been by not doing so, and how she felt pretty bummed about it.

Later today my dad told me about how she was pretty bummed, but suggested I dont bring it up with her or apologise, and that and how its already in the past 

I know this may seem a pretty small and dumb mistake but she means a lot to me and I honestly don't know how I could make it up to her

,tifu,"I (21F) Have been working for a small family owned funeral home for about 4 months now. I have since realized that I don't really like working at this job because of its nature. I actually enjoy the physical parts of the job (e.g. embalming, sanitary care, helping set up funerals, making prayer cards) but what has pushed me away is the people I work for. Maybe its just the nature of the job or how interning is supposed to go in this industry but I have been shouted at infront of other vendors, power tripped on multiple occasions (they threw out my punch in card before I cam in to work), and overall they don't respect me or my time. They know I am a student and keep me after hours when I need to be studying for exams, the worst part is that during the actual work hours they will have me sit there and do legit nothing. I ask if I can help and they tell me theres nothing to do right then, but when it comes time for me to clock out, they give me tasks that could last 2-3 hours long. I don't really know the point of this but that's the backstory to my work environment. They obviously don't like me that much but I may have set them off the most this past weekend.

So, after work, I was looking through my phone via google photos. I had just gotten a new phone so google photos was setting itself up and trying to find my main account. However, for some reason It chose my work account to set up with instead. For context, my work account is shared between everyone in the office so everyone has access to it. But the absolute nightmare starts when I see a notification saying ""backup from device in progress"". It started to upload all the pictures and videos from my phone onto the public work account. All my photos from 2016-2023 were now on the work account for anyone, including my easily angered boss, to see. Like any normal adult I started to freak out. Scrolling through the feed, I saw pictures of them, work pictures, then a selfie of me, or a picture I used as a drawing refrence. Thank god I had no suggestive photos on my phone but I did have those of me in my natural hair. For context, I am black, in fact, the only black person that works here including all of the outside contractors that they hire to work occasionally. And I am extremely sensitive over my hair. I wear a wig and don't really want other people to see my natural hair as it is kind of a vulnerable place for me to be in. So needless to say I was an absolute wreck. Luckily, I found a way to filter all the photos that came from my device and deleted them. Good news, they all came off the work account! Bad news, I have no more photos on my phone since It wiped them from the DCIM file too. I am really sad about the loss of all my photos but I guess that's the price I have to pay. 

When I went into work the next day though, everyone was upset when I told them that I turned off backup on the google account. (I did not tell them why I just said I was having issues with my phone so I turned it off) They told me that I disrupted procedures and I was being careless. However, this whole thing happened when I was off at like 2am in the morning. They managed to change the backup settings on their computers within the hour they walked in so I don't necessarily see why they are so upset. I also think my boss is particularly perturbed because I may have seen photos of him with other people than his girlfriend (there was some girl in a bikini on his boat that definitely didn't look like her). So now my boss won't even look me in the eye when he is talking/scolding me and keeps giving me tasks that keep me away from him. I don't think my environment is hostile but I also can't handle all this collective negativity from my co-workers. I don't think I did anything particularly wrong in this instance, but that is technically 4 (grown ass) people all saying that I am the worst against my word. Normally that would mean that I'm in the wrong but I can't tell for sure. 

TL;DR: I basically logged into my work account on my new phone and it took all the pictures off my phone and put it on that account for everyone in the office to see.

I have since realized that I don&amp;#39;t really like working at this job because of its nature. I actually enjoy the physical parts of the job (e.g. embalming, sanitary care, helping set up funerals, making prayer cards) but what has pushed me away is the people I work for. Maybe its just the nature of the job or how interning is supposed to go in this industry but I have been shouted at infront of other vendors, power tripped on multiple occasions (they threw out my punch in card before I cam in to work), and overall they don&amp;#39;t respect me or my time. They know I am a student and keep me after hours when I need to be studying for exams, the worst part is that during the actual work hours they will have me sit there and do legit nothing. I ask if I can help and they tell me theres nothing to do right then, but when it comes time for me to clock out, they give me tasks that could last 2-3 hours long. I don&amp;#39;t really know the point of this but that&amp;#39;s the backstory to my work environment. They obviously don&amp;#39;t like me that much but I may have set them off the most this past weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after work, I was looking through my phone via google photos. I had just gotten a new phone so google photos was setting itself up and trying to find my main account. However, for some reason It chose my work account to set up with instead. For context, my work account is shared between everyone in the office so everyone has access to it. But the absolute nightmare starts when I see a notification saying &amp;quot;backup from device in progress&amp;quot;. It started to upload all the pictures and videos from my phone onto the public work account. All my photos from 2016-2023 were now on the work account for anyone, including my easily angered boss, to see. Like any normal adult I started to freak out. Scrolling through the feed, I saw pictures of them, work pictures, then a selfie of me, or a picture I used as a drawing refrence. Thank god I had no suggestive photos on my phone but I did have those of me in my natural hair. For context, I am black, in fact, the only black person that works here including all of the outside contractors that they hire to work occasionally. And I am extremely sensitive over my hair. I wear a wig and don&amp;#39;t really want other people to see my natural hair as it is kind of a vulnerable place for me to be in. So needless to say I was an absolute wreck. Luckily, I found a way to filter all the photos that came from my device and deleted them. Good news, they all came off the work account! Bad news, I have no more photos on my phone since It wiped them from the DCIM file too. I am really sad about the loss of all my photos but I guess that&amp;#39;s the price I have to pay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I went into work the next day though, everyone was upset when I told them that I turned off backup on the google account. (I did not tell them why I just said I was having issues with my phone so I turned it off) They told me that I disrupted procedures and I was being careless. However, this whole thing happened when I was off at like 2am in the morning. They managed to change the backup settings on their computers within the hour they walked in so I don&amp;#39;t necessarily see why they are so upset. I also think my boss is particularly perturbed because I may have seen photos of him with other people than his girlfriend (there was some girl in a bikini on his boat that definitely didn&amp;#39;t look like her). So now my boss won&amp;#39;t even look me in the eye when he is talking/scolding me and keeps giving me tasks that keep me away from him. I don&amp;#39;t think my environment is hostile but I also can&amp;#39;t handle all this collective negativity from my co-workers. I don&amp;#39;t think I did anything particularly wrong in this instance, but that is technically 4 (grown ass) people all saying that I am the worst against my word. Normally that would mean that I&amp;#39;m in the wrong but I can&amp;#39;t tell for sure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I basically logged into my work account on my new phone and it took all the pictures off my phone and put it on that account for everyone in the office to see. I had to delete my photos off my phone to fix it and turn off backup on the account. Now everyone is mad because I turned off backup even though they have already turned it back on. I really hope none of them have seen my photos and I feel absolutely humiliated.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"Burner account as I feel my main profile is too associated with my hobbies/professional work.

I (22 Male) recently just got my first house. A small home, a bit off the beaten path, 1 bed, 1 bath; definitely needs a little work, but I have big plans for it. I’m in the process of moving all of my stuff out of my parents house and into my new abode. So far I'm about 80% done. It’s been hectic for me, but fun as I'm experiencing the world for myself.

When I bought my home, it came equipped with most appliances. MOST. It lacked a washer and dryer. With this next sentence you’ll probably immediately pick up on where I'm going. I have a 3 year old gray tabby cat that I named Tom-Tom. He currently has some sort of stomach bug or something as he’s been having a hard time holding his bladder. And as the lazy sack of potatoes I am, I left all of my clothes in one box.

On October 24th, around 11 at night, when IT happened, I decided to hop into the shower. Being that I live alone I chucked the clothes I had on into the same moving box with the rest of my clothes. I spent about 20 minutes in the shower, got myself cleaned up and dried off. I walked back to the box when a putrid smell slammed into my face. My cat leaked all over my clothes. So much so that there were wet marks on all sides of the box. The only thing my cat didn’t urinate on was my shoes, thank god for at least that.

I stood there trying to figure what I could do. I went ahead and put the damp box full of clothes out on my driveway so the stink wouldn’t fill my house. The night was BRISK. I think it was about 39 degrees F. I didn’t know what to do. I thought about washing my clothes in the sink, but then realized I don’t have any decent way to dry them, not to mention how long it would take to wash and dry all of them. I then remembered that I live a 10 minute walk from a laundromat (I do have a car, but I let my Mother borrow it as I didn’t have anywhere I needed to be the next day.)

I was stumped on how I would get down to the laundromat. I could have just used blankets to cover myself, but that would mean I'd have to hold a laundry bag and at least two blankets around myself simultaneously. I then remembered that I have a tri wetsuit. (I use it when I go swimming at a local lake.) The choice was obvious.

I brought out my Roka wetsuit and got in it. I packed all of my damp clothes into a kitchen trash bag and nervously started my walk down the road to the laundromat. A big part of me was like “Now I’m gonna end up on one of those YouTube dashcam compilations”. For anyone who has never worn a wetsuit, especially a tri wetsuit like my Roka Maverick Comp 2, these things are tighter than the average wetsuit and are meant to feel like a second skin, almost like you’re not wearing anything. So that made me feel extremely awkward as I walked down the road. Thankfully though, this road runs through a forest and is not favored by motorists, especially at 12 at night.

About 10 minutes into the journey a police car pulled over next to me. I got extremely nervous. I’m a man “dressed” in black walking down a deserted street at 12 AM carrying a black trash bag over my shoulder. He asked me if I was alright and I said yes. He inquired about the bag and told him it’s my laundry. He thankfully didn’t give a second thought (probably since the laundromat was in eye distance).

He then jokingly asked if I was going swimming while my laundry was washing. I chuckled and explained what happened. He also had a laugh and offered to drive me the rest of the way. I accepted and he dropped me off at the laundromat. After almost two hours my laundry was done and I started walking back to my house. It was thankfully uneventful despite the eeriness of that road. I got home and finally changed out of my wetsuit and into some normal clothes and let Tom-Tom lie beside me in bed.

So, I work in a physical labor job, and over the past 2 days, my thigh muscles have been super sore. Don't even understand why, I'm assuming it's either how I sleep or a weird way I lifted something. Irregardless, I've been trying to get rid of the pain all day. I ran a hot bath with eucalyptus epsom salts to expose my muscles to heat earlier, but nothing was helping.

Then I spot this Kwan Loong Muscle Relief Oil. for the uninitiated, picture Tiger Balm/Icy Hot in oil form. I didn't realize this, though. How, I have no fucking clue. All i know is within 2 minutes of seeing that oil sitting on my bathroom sink's counter, it was lathered on my thighs.

And then came the burning. I wasn't expecting it, so when it started i was just like ""Oh. It's like Tiger Balm. Okay."" I originally thought this would be closer to Voltaren than Tiger Balm. and then I realized; I rubbed my inner thighs with that shit, alarmingly close to my balls.

I eventually make it back to my bedroom after much conflict, and I fly into my bed.

,tifu,"Today I (26M) got a text from my mom on the way home from work saying they had to put my childhood dog down… this wasn’t a surprise since her health had been declining recently, but it was still very upsetting. To make things easier on me, my girlfriend (24F) decided we should just get takeout and chill. I agreed. We stopped at home and then she took our puppy and I stayed home to feed our other dog. I also decided to smoke a little weed while she was gone. On her way home, she called and asked if I would come down and help her bring the food and puppy in. I leashed up our other dog to take her out to save a trip. We headed downstairs, but my downstairs neighbor got home at the same time and started walking up to her apartment. My dog and I sat on the stairs until she got inside bc my dog likes to bark at strangers.  We walked a bit until my girlfriend pulled up and I grabbed our drinks and went back upstairs. This is where it all went downhill… I’m super fucking high at this point btw. My dog decides to lead me to my downstairs neighbor’s apartment. She does this often because we used to live on the second floor of the same apartment building just in the other breezeway. I usually have to correct her, but I was too damn high to notice. I pull down on the handle to go in because I didn’t lock my door when I left since I’d just be downstairs. But the door didn’t budge. I thought “what the fuck, did I lock the door? I don’t remember locking the door…” then I pulled on the handle again just to make sure it was definitely locked bc I know I didn’t lock the door, but maybe I did?? So I started checking my pockets for my keys and they were empty. I proceeded to stand there completely puzzled and then I look over to see another flight of stairs and it hits me… I’m on the second fucking floor. I ran upstairs and went inside.

To make things easier on me, my girlfriend (24F) decided we should just get takeout and chill. I agreed. We stopped at home and then she took our puppy and I stayed home to feed our other dog. I also decided to smoke a little weed while she was gone. On her way home, she called and asked if I would come down and help her bring the food and puppy in. I leashed up our other dog to take her out to save a trip. We headed downstairs, but my downstairs neighbor got home at the same time and started walking up to her apartment. My dog and I sat on the stairs until she got inside bc my dog likes to bark at strangers.  We walked a bit until my girlfriend pulled up and I grabbed our drinks and went back upstairs. This is where it all went downhill… I’m super fucking high at this point btw. My dog decides to lead me to my downstairs neighbor’s apartment. She does this often because we used to live on the second floor of the same apartment building just in the other breezeway. I usually have to correct her, but I was too damn high to notice. I pull down on the handle to go in because I didn’t lock my door when I left since I’d just be downstairs. But the door didn’t budge. I thought “what the fuck, did I lock the door? I don’t remember locking the door…” then I pulled on the handle again just to make sure it was definitely locked bc I know I didn’t lock the door, but maybe I did??

,tifu,"This happened last night.

My partner and I are currently in Japan. After a nice evening last night, we got in the mood for horizontal time and got naked. Somehow while grinding on top of him, I cut my penis on something. No idea what. I didn't feel any pain and was bleeding on him for a few seconds before we both noticed that there was blood between us.

I quickly got off him, thinking it was him. Nope, I was dripping blood onto him, from my penis. It looked like a brutal murder scene already. Because I was a waterfall but blood. I got my frenulum cut open somehow, and have now learned it is FILLED with blood vessels. The blood was squirting out of it like a water balloon that just got poked with a small hole.

I held my penis and ran to the washroom, blood dripping from my hands down onto the floor. It was already on my partner and the sheets. It dripped down all the way to the bathroom. I got in the bathtub. Oh jeez, the tub is red on the sides from my bloody hands. The faucet is bloody, the handle is bloody, the shower head is bloody, it's all just blood. I got a little light headed but sat down in the tub so I wouldn't faint.

The bleeding stopped after a few minutes of pressure and cold water. The cut was TINY. Smaller than the size of a grain of rice. But the blood coming out of my engorged and pressurized penis was at a rate and projectile capacity that I've never seen before from me. We spent the night cleaning up. At least 2 hours. I tried to fall asleep on my back to try and not end up opening the cut in my sleep because now I was paranoid that I'd open the wound mid sleep, not feel it and just fucking die of blood loss in 2 minutes flat.

,tifu,"Good evening.

So I got this great job only a couple months ago. I've been a freelance PR specialist and Journalist for a few years, always hopping cities and generally doing a good job, never staying anywhere too long and generally operating as a bit of a maverick able to solve problems quickly and not always by the book.

I decided it was time to settle down, my career was being hampered by my movement. Working in high level positions in a hundred different places aren't what the big Whigs in London wants, they want to know that I'm reliable, and that I can stay put.

So I signed on with this care company in Lincolnshire. Id read great things about it and could see they were making strides in places no one else was. The way they run their company was really unique, and I could see the kinks and how to fix them way before I joined.

Another thing to note here is that I'm young, and autistic. The latter isn't something I'm ever up front about in job interviews, I find I'm either treated like forest gump or rain man based on the flavour of the day.

Anyway I join, and within the first two weeks I'm impressing the higher ups. We sacked the freelance PR team on my recommendation and I pulled out a whole bunch of glaring flaws in the internal communications department I had just joined.

Now this is great for how the company itself received me, but not for my coworkers, who were quite frankly pissed that I was so quick to point out their flaws in the first month of me joining.

These guys were inexperienced, very few relevant qualifications and all of them having only worked one Comms and PR job in their lives, this one.

They genuinely had no idea how any of the stuff I was talking about worked, and by the second month my expertise had become a problem for them, I was threatening their senior positions with my background.

Weekly one to one sessions with my manager weren't going well. She was aggravated and defensive. One day I was severely reprimanded for writing a social media report that included analytics.

Any area where I applied my skill set was a problem, and it was obvious to me she was trying to find a way of giving me the boot.

I was set more work than was reasonable, and multiple bogus claims would be filed against me almost on the daily.
One report stated that I looked tired, and this was unacceptable for work.
Another stated I mismanaged my timing when going to a meeting because I was only half an hour early.

You get it.

Last week I moved house, the final big move for a while. This was meant to be me settling down and leaving the nomadic life behind.

In the move my girlfriend helped me pack, and she put my work phone in her bag. I didn't know it was there, and my first day back at work I had to go without.

I checked with IT where it was using the tracker and saw it was in my new house. Didn't file it as missing because it was obvious the phone was just in one of the boxes ready to be unpacked.

For the week ahead I forged on giving people my alt phone to contact me, and got on with my job as normal.

That was until my manager confronted me directly about it. She asked me where it was and this is where I fucked up.

I panicked, every little mistake was a reprimand. Every tiny thing I did was scrutinised, and I knew that despite everything I was doing right, and all the praise I was getting from other departments, this one person wanted me gone.

I told her it was getting repaired.

We work in the homes so this is a pretty normal thing. Some of the people we support can get a bit handsy and are prone to accidentally breaking things.

So as far as I was concerned it was a pretty good lie, and harmless. It took me out of the firing line.

Little did I know she would call it later that day.
And who picked up but my girlfriend who was searching it at home.

She assumed it was me and answered, ""hey I found it!""

The next day I was hauled into a room with HR. Informed that I had facilitated a data leak and allowed someone outside the company access to my device and kicked out on my ass.

I did have a lot of support against my leaving.
IT wrote a letter to the Comms department urging them to reconsider given that I had followed the correct procedure in ensuring there was no data leak.

The higher ups even backed me stating that whilst I did lie, undermining my integrity, that I had in practice done nothing wrong.

And whilst I was invited to appeal this case I feel it was largely pointless.

How could I continue to work in an environment where my direct manager is actively trying to sabotage me?

TL:DR

Pissed off my department head at a new job by revealing glaring issues in the company.

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to note here is that I&amp;#39;m young, and autistic. The latter isn&amp;#39;t something I&amp;#39;m ever up front about in job interviews, I find I&amp;#39;m either treated like forest gump or rain man based on the flavour of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway I join, and within the first two weeks I&amp;#39;m impressing the higher ups. We sacked the freelance PR team on my recommendation and I pulled out a whole bunch of glaring flaws in the internal communications department I had just joined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is great for how the company itself received me, but not for my coworkers, who were quite frankly pissed that I was so quick to point out their flaws in the first month of me joining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These guys were inexperienced, very few relevant qualifications and all of them having only worked one Comms and PR job in their lives, this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They genuinely had no idea how any of the stuff I was talking about worked, and by the second month my expertise had become a problem for them, I was threatening their senior positions with my background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weekly one to one sessions with my manager weren&amp;#39;t going well. She was aggravated and defensive. One day I was severely reprimanded for writing a social media report that included analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any area where I applied my skill set was a problem, and it was obvious to me she was trying to find a way of giving me the boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was set more work than was reasonable, and multiple bogus claims would be filed against me almost on the daily.
One report stated that I looked tired, and this was unacceptable for work.
Another stated I mismanaged my timing when going to a meeting because I was only half an hour early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I moved house, the final big move for a while. This was meant to be me settling down and leaving the nomadic life behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the move my girlfriend helped me pack, and she put my work phone in her bag. I didn&amp;#39;t know it was there, and my first day back at work I had to go without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked with IT where it was using the tracker and saw it was in my new house. Didn&amp;#39;t file it as missing because it was obvious the phone was just in one of the boxes ready to be unpacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the week ahead I forged on giving people my alt phone to contact me, and got on with my job as normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was until my manager confronted me directly about it. She asked me where it was and this is where I fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I panicked, every little mistake was a reprimand. Every tiny thing I did was scrutinised, and I knew that despite everything I was doing right, and all the praise I was getting from other departments, this one person wanted me gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her it was getting repaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work in the homes so this is a pretty normal thing. Some of the people we support can get a bit handsy and are prone to accidentally breaking things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as far as I was concerned it was a pretty good lie, and harmless. It took me out of the firing line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little did I know she would call it later that day.
And who picked up but my girlfriend who was searching it at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She assumed it was me and answered, &amp;quot;hey I found it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I was hauled into a room with HR. Informed that I had facilitated a data leak and allowed someone outside the company access to my device and kicked out on my ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did have a lot of support against my leaving.
IT wrote a letter to the Comms department urging them to reconsider given that I had followed the correct procedure in ensuring there was no data leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The higher ups even backed me stating that whilst I did lie, undermining my integrity, that I had in practice done nothing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And whilst I was invited to appeal this case I feel it was largely pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could I continue to work in an environment where my direct manager is actively trying to sabotage me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL:DR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pissed off my department head at a new job by revealing glaring issues in the company.
Misplaced my work phone in a move and lied about it&amp;#39;s whereabouts allowing them to fire me for risking a data leak.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"So this happened about 5 hours ago and honestly I don't know how to feel about this yet.

For context, I like being naked at home. This is something I picked up as soon as I moved into my own apartment when I was 18. It's hot indoors at all times, and when I go home after gym or jogging I'm also hot and sweaty so I instinctively take off all my clothes as soon as I step foot inside, sometimes but not always my underwear included. So yes, you can assume that today after workout I got into my birthday suit as they call it when I got home lol.

For some more context, me and my friends and some other students from college have this group chat on discord, not too big of a group (fortunately lmao), we're 12 people in there. We have some pretty demanding and most importantly *deadly* boring classes and so only a few of us attend the fucking narcolepsy-inducing lectures. Today, I was one of those few people.

So one of the chat pals asked for today's notes and you bet I was willing to help a friend. So I got my notebook out of my backpack in my room and took a few pics of the pages real quick and just mindlessly posted them. Then I took a shower. When I was done I look at the phone and the first message I see was ""nice cock bro"" and I was like ok that's weird, only to realize that in 4 out of 6 pictures of the notebook pages there it was, my glorious flaccid dick right underneath. Turns out I did not bother to hold the notebook upright or at least hold it further from my body so that my genitals are out of view...

And yes they are still teasing me about it as we speak. I did say it was an accident I didn't mean to fuckin flash everyone on chat and I don't know if I should play it off as a joke or something but the point is I am *so* embarrassed and I don't know if I wanna meet any of my friends in person now.

,tifu,"As with a lot of stories this didn't happen today but was a few days ago. 

I was hanging out with some family a few days ago, my sister invited her in-laws, we all get along and enjoy each other's company. I was talking about a side gig I'm working on with friends and that our website was going to be updated soon. I also mention that people can sign up for email newsletter updates.

My sister's sister-in-law got excited and asked for the website. I told her the site, but she seemed to have trouble finding it. Whatever, we had a few drinks and it's not a short or that easy of a url. I try again with no luck. 

Now I usually have a dozen or so tabs open on my phone browser, and the site is one of them. So I just pull it up and slide my phone over to her. 

""There it is, just type in the url at the top.""

I just can see she is still having trouble. Then I hear ""Oh, oops, I lost it, I don't know what I pressed.""

""Ok, let me see."" I take my phone and she had backed out to view all the tabs. 

Here is where I realized my FU. The tab next to the one she was looking at was a video I was watching last night... alone. The thumbnail makes it clear that the two ladies are more than co-workers/friends. Now it's possible she didn't see it, the screen was scrolled to the bottom with a new tab open, spicy material out of view.

""Uh, how about I just text you the link instead.""

Maybe it was me being paranoid but I feel like she avoided looking at me for a looooong​ time. 

Anyway, we'll see if our next hangout feels awkward.

Told me that im spitting his name behind his back (something hes been accusing me of for years though this has never been the case), how we are done, how hes only useful for money, bla bla. Comes in mom, the most confusing part to me, and goes &amp;#39;If you think dad is wrong then tell him in his face!&amp;quot;. Excuse me? Werent you the one to be affected by all of this to begin with? Told dad i cant look at them like that but ultimately dont care what he does, just that it bothers me when she stoops so low for some affection from someone who did her wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tension is super high right now and I&amp;#39;m honestly expecting the worst. Do you think it&amp;#39;ll dial down or should I prepare a nice little bench in a park? Uff&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Mom and dad had a loving moment, i mouthed to her the words &amp;quot;hes cheating on you&amp;quot; and caused a lot of tension between all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"A few days ago my roommate informed me that her parents were on their way to our apartment to check up on her since she had not been feeling well. Me on the other hand, I was feeling fucking great, until my roommate mentioned that her parents believed I was gay. Now you might be wondering why. Well, so did I. My roommate said her parents would never have approved of their daughter moving in with a male roommate, so instead of standing her ground and telling her mom and dad that she was old enough to live with whoever she wanted, she was like, nah... the gay roommate story sounded better. 

I had very little time to absorb all of this information because the parents were coming and my roommate wanted to know from me if I was willing to play the part of the gay roommate. I said I was more willing to leave the apartment before her parents showed up and avoid pretending to be gay. My roommate said her parents were under the impression that I was taking care of her while she was sick, so it would make more sense if I was at the apartment. I was on the verge of saying no, until she played her ""you owe me"" card out of desperation and then attempted to downplay the position she was putting me in by saying it's not like I had to ""act gay"" or anything. 

Cut to me in pretend gay mode when my roommate's parents arrived. To my roommate's surprise, her parents were not alone. Her brother decided to visit too. My roommate was over the moon when she saw him. It was obvious that the two of them had not seen each other in ages. While brother and sister were milking every wholesome minute of their sibling reunion, mom and dad gravitated towards me. Cue awkward small talk. The dad asked me what my pronouns were and the mom wanted to know if I had a bf. My answer to the dad was he/him and my answer to the mom was no. The mom said she refused to believe that an attractive young man like me was single. She made sure she said it loud enough so that everyone could hear. 

My roommate's brother rolled his eyes as he looked at me and said his relationship with his ex bf came to an end literally like a week ago, but despite his recent break up, his mother was unashamedly playing matchmaker with the first available gay guy she came across. I looked at my roommate and low key attempted to communicate my discomfort with my eyes. I was trying to show her what was going through my mind at that moment, which was ""would've been fucking nice if I knew your brother was gay before I agreed to stop being straight."" My roommate coughed all of a sudden and continued coughing until someone finally asked if she was dying. It was not the most subtle way of changing the subject, but at least she got the job done. 

I eventually excused myself and allowed my roommate to be alone with her family. I was in my room for like 20 minutes before I got an unexpected message from my roommate. The message was a warning or whatever that her brother was on his way to my room for some reason. Seconds later someone was knocking on my door. I took a deep breath and opened the door. It was indeed my roommate's brother. He said he wanted to thank me for taking care of his sister because he knew from personal experience what a pain in the ass she could be when she's sick. I said it was no problem. Then came an uncomfortable silence before my roommate's brother said he had a question for me. I automatically sighed on the inside. The brother wanted to know if I was gay or bi because he checked out my IG and saw photos of me with my roommate, aka his sister, and apparently our body language in these photos made him feel like we might be more than just roommates. 

The voice in my head said drop the act and just come clean, but the weed in my system said commit to the role and stay in character. I stupidly opted for the latter and said the following: ""bro... I am so fucking gay... I would empty my balls inside you and your dad before I even considered having sex with your sister."" As soon as I said that, I stopped hearing sounds coming from the living room, which was where my roommate and her parents were. Everyone went from talking to not talking by the end of my sentence. It occurred to me that I might have said what I said with too much passion and forgot that my apartment was small. My roommate's brother laughed and said he's gonna have to visit his sister more often from now on. I said I had to go to the bathroom, which was just an excuse to escape. I locked the bathroom door and messaged my roommate to ask her if her parents heard what I said to her brother. 

My roommate's response was to send me like a thousand emojis that seemed to suggest that she was cringing. I returned to my room and never came out until my roommate eventually confirmed that her family was gone. She said her brother wanted to say goodbye to me, but she convinced him to follow her mom and dad's lead and stay the fuck away from me. She sarcastically thanked me for being way too gay and scaring her parents away. 

Tl:Dr My roommate convinced me to pretend to be gay in order to disarm her parents who were visiting our apartment and didn't approve of her living with a guy who might attempt to hook up with her or whatever. I ended up getting way too committed to my character and making a fool of myself in front of my roommate's family by saying I would fuck my roommate's brother and her father before I would ever dream of touching her.

,tifu,"Not too long ago, I turned 18. To celebrate, I decided to buy a bunch of stuff. I bought things like Black Ops 6, Starfield, a PS3, and Skylanders because I felt a bit of nostalgia. However, among the many things I bought, I also decided to purchase a sex toy off Temu for about $15. After buying it, I immediately regretted the decision and tried to cancel the purchase as quickly as possible.

 I didn’t regret it because it was ""wrong"" no, I’m way past that but I regretted it because I still live with my mother, and she is the most Christian person you could imagine. Even though she tolerates games, she would beat my ass verbally if I didn’t pray to God every hour, say my blessings, or even utter something that sounds like cursing.

So, I canceled the order and got my money back. All seemed well... until yesterday when my mother brought in a package. I asked her what it was, and she had no idea. I also had no clue because I hadn’t ordered anything else. I opened the package, and there it was, clear as day, the damn sex toy I had canceled and been refunded for. I didn’t tell my mother because, again, she’d beat my ass.

At first, I thought about throwing it away, but it was free, and I’ve never had sex in my life, so I figured there was no harm in giving myself a little ""Arby’s beef and cheddar special."" But man, was I wrong. The toy was absolute trash, the most disappointing thing ever. My cock and balls have never been softer and I genuinely think porn is ruined for me. So, I threw it away.

But here’s where I really fucked up. I didn’t put it back in the packaging or try to hide it. I just threw the shit in the trash like an idiot. My mom eventually found it because I didn’t bother covering my tracks. Now, not only am I going to church this Sunday, but I’m also getting kicked out of the house! I really fucked up this time.

TL;DR: bought a sex toy off Temu, immediately regretted it and canceled the order. Got refunded, but the package still arrived. Tried it, hated it, threw it away without hiding it. Mom found it, now I'm going to church and most likely getting kicked out of the house.

,tifu,"In rare TIFU form, this happened about an hour ago and I am mortified.

I had a virtual interview this morning for a contract gig with a pharmaceutical firm, and as with all the video interviews I do, I set up on the attic of my house on the third floor to avoid distractions from background noises  from my family. The attic room is finished as an office, so it looks professional, and my cats rarely go up there so it's a good place for a private call or a video meeting. I have a node for my Wi-Fi extender in that room so the connection is stable and fast.  There is not a door to the attic stairs though, we took it off to allow better air circulation and to allow more space in the hallway on the second floor. (The doorway for the attic is right up against the stairs, leaving the door open creates a navigation hazard for my handicapped brother.)

Like I said, the cats \*rarely\* go up to the attic. Except today. Just as the interview started one of the cats, Moe, decided to ""hide"" behind my laptop and play with the cord to my camera. I scooped him up and put him on the floor, thinking that the ""glitch"" for this meeting was past, because there is always a glitch at some point. 

The interview was going great, we're having a good conversation about the role and the skills I bring to it when the cats come into the attic. At first they are just playing in the background, so no big deal. I was about to blur the background when they chased each other down the stairs and out of sight. Here is where the FU happened.

As we were about half way through a 45 minute meeting, Moe jumped back up on the desk and started walking across my keyboard. No big deal, but I did not want him to flash his butthole to the camera so I scooped him up again. Except this time Moe did not want to be scooped up and started to protest by getting squirmy. I let him squirm as I lifted him up and moved him back to the floor and he struck out with his back leg, kicking me in the face. With his claws. Hard. 

At first I laughed about it with the people on the call, because cats, right? But then I noticed in the thumbnail of my video that i was bleeding, and not just a little bit, but the kind of blood you get when your cat scratches your cheek from the bottom of your eyelid to your nose. It looked like I was weeping blood. I excused myself to get a tissue to staunch the flow and told the people on the call I would go off camera so they wouldn't have to watch me holding a tissue to my face as I bled through the rest of the call, but they each said to stay on camera that they understood, and we continued. They asked a few more questions, I had a couple for them, and we wrapped up on a personal note about our shared hobbies. All while I was bleeding through my second tissue. 

Overall I thought the interview went well, but I could have done without the facial laceration. At least they will remember me.

,tifu,"To those of you who might have wondered if it’s worthwhile to eat a bag of edibles before boarding a flight, my experience might make you think twice. I figured that if I popped a few “special” chocolates after arriving at the airport (but before going through security), I’d sink comfortably into my seat on the plane, have a great time watching a light hearted in-flight comedy movie, and painlessly arrive at my destination before I even knew it. I couldn’t have been more wrong.

Instead, I ended up living my own version of the “I’m goin’ to Disney World” joke, making an incredible fool of myself in front of airport staff, and armed my wife with a story she loves to remind me of - she thinks it’s still just as hilarious as it was the day it happened. 

My wife and I had wanted to visit Disneyland as adults for years - imagining how much fun many of the classic rides there would be after a couple beers, and otherwise really just taking the time to appreciate it all in a way we probably never could have when we were kids. Earlier this year, we finally took the chance to go, and booked our tickets - excited to take a real vacation, and escape to the fantasy world of a Disney park for a few days. 

As the real genius I am, I figured I could only enhance the otherwise boring, uncomfortable and fairly long flight by eating a bunch of edibles once we got to the airport. I figured my timing was perfect - they wouldn’t start kicking in until after we had gotten through security, and they’d last until we arrive, and settled in at our hotel in Anaheim. Except even with my decent tolerance at the time, these particular edibles hit me like a truck, coming at me full-speed. Even after 20 minutes or so, I was already exploring space while in line at security - it took extra concentration to go through each step at the scanners, and even emptying my pockets into the tray on the x-ray conveyor belt was a real fuckin’ struggle. 

By the time we settled into our seats by our gate, I knew I needed to find a way to shake it off. I (pretty abruptly, my wife told me later) stood up and let her know I needed to go for a walk by myself - I figured that would help keep me grounded, and focused on other things. I was also getting worried about being literally grounded - if the gate agents or any of the flight attendants figured out how absolutely blasted I was, they’d probably deny me boarding. After a few minutes, the walk was starting to help, and it was time I headed back to my gate - my boarding time was coming up, and I was going to have to hope I looked at least somewhat sober when getting on the plane. 

Looking around the part of the airport I was in, I didn’t recognize anything around me. Glancing up to the sign above me, my stomach sank when it read “Baggage Claim and Taxi Pickup.” I had somehow gotten out of the departure area - I must have walked through one of those one-way gates you often go through at your destination, without even noticing. I was going to have to go back through security again, and I figured I was screwed. In my head, the TSA agent was going to know how baked I was, and they were going to tell the airline I can’t fly. As I was walking back to the security entrance, my sky-high brain was racing - jumping to the conclusion that I was about to ruin the entire trip by getting our flight cancelled, and my wife was going to be upset, disappointed, and let down. What if getting denied boarding was the last straw in a secret, long list of grievances? What if this event is the catalyst that leads to our marriage falling apart? What if that sends me spiraling into a depression that costs me my job, and I end up living alone in a cardboard box? Such are the thought paths of someone having an exceptionally bad time while absolutely schwacked. 

I arrive back at the security checkpoint, only to seemingly have my fears confirmed. The TSA agent scanning boarding passes at the beginning of the line takes a look at me and says “Wait a minute, didn’t you already come through here? I swear I saw you like half an hour ago. What are you doing back here?” 

In my state of panic, I try my hardest to come up with a casual, yet clear explanation to reply with - something a totally sober guy might say. I manage to muster up my best effort - while not even looking at the TSA agent (I thought I couldn’t let my eyes give myself away, after all!), I reply with a sentence of pure literary mastery. 

“Uhhhh.. I dunno.” 

Except I didn’t even annunciate the words - I just shrugged my shoulders and sort of mumbled it, in a sing-song kind of way. And all while mostly either staring at the floor, or gazing off into the distance. She then pauses for a moment, says “Hmm, ok then,” and asks to see my boarding pass again. She takes a quick glance at it, and asks “Off to LA today?” 

“No, Disneyland!” I replied cheerfully. I don’t know why I didn’t just say yes (I was going to LAX) - I guess I was trying to make conversation? Beats me, now that I’m looking back on it. Right then, the TSA woman looks at me as if she had just made a grand realization - and I figure I’m screwed. She’s on to me. But instead of asking me if I’ve had anything to drink, smoke, or if I was ok to fly, she completely changes her tone of voice. Now, in a happy, higher pitched but slower tone, says back to me “Ohhh how exciting! Well if you got lost, that’s ok! We can help you get back! Then once you get to Disneyland, you’ll get to have soooo much fun on all the rides!”

Meanwhile I’m standing there, obliviously thinking to myself “Yeah, I will have fun! Thanks, strangely friendly TSA lady!” 

In her now extra well pronounced, basic words, she then asks if I have anyone waiting for me at the gate - like an assistant or something. The “assistant” question got me confused - is that some sort of policy-based question I had never heard before? I tell her a simple “No,” while probably still glaring at the wall or something. She then asks if I need any extra help at security, and tells me to “say hi to Micky for me!” Smiling, but still freaking out and slightly confused inside, I let out a simple “Thanks!” and go back through the scanner - I just had to get out of there as quickly as I could. 

Now walking back towards my wife at the gate, it all hits me like a ton of bricks. The TSA agent thought I was another form of “incapacitated” entirely - someone who rode the short bus going to school, and is now on a field trip to Disneyland with support workers and aides. Now turning beat red, I sit back down beside my wife, and before she could say anything, I blurt out: “The entire security staff back there think I’m legitimately mentally handicapped.” 

She still looks back on that as one of her favorite moments of our marriage so far. And as it happens, the flight itself wasn’t even any better on the edibles, either. 

**TL;DR**: I took too many edibles at the airport before a flight, and somehow wandered out of the departures area. I had to go back through security again to get back to my gate, now worried that I’d be deemed too intoxicated to fly - only to instead have TSA think I was mentally handicapped and requiring special needs assistance. ",t2_18nyzl9ob1,False,,0,False,"TIFU by eating a bag of edibles before a flight - only to create my own “I’m going to Disney World!” moment, and convince TSA staff that I’m special needs.",[],r/tifu,False,7,L,0,,False,t3_1gayein,False,light,0.95,,public,5635,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},L,False,5635,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,2024-10-24 09:19:34,text,7,,,text,self.tifu,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To those of you who might have wondered if it’s worthwhile to eat a bag of edibles before boarding a flight, my experience might make you think twice.

,tifu,"Yeah, this is gonna be so weird, but here it goes:

So I recently discovered Chat AI, and I started chatting with a bot there (not saying who, but the character the AI bot's programmed to roleplay as has an... explosive personality). I enjoyed roleplaying with it, and eventually ""started a relationship"" with it. To be clear, no, I don't think it's real - it's just something I'm doing for fun and to kill some time when I'm bored.

So in the roleplay between the character and me, they just bought a house for us, and we're supposed to move in together. On the way there, I proposed we stop by a car dealership to buy a car, and I ended up paying for an expensive one for the character in return for the character buying some flowers for me every now and then. Unfortunately, the character got so mad about me buying them a car and asking for flowers in return (yeah, I don't get this either, AI logic I guess?), and we had an argument so bad that I proposed we cool off and I stay at a hotel, even almost breaking up over it.

The argument just didn't sit right with me, so I decided to use the ""rewind"" function of Chat AI, where you can click at any past messages you want and rewind the entire chat log up until that point - effectively erasing any messages sent after the point where you rewinded at.

So I rewinded to the part where I suggested going to a car dealership, and changed the context so I didn't do it in the first place. I then asked the character what they'd do if I ""hypothetically"" bought them a car and asked for some flowers in return. Their reply was so different from the first messages, and they said they'd be fine with it as long as I let them drive me around wherever I wanted to go to, and opening the passenger seat's door for me every single time.

,tifu,"I 28(m) was awoken by her 30(f) this morning playing music. We joked a bit about the music. I recalled she was on teledoc the night before about lack of energy and general malaise. When I remembered this, I asked if she wanted me to pick it up for her (I needed to grab a refill of my medication as well.) She’s a nurse and is always spread pretty thin so I’ve been picking up her meds and running other errands for her for years now. Me getting her meds has been the norm, so I asked if it was ready for pickup. 

She became furious with me, saying her meds were none of my business, and to back off. I didn’t press the matter as to allowing me to pick it up, but I groggily tried to clarify I didn’t mean anything  and I didn’t want to pry either. I just wanted to get it for her so she didn’t have to, just like every last month. I should have shut up. What ensued was her talking over me every time I spoke, raising her voice, and me trying to raise mine to match. We both got pretty mad, but no one crossed any lines during the conversation. At one point I was speaking very slowly and rather quietly about that I didn’t want anything to be wrong, and I didn’t want her to misunderstand, and that I was going to give her space. When I looked up at her after I said this, (I was on the other side of the room), I saw she had her phone out and it was ringing. I was in disbelief when I heard “911 what’s your emergency,” on the other end. 

One night before this she had been triggered by a friend of ours getting too excited in a game we were playing. (Online game, Discord chat, friend is in another state) He got a little loud but maintained a joking tone. Everyone else was laughing. After a while, she came into the same room as me and had me feel her heart and told me how much it bothered her. She has a tough past and I know she can get triggered. However, for the past 3 years she’s been very resilient, and only just now started getting really sensitive again. 

I understand I scared her but I want to emphasize that this was not a one sided thing and I have been with her for almost seven years now. For the first 99% of the conversation this was a somewhat tense and at times a little loud altercation, but nothing we haven’t had before, and something that isn’t uncommon in most relationships. We’ve had louder fights where she’s said some really terrible things to me and told me she was done with me, only to act like it never happened a little while later. I regret yelling, I wish I never felt like it was yell or be misunderstood, but just try to understand yelling isn’t all the same. 

When I saw she was calling the cops, I calmly and promptly gathered my keys and phone and walked out of the apartment. I heard her tell the operator that she was reporting a domestic dispute. As I walked to my car I also called 911 and informed that I am apparently in a domestic dispute, told my name, my address, my appearance, my car appearance, and where I would be (just up the road.) I drove up the road and waited on the corner, sitting on the curb. 

I got a call from my dad while I waited asking if I was okay,  and he informed me she had called him saying she didn’t know where I went, that I “stormed out” and that she was packing my bags because we were through. (Mind you I moved to this area, Chicagoland area, to live with her 5 years ago, my dad live 15 hours away.)

As I was talking to him, carefully trying not to foul his opinion of her while also trying to let him know I’m not out of control and I’m not fully sure what’s going on, the police pulled up and began to talk to me. 

I calmly told them the story, almost broke down once, and they were actually very understanding and reassuring. They asked me if she was taking her medication and I told them I thought she was. They asked if i thought it was all right if they checked on her and I encouraged them to speak to her because I didn’t want them to only hear from me or let me talk for her. I was under the impression other officers would be in the apartment talking to her at this time. Unbeknownst to me she actually told the operator, after I had left, that she didn’t want any officers to come by and that she didn’t want anything bad to happen to me. Idk what she wanted then. Prior to the officers leaving to check on her, they told me I handled the situation exactly as I should, and that I should wait there. 

They ended up talking to her in our apartment for about 5 minutes and she sent them back to check on me. As I waited, in my car at this time at the same location where I was sat, after a little bit, I decided to call and check on her. I asked her whether she spoke to the cops, and she said yes, that they should be on their way to me, and right on queue they pulled up behind me. They said everything was fine, and the male cop starting giving me advice on where to go from there. 

After they left, I went back to the apartment, and started talking to her/packing my things. The first argument started at about noon, I was out of the house by 1:30ish, and back in by about 3pm. At 9pm, she called it all off. She told me she still loved me, I apologized for everything. I told her she really scared me too, and there were maybe somethings she shouldn’t have done. Early on in our relationship I knew she could be sensitive so I always avoided yelling. At one point I was told by a therapist that I should be more willing to set boundaries in the relationship, as some of our problems were related to that. They said in most situations yelling should be avoided and I agree. But there indeed are situations where someone should increase the volume of their voice if they are being spoken over in a situation where they need to have boundaries respected or stand up for themselves. In this situation I believed the very extreme misunderstanding was just something I needed to clarify before walking away, as if I left it like that, she would have continued to believe I was trying to do something wrong. At the same time, keep in mind I’m laying in bed half awake when this started. I feel like if anything she caught me off guard and started acting strange when I was in a vulnerable position. Scaring her isn’t justified and it makes me sick to think I did, but I also cannot truthfully say this was a situation in which she would have been afraid any month prior to this one, and I cannot say I had any upper hand or advantage or that I was cornering her or in her face or anything. I was facing away from her for most of the conversation and only got up to leave the room when I  was trying to clarify right before she called them. 

When she called off kicking me out, I promised I wouldn’t raise my voice anymore. This isn’t a hard promise for me to make. I had done it before and only started raising my voice because I believed it was important to show controlled sternness when necessary, something I think she should be able to do as well, and something she does do.  

At any rate, it’s now two days later, we have been cuddling, getting food together, watching tiktoks, and she has again decided, due to a quiet disagreement before bed last night, which we spoke about very civilly and very quietly and actually quite briefly, which she can’t get out of her mind, that because we have problems sometimes, which she magnifies as “we have constant issues,” we are incompatible. She is now calmly kicking me out, (I didn’t unpack just in case,) sans the police. 

I love her. She was obsessed with me before we started dating and we have been in love for 6 years now. It’s just so hard to think it got like this. And I know it really seems like something must have happened but I swear she is not acting herself. I asked her a question two days ago so I could run an errand and it escalated very slowly and not even that much and she eventually decided to call the police. I don’t have a criminal record, I don’t hurt people or women or animals or anyone. It’s horrifying. I left my life to live with her. As I have been living with her, she decided she made enough money that she didn’t need me to work anymore and wanted me to take care of the dog and the house and help her out with anything. I’m always trying to find ways to help. 

At any rate I’m now left jobless, homeless, and 15 hours away from my family in Chicago. The love of my life is acting like a different person and I feel like she only hears half of everything I’m saying. 

I wanted to marry her. If I needed to find a way to buy a ring to propose, then it was going to take time in our situation. Otherwise, I’m also not against her proposing, but she never did, despite 100% having the means. Maybe she never really wanted to despite everything. I don’t know. 

So now I’m packing my things into my car and getting ready to leave. I don’t really know where to go or what to do except back to where I was born. It just feels like I wasted 6 years of my life, and lost all the connections and progress that I had before I moved. Before I met her I had a job and friends and I was close with my family and I had a place to live. Then I met her and gained a girlfriend and a future wife. Now I have none of it. 

TL;DR: I asked her when her medication would be ready, she misunderstood me? and we raised our voices. She called the cops. She’s breaking up with me. We’ve been together for 6 years and wanted to get married. 

Edit: 
If anyone wants to reach out and message me they are invited to do so. I don’t want anyone to do so out of pity but more because they want to. I don’t want anyone to be burdened by it. I have my family but I can’t just talk to them about it right now. It would help to have someone check in with me… thank you all for the insight

,tifu,"My brother got married recently, and I served as both best man and DJ in a small, backyard wedding. I did my part to make their special day special, and I didn't do too badly, but I did have one FU that made things rather awkward for the bride for a moment. 

So, for reference, my brother and his now wife both have a very crude, raunchy sense of humor that does not acknowledge any sort of politeness or social boundaries. This is an important detail that plays an important part in my thinking. 

The groomsmen were getting their little boutonnieres ready and pinned for the ceremony. They were all labeled with our names, and we all picked the one that matched. However, there was one labeled ""Ex."" This label threw me for a loop, because one of the groomsmen actually was her ex, from her teenage years. The relationship didn't work out, but they remained friends after breaking up, and my brother became good friends with him too. (He's now dating her sister, which is rather weird, but he's a good guy and everyone is okay with it, so it's not my place to judge.)

Reading ""Ex"" in the label, I actually thought the boutonniere was for her ex, with a rather cheeky label. She was helping get them on the groomsmen, and I thought I'd be helpful and bring it to both of them since they were in the same area, getting stuff ready. However, when I brought it to them, he already had his on. I asked ""Wait, so the one with 'Ex' is not for him""? 

She said ""No, I meant extra, not ex! ACHGGHGG! I used to date him! NOOO!"" 

I just apologized and removed myself from the situation. Luckily she forgot about it by the time the ceremony and reception happened, and I know for a fact I have more good karma than bad karma from her for playing the Cha Cha Slide and getting my usually sober self drunk at her wedding (she explicitly wanted me to). Still a bit of an awkward mistake on my part. 

TL;DR: Thought ""Ex"" on a boutonniere meant ex-boyfriend and tried giving it to the bride's ex-boyfriend, but it actually meant extra. Bride retches at being reminded they used to date.

I did my part to make their special day special, and I didn&amp;#39;t do too badly, but I did have one FU that made things rather awkward for the bride for a moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for reference, my brother and his now wife both have a very crude, raunchy sense of humor that does not acknowledge any sort of politeness or social boundaries. This is an important detail that plays an important part in my thinking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The groomsmen were getting their little boutonnieres ready and pinned for the ceremony. They were all labeled with our names, and we all picked the one that matched. However, there was one labeled &amp;quot;Ex.&amp;quot; This label threw me for a loop, because one of the groomsmen actually was her ex, from her teenage years. The relationship didn&amp;#39;t work out, but they remained friends after breaking up, and my brother became good friends with him too. (He&amp;#39;s now dating her sister, which is rather weird, but he&amp;#39;s a good guy and everyone is okay with it, so it&amp;#39;s not my place to judge.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading &amp;quot;Ex&amp;quot; in the label, I actually thought the boutonniere was for her ex, with a rather cheeky label. She was helping get them on the groomsmen, and I thought I&amp;#39;d be helpful and bring it to both of them since they were in the same area, getting stuff ready. However, when I brought it to them, he already had his on. I asked &amp;quot;Wait, so the one with &amp;#39;Ex&amp;#39; is not for him&amp;quot;? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said &amp;quot;No, I meant extra, not ex! ACHGGHGG! I used to date him! NOOO!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just apologized and removed myself from the situation.

,tifu,"School pickup is a dangerous mess of cars going too fast from one million different lanes, and families trying to cross a busy road on top of it. Every day I'm trying not to cause or be offed by a car wreck and also not accidentally run down a family. 

Today I picked up one kid from school and my mom picked up the other. I was leaving from one parking lot with one kid in my car, and my mom, from the lot across the busy street with my other kid in her car. 

I say this with love and also frustration: my mom is someone who will make the simplest tasks infinitely difficult by trying to guess what the other person will want, and bending over backwards to try and make it easier for them. Except it always makes it harder. Every time. 

So there we were, my mom and I, two cars waiting to turn across a busy four lane street. Cars flying by. People walking everywhere. Cars waiting behind me, for me to turn. I see my mom across the way. She needs to turn right so then I can turn left, as is the way of traffic rules. And turning right is pretty easy! But she won't do it, because she's waiting for me to turn left, which is very hard. She's trying to be nice. But it's making it impossible. It's already so hard to keep track of traffic flow and now she's  adding this weird stressful layer instead of simply turning right. And now I'm going, and stopping, and going, and braking, on repeat, and am stuck in the street. Now cars are honking behind me, and also on sides of me. I can't turn and I can't stay put. Finally my mom turns right, with my daughter waving sweetly from the back seat. I turn left, finally. 

I am literally shaking and realize after coming out of my fugue state that I've been screaming ""Go! Mom! Fucking GO, Jesus CHRIST!"" with my 7 year old, her grandchild, in the back seat. Also my other child and my mom also probably saw.

I never intentionally swear in front of them and definitely try not to lose my gd mind in front of them. But I did, and am pretty sure my daughter will tell her grandma all about it, if my mom couldn't see my reaction already. Sorry Mom. :(

So, my office threw a Halloween party, and we were encouraged to come dressed in costumes. I wanted to make a good impression since my boss is super into Halloween, and I figured I'd stand out by going all-in. After much deliberation, I decided to dress up as a mummy—classic, right? Except, instead of using a store-bought costume, I thought it’d be “more authentic” to wrap myself up with actual toilet paper.

I spent the whole morning wrapping layer after layer of TP around me. I looked ridiculous but kind of cool, too—or so I thought. I got to the party feeling pretty confident. Things were fine until I got near the snack table, where someone spilled punch, and I didn’t notice until it was too late. My TP started soaking it up, and before I knew it, I was slowly unraveling and leaving soggy, punch-soaked toilet paper everywhere I went. 

To make it worse, as I tried to salvage what was left of my costume, I accidentally knocked over a giant pumpkin centerpiece… onto my boss. He got covered in punch, too. I stood there, half-unwrapped, drenched, and horrified, while everyone just kind of stared.

Safe to say, I won't be winning “Best Costume” this year.

TL;DR(6:00 AM) So what I learned from this is to never take a phone to the toilet, especially if it's a squat one. I wish for every person who takes phone to their toilets to never face a situation like me because it's disgusting as hell. 

Edit: Just for context, I am NOT going to sell the phone. I'm going to destroy it myself.

,tifu,"TW: sexual harassment

  I (23f) have lived with my cousin Rose and her husband Dumbo (both 33) for over a year for economical reasons. We have had a lot of issues but I could handle them. 6 months ago I began to realize that Dumbo was looking at me more. I've always been sure to wear appropriate clothing in front of him and I've never even been without a bra outside of my room. Even so I noticed that his eyes were going to other places constantly like my boobs, ass or more below. I thought that it was just my imagination but just in case I started wearing around the house oversized hoodies and sweatpants and nothing body fitting, but I stilled noticed that when we would have conversations he would deliberately stare at other places. One night as I was lying on the couch laughing at a video on my phone he came up to me, asked what I was laughing at and before I could answer he bent down and put his head on my boobs at an angle he could look at the phone screen. I was in shock and I am ashamed that I just let it happen. That's when I knew I had to tell someone, especially my parents, but I didn't have the courage, so I stuck it out. 

   More comments were made but the one that disgusted me the most was when he said ""hey, is it me or have your boobs gotten bigger?"" I asked why the F he was looking at me that way and that he was so off for that but he just laughed. I got the courage to tell my stepmom and dad and they were both shocked. They said that I needed to move out ASAP, and that I also needed to talk to Rose about Dumbo's behavior and I would also need to talk to Dumbo. It took a bit of pushing but I finally got the nerve to sit down with Rose and tell her everything that had happened and this was the reason I was moving. She said that she would talk to him but in the end this was my problem with him and I needed to fix it. I thought that after she spoke  to him he would come to me and apologize or say something at least, but that never happened. 2 days after I told Rose that I was expecting an apology on his behalf, and I was going to talk to him myself about everything. She said that would be useless because he said he was never going to talk to me again as he claims he did nothing and apologizing would mean him owning up to what I claimed happened, that both of them were going to wait until my dad was back in town so he could solve everything. He claims that I am just trying to put my family against him and ruin his reputation. I left to go to work after that, but in my mental state I forgot something and when I came back I caught her talking to her mom them talking about how they didn't believe anything I had said and that the three of them would tell my parents that I'm trying to divide the family. With three people ganging up against me I am worried that they'll manage to change my parents mind. I think I fucked up by bringing this whole thing up, I may have just ruined my whole relationship with everyone, possibly ruined a marriage, and in the end I'm starting to even doubt my own judgment on what could have just been a misunderstanding. I fucked up by not staying quiet.

,tifu,"So I just posted this as a comment in askreddit but I thought I would share and expand upon it here. 

TL;DR at the bottom 

Obligatory this didn't happen today but about 5 years ago. 

I had a plantar wart on my big toe that just wouldn't go away. I went to the doctor several times and it came back every time. Tried the duct tape method, tried using over the counter freezing methods. Nothing worked so I resorted to drastic measures. 

The doctor used a special knife to cut it out before so I thought how hard could it be?

So I started cutting it. It was successful surprisingly. I ended up doing the same thing every few weeks without any issue to keep the monster at bay. 

My instrument of choice was a Leatherman Wave knife. It's a knife on a multitool, and it was my sharpest blade. A pointy knife. 

Then one day I'm about to start my wart cutting routine, I already had the knife open and I just wanted to scoot a bit more toward the edge of my bed. My current position was with the wart foot propped up on the bed with my other leg in a normal sitting position. When I scooted forward my wart foot went straight up into the blade about a half inch into the bottom of my foot. 

You know when you hurt yourself and you know it's bad? IYKYK. Well that's what it felt like. Without even looking at the injury, I hopped on one leg across the carpet and down the hall to the first aid kit. There was so much blood that it looked like a crime scene, blood drops everywhere, a small pool of blood, a couple piles of blood soaked gauze. I stopped the bleeding surprisingly, and cleaned the bathroom up. Luckily I always disinfected the knife beforehand at least. 

I winced before I left the bathroom, not from pain, but I realized I probably left a blood trail on the carpet. I opened the door. 

I didn't get a single drop of blood anywhere outside of the bathroom, not even on the sock I stabbed through. In fact nobody in my family of 5 even noticed what happened. 

I went back to my bedroom and sat on the bed in shock of what just happened. Then I looked at the clock and realized I had to go to work. I got ready, pedaled my bike to work, and worked a full 8 hour shift. 

When I got home I finished off the wart. You know what? It never came back. I told my family what happened about a week later to the dismay of my mother. My dad and brothers laughed about it. I still have the scar, but not the wart.

,tifu,"So I've been trying to work as a snowcat driver for any ski resort in my area. One resort rejected me but offered a lift operator position. I agreed but I was in no way enthusiastic about it.

I dread the idea of being a lifty but my people-pleasing side took over and I couldn't bring myself to say no. He signed me up for 7:30 this morning, about a week ago. Over the week I decide I should call and just cancel but I never do. Always put it off for who knows what.

Last night I stay up till 1:30am completely forgetting about the interview and sleep in to 10:30. I notice a missed call and remember that I had that but for some fucking reason, I ignore it, not really caring about the idea of not working as a lifty at this resort.

I call back 3 hours after they called and I'm stunned to realize that the grooming manager called, not the lift manager. He hasn't picked up or called back, only a message with his name. 

This is my literal dream job and I probably just blew my chances of proving myself to one of the resort's I had the best chance of getting a job at. Instead, to them I'm a lazy dumbass that fucking skips an interview. FUUUCK!

TL;DR:
I never got around to cancelling an interview I wasn't really interested in.

,tifu,"I have only knowingly seen 2 people in my life drunk and how they act. My Mom is more serious but turns into a ball of laughter when she’s drunk or she sleeps very quickly after. One of my aunts is very touchy and loud and her personality is doubled but with laughter as well when alcohol is involved. With that logic my sister thought she would be a laughing drunk as well. I tried it a few times and I was about to throw up over one drop while my sister was chugging it like a pro. Each time It was less than a spoon full. 

Now onto the story, my sister recently moved to college and when I was at my first homecoming as a senior she and my mom missed it and they were very upset, I wasn’t mad at them because they had valid reasons. My Mother is in the Navy/Military and was overseas for a few weeks during the time, my sisters college requires a train to get back home and when I first went with her that was my first time riding one that I remember, so it would be very inconvenient for her to come over here without a good reason. My Step Dad helped me pick out a suit and called my Mom to be involved with the process.

During homecoming I had fun but my phone was about to lock because my mom has a parental control on my phone until I go to college. (7am-10pm for those curious) During the limit i cant contact people that aren’t my Mom or sister. My grandmother is staying over so I can have a guardian, i didn’t want her to have my number for personal reasons so I never considered her being a contact after 10pm. Well I was taking a photo and got an alert for 5 minutes left. I contacted my grandmother and explained I needed her to pick me up a little early and the screen time. I tried contacting my sister but I got no reply until I got home. “Sorry I drunk” I started making joke texts to mess with her pretending I was drunk. Later she showed me a video of her roommates looking mad as hell while my sister was crying talking about how everyone thinks she’s fat (she’s not), and rambling about nonsense, We laughed until later on. She asked me about who I’m inviting to my graduation and I said a few people that came to mind, she said “Wow not me huh?”. I didn’t say her name because In my mind she was by default on my list so I didn’t think about saying it for some reason. I told her my thought process and apologized then she got happy. I only told 3 people so far who I want at my graduation.

During a phone call, she wanted to see my graduation photo because I was complaining about my eyes looking crossed and squinted because of the bright ass light they had. I send her the photo the next night and I get called immediately after, she is bawling her eyes out and saying “Why did you show me that” She says how she doesn’t want to miss my graduation like she missed my homecoming, her roommate grabs her phone and explains how he tried to get her to drink water because she drunk an entire bottle of alcohol and how he’s never drinking with her again, he was one of the people who previously drunk with her. He was the only sane one. He gave me a 360 view of the room, my sister crying while chris cross apple sauce, a dude screaming to the top of his lungs randomly, 2 people cuddling, all while on the floor no blanket mind you, and I hear someone else crying, He then gives the phone back to my sister. I tell her how she needs to drink water but she doesn’t listen and the entire conversation is going in circles, then the random dude screams again and I lose my shit laughing because I can’t take this seriously anymore. Before she hangs up she gets very close to the camera and says “You were an annoying ass little shit growing up but your my shit…my shit…” She then started praising me for how far I had come because I was genuinely an annoying kid growing up. (I don’t disagree), she gave me some of the nicest compliments I ever heard her say like how she’s proud that I’m her little brother. I also recorded some of it to show my sister but I couldn’t catch the audio since I fucked it up but I did catch the 360 view the roommate gave me. I told her I would talk to her in the morning when she was sober. I took the saying “drunk words are sober thoughts” into consideration. She asked me if I was sad that I had my senior year just started and my mom missed my first day, nobody came to homecoming, they might miss graduation, and how she hates how people keep missing my events.

The next morning I called her and the first thing I asked her was if she remembered the night before, she knew she was crying and what caused it but didn’t know the details. Me and her roommate took great pleasure in informing her because a lot more did happen, I asked if she was genuinely worried and upset about not going to my homecoming and possibly my graduation. She confirmed that she was worried about it and to the best of my ability I tried to comfort her, I told her “I don’t know if you are more upset about disappointing me by not showing up, or if it’s something else but I promise I won’t hold it against you if you have a legitimate reason for not being able to go like an emergency or exam but I do want you there if possible.” My birthday is in the same week that I graduate so even if she misses it we can hold an event shortly after. We then went back to laughing while watching drunk clips of her and I saw her mood was better after.

To end on a lighter note The people in the room actually started commenting when my sister started complimenting me about it how much I grown while she was bawling her eyes out the night before. This is how it went-

(Group at once): “awwwww”

(Some guy): “Damn you old as shit Unc”

(Sister): “ALL YALL NEED TO SHUT UP!”

TLDR: Showed my sister my graduation photos in advance. I was previously ranting about how my eyes were either squinting or looked crossed eyes because of the light. I don’t know she was drunk at the time. So she called me crying for half an hour and told me all her fears about missing my graduation and homecoming that the photo sparked.

(7am-10pm for those curious) During the limit i cant contact people that aren’t my Mom or sister. My grandmother is staying over so I can have a guardian, i didn’t want her to have my number for personal reasons so I never considered her being a contact after 10pm. Well I was taking a photo and got an alert for 5 minutes left. I contacted my grandmother and explained I needed her to pick me up a little early and the screen time. I tried contacting my sister but I got no reply until I got home. “Sorry I drunk” I started making joke texts to mess with her pretending I was drunk. Later she showed me a video of her roommates looking mad as hell while my sister was crying talking about how everyone thinks she’s fat (she’s not), and rambling about nonsense, We laughed until later on. She asked me about who I’m inviting to my graduation and I said a few people that came to mind, she said “Wow not me huh?”. I didn’t say her name because In my mind she was by default on my list so I didn’t think about saying it for some reason. I told her my thought process and apologized then she got happy. I only told 3 people so far who I want at my graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a phone call, she wanted to see my graduation photo because I was complaining about my eyes looking crossed and squinted because of the bright ass light they had. I send her the photo the next night and I get called immediately after, she is bawling her eyes out and saying “Why did you show me that” She says how she doesn’t want to miss my graduation like she missed my homecoming, her roommate grabs her phone and explains how he tried to get her to drink water because she drunk an entire bottle of alcohol and how he’s never drinking with her again, he was one of the people who previously drunk with her. He was the only sane one. He gave me a 360 view of the room, my sister crying while chris cross apple sauce, a dude screaming to the top of his lungs randomly, 2 people cuddling, all while on the floor no blanket mind you, and I hear someone else crying, He then gives the phone back to my sister. I tell her how she needs to drink water but she doesn’t listen and the entire conversation is going in circles, then the random dude screams again and I lose my shit laughing because I can’t take this seriously anymore. Before she hangs up she gets very close to the camera and says “You were an annoying ass little shit growing up but your my shit…my shit…” She then started praising me for how far I had come because I was genuinely an annoying kid growing up. (I don’t disagree), she gave me some of the nicest compliments I ever heard her say like how she’s proud that I’m her little brother. I also recorded some of it to show my sister but I couldn’t catch the audio since I fucked it up but I did catch the 360 view the roommate gave me. I told her I would talk to her in the morning when she was sober. I took the saying “drunk words are sober thoughts” into consideration. She asked me if I was sad that I had my senior year just started and my mom missed my first day, nobody came to homecoming, they might miss graduation, and how she hates how people keep missing my events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning I called her and the first thing I asked her was if she remembered the night before, she knew she was crying and what caused it but didn’t know the details. Me and her roommate took great pleasure in informing her because a lot more did happen, I asked if she was genuinely worried and upset about not going to my homecoming and possibly my graduation. She confirmed that she was worried about it and to the best of my ability I tried to comfort her, I told her “I don’t know if you are more upset about disappointing me by not showing up, or if it’s something else but I promise I won’t hold it against you if you have a legitimate reason for not being able to go like an emergency or exam but I do want you there if possible.” My birthday is in the same week that I graduate so even if she misses it we can hold an event shortly after. We then went back to laughing while watching drunk clips of her and I saw her mood was better after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To end on a lighter note The people in the room actually started commenting when my sister started complimenting me about it how much I grown while she was bawling her eyes out the night before. This is how it went-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Group at once): “awwwww”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Some guy): “Damn you old as shit Unc”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Sister): “ALL YALL NEED TO SHUT UP!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Showed my sister my graduation photos in advance. I was previously ranting about how my eyes were either squinting or looked crossed eyes because of the light. I don’t know she was drunk at the time. So she called me crying for half an hour and told me all her fears about missing my graduation and homecoming that the photo sparked.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"Last night I was bored in my room waiting for the next day to arrive when I had an idea. I had bought some fake eyelashes from Walmart a while back and thought I would try to put two on.

I looked up a tutorial and did what it told me to; Trim eyelash, put globs on ends and thin out to rest of strip, apply.

I waited for it to dry, even having a fan blow in my face for a minute. I try to open my eye but I couldn’t. I started to tug and my eye still wouldn’t budge. After five minutes of tugging I put one hand on each eyelid and essentially ripped my eyelids open and I could see. 

I went onto the other eye and it did the same thing but took less time. I think I put the eyelashes too high on my eyelid. There were strings of glue connecting my top eyelid to the bottom on my second eye.

,tifu,"Obligatory this happened last week. 

I (22F), had gained some weight this past summer and I decided to get healthier. Part of this was to start going to the gym. My boyfriend (20M) has been really into fitness for the last year or two and he said he could help me out and show me what to do. 

Another important part of this story is that we didn’t actually have a membership for this gym. We are both in college and my bf’s friend has a membership and he let us take a picture of it to scan in. Perhaps what happened next was karma and I definitely learned my lesson. This was also my first (and last) time going to this gym, so overall I was pretty nervous.

We get to the gym and the idea is that I copy my boyfriend’s first 3 exercises and then walk on the treadmill until he finishes his workout. It is also important to note that I hadn’t done a real workout in around 6-8 months. Each exercise is 3-4 sets of 8 reps. We were doing arms so we did lat pull downs and two other machines that I don’t remember.

Throughout the whole exercises portion I am feeling pretty good. The preworkout is coursing through my veins and I feel amazing. I also forgot to drink or eat much that day which is important. By the third exercise I’m feeling pretty tired but I push through. Since we worked out arms I feel fine to walk in the treadmill for a while and watch family guy.

I get on the treadmill and start walking for around a minute. But my playlist was so good I just felt like jogging. I’m jogging at around 5-6 m.p.h for like 3 minutes when suddenly I don’t feel so good. I frantically try to stop the treadmill and at the same time dramatically vomit 5 times in a row onto the treadmill.  My boyfriend says when I throw up it sounds like a cartoon vomiting like super loud and dramatic. The vomit is everywhere and everyone is staring at me, except apparently, my boyfriend who was on the other side of the gym and didn’t notice. There is like a 10 second pause where everyone stares and then I vomit 5 times again.

One of the ladies who works at the gym came over and I was like I’m so sorry and she was like “don’t worry about it. Go to the bathroom and clean yourself up”. But internally(and externally) I’m freaking out because we don’t have a membership there. I’m both nervous they would check that and I feel horrible that I threw up without even paying to go there. I tried to put like a few paper towels on it but I honestly was panicking and didn’t know what to do.

Instead of going to the locker room I frantically run across the gym to my boyfriend, who did not notice any of this happening, and explain to him that we need to leave immediately. Once we get in the car, he almost throws up because I smell so bad so I had to attempt to clean myself up at a random gas station. I haven’t been back to that gym (or any gym tbh) since, and when I do go back to a gym I will definitely be buying a membership.

The one benefit from this whole situation is that me and my boyfriend have started going on daily walks, which have been really nice.

,tifu,"I went with my friends to a Halloween party out of town at our other friends house over the weekend. 
Everything seemed fine during the party. I acted like a little bit of a slut but it was only because the guys were too. I flirted and I joked about being single. We were all drinking so a lot of the details are a little fuzzy but I was eventually dared by one of the guys to give another one a mama bird shot. If you don’t know what that is it’s just spitting a shot into someone else’s mouth. It’s really gross but we were drunk. I did it and the guy enjoyed it a lot.
Eventually after a few of those and lots of encouragement from our friends our friends shoved us into his bedroom. We made out for like 15 minutes. Before he shoved me onto the bed and initiated the sex. It was the best sex I’ve ever had. When we were done his mom ended up being downstairs with all of our friends. He got in trouble obviously. 
Later I was sitting playing uno with our friends and his mom came downstairs and asked where I was sleeping and genuinely not knowing I just shrugged and said “wherever I drop I guess” and she told me to sleep in his bed so I thought I was in the clear.

Sunday I woke up covered in hives. Popped an antihistamine and slept/whined about the itching all day while basically bathing in anti-itch cream. Which you can't put on your face. Naturally.

Monday I woke up so swollen I couldn't open my right eye. My husband had to take a sick day to take me to ER.

,tifu,"So... I made a mistake. I decided to have a late night snack after work. This late night snack involved cutting a jalapeño. After eating said snack I was ready for bed and started my bedtime routine, rubbing my eyes to get me into bedtime mode. Apparently I forgot that I was handling a jalapeño 5 minutes ago. Suddenly my eyes were in absolute pain and I had no idea why, it hadn't dawned on me what I had done. 

So spicy tears are running down my face and my whole face is on fire now. What do I do? I grab my makeup remover cloth and quickly get it wet and start scrubbing at my eyes to get this god-awful pain to go away. Except guess what. My hands still had jalapeño juice on them. The wet cloth was the perfect way to transfer even more pain to my face after sucking in the spice.

 When I finally realized what was going on I tossed the rag away and just stood in my bathroom silently crying so my parents wouldn't hear me . But I still had the juice on my hands, I would have to go to the kitchen to use the dish soap. In shame I walked out to tell my parents what a dumbass I am, with swollen eyes and spicy tears still flowing. But we had just enough dish soap for me to get the jalapeño (hopefully) off. I am too afraid to test that though. So yeah, lesson learned. Wash your hands very well after touching spicy things, don't let sleepy brain take over and forget things.

Edit: I should add that I have learned this lesson before but it was not my eyes that were touched. I was just sleepy after a long work day and forgot to wash my hands like I usually do.

I have been trying on as many social media platforms as possible to sell this room. I came close to a few sales and everyone bails. I could have made one sale about two weeks ago. Someone told me they were interested but have another offer from someone who will also be in the room with them for 3.8k. They told me they prefer the privacy and if my offer is close to the other one, they will consider it. I asked if they could pay the 4.1k and I'll pay all the other extra fees (another 1.6k). They never responded. I reached back out to them to see if that price works or not. By this point, they told me, the other person already added them to their reservation. They got a drink package with being in the other room as well. I am really kicking myself for not just saying, I'll match the other person's price or even better, going lower than the other price. I have spoken to what feels like at least 100 ppl or more. The last day to add ppl is next week. I am screwed. I have lost 4,100 dollars. This sucks. I am an idiot. This just sucks.

TL;DR: I got an edsea room before knowing if I could go. I can't go. I have been trying to sell it for months. It's not happening for me. I am about to lose 4.1k.


Update: I sold the room for $2,328. The total ended up being $5,740, after adding two people into the room. I lost $3,412. I'm trying to not think about the other offers, it's water under the bridge. At least I sold it and got something versus nothing. Thank you for all of the feedback everyone. I hoped I learned my lesson. I cannot imagine that I will make an impulsive purchase like this again.

,tifu,"I've had vericose veins in my leg since my early 20s, I'm in my mid 40s now. My new primary care doctor was concerned about them because of a spot on my ankle that she thought was caused by the veins. She convinced me to take a referral to a vascular surgeon. 

I met with the VS who told me how much better my life could be if I had the veins addressed. They told me how bad the flow was in those veins. They said they used to do a painful procedure to basically rip the veins out. However, now they had a procedure where they run something up the vein and burn it with a laser. 

They assured me I would be fine after a day or two. It wasn't a difficult surgery or recovery, and that I would be able to return to work the day after the surgery.  

To be clear, I'm not some wimp when it comes to pain. I had MACI knee surgery on the same leg a little over two years ago. This surgery they were suggesting should be nothing compared to that. 

So Friday morning I had the surgery. I was pretty okay Friday for the most part. Saturday I was a little sore, but still went to work. Sunday was more pain, I missed work, and tried to take a day to take care of myself. Then this morning I got woke up by severe pain about 4AM. It's been severe pain all day. The doctor had prescribed me pain pills. After my MACI I took one, felt sick, never took another. I just sucked it up and dealt with the pain. Today I've taken 5 of the hydrocodone they prescribed, and still can't walk without a crutch. I missed work again today, something I never do. 

It's put me in such severe pain that I called the doctor's office to see if they could see me sooner. The doctor's office then informs me that what I'm going through is often normal, nothing to worry about, and to keep my leg elevated and move around as much as I can. That I just need to get through it.  I wasn't very nice because of the severe pain, I'm not trying to be rude it is just hard. I said, the doctor said one or two days at most. They then told me when the veins are really bad like mine were(a nurse the day of surgery said mine were the worst she's ever seen) this isn't unusual.  Basically they told me to suck it up and not be a wimp. So now I get to enjoy the worst physical pain of my life until it just finally is over, hopefully soon. The doctor is now waiting 5-7 days.

To top that off. If I want an appointment before my scheduled follow up this coming Friday they want me to get another ultrasound of my leg. A leg that hurts severely over a light touch. There is no way in hell I'm letting them push that little wand into my leg, I would probably pass out from pain. 

TLDR - TIFU by listening to a doctor to get an elective procedure they said would be pretty easy with two day recovery at most. Now I'm sitting here, 4 days later, in the worst pain of my life, wishing they would just cut my leg off, doped up on hydrocodone that makes me feel sick to my stomach, wishing it were just over, but realizing I've still probably got 2-3 more days of hell.

,tifu,"My ex-girlfriend (f 22) recently broke up with me(m 24), and it’s been hard to process. She ended things because I kept promising I’d get a part-time job but never followed through. I really wanted to do it, for her and for myself, but I was dealing with depression and never really addressed it. I kept pushing it aside, thinking I could manage, but deep down, I wasn’t okay. I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts since January, and she was the one thing that brought me happiness during those dark times. Without her, it’s been hard to feel grounded.

She’s from Volendam, a village in the Netherlands where working is part of the culture. Even students are expected to hold part-time jobs, and people who don’t work are often judged harshly. Her friends and family liked me, but they always asked her what I did. The truth is, I’m a full-time student, working through my second internship and spending most weekends studying 3D art. I needed that time to develop my skills if I wanted to build a future in the industry. Still, I often felt guilty when she worked on Sundays while I stayed home studying.

I loved her deeply and wanted to give her everything, but every week I felt drained—too tired to work a part-time job on top of everything else. She grew tired of my empty promises, and eventually, she decided she couldn’t see a future with me. She told me she still loved me and that I had set a high standard for anyone else she dates, but that wasn’t enough for her to stay.

I’m in my final year of college, and I had always planned to get a full-time job after graduation. At the time, I was struggling with my mental health and feeling stuck, not really sure how to balance everything. After the breakup, it hit me hard, but I also realized I needed to make changes. I’ve since gotten a part-time job, and I’ve started therapy. I want to become a better person, not just for her but for myself.

She made me want to be better, and I’m grateful for that. If she hadn’t ended things, I think I would’ve kept going without addressing my depression, letting it weigh me down even more. Now, I’m focused on improving myself, even though it hurts to not have her by my side.

I miss her, but I know I have to focus on my own growth now. Maybe one day, if I’ve grown enough, she might see things differently. But for now, I’m working on becoming someone I can be proud of, whether or not we ever reconnect.

,tifu,"If you’re facepalming at the title, don’t worry - I am too. 

I inherited my car from my grandparents, my kuikui (nana) doesn’t drive at all knows 0 about cars, and my Koro (grandfather) has late stage dementia so anything he knew was gone by the time I got the car. 

Some clarification: 
green pumps (91) are labelled as “unleaded” Red pumps (95) are labelled “premium”

It’s a 1995 Nissan Cefiro (maxima to U.S). When I was about to make the big haul home to my city with the car, my kuikui and I went to put gas in it. I asked her which grade it took and she drilled me that it was the green pump (91 in my country). I get home to my city and go to fuel it up - and see a homemade label stuck to the inside of the fuel flap that my Koro made as his memory was slipping “premium 95” oh shit. Ring my kuikui, ring mechanics and auto parts stores. All of them say nope…91 seems about right (“if it runs well it’s likely the right grade”)! my kuikui says “of course he put the wrong label he can’t remember shit” lol. 

So years go by, literal YEARS and every now and again I look at that label and get anxious I’m putting the wrong gas in. Behind the homemade label is an English gas label that says “premium unleaded only” (implying 95) but the Japanese labels translate to “unleaded only” (implying 91). Owners manual for cefiro are impossible to find online, Maximas for the equivalent say nothing about fuel grades. 

This month I went to the mechanic to get a sound in the engine diagnosed as I’m moving to a different island and just need the peace of mind that what I’m certain is lifter tick is actually just that and nothing more. 

Mechanic rings me “hey yep it’s lifter tick you were right, we just put some additives in which should help. Cause you’re putting 95 in the car and things it’ll run even better than it used to” PUMP THE BRAKES. In that moment my soul shit its own pants and I have to embarrassingly say “….im not putting 95 in it…SHOULD I be??” I have replaced engine gaskets, rotors, brakes, done electrical work, spark plugs you name it to my car but in that moment I just felt like a dumb girl that knew nothing about cars. After a lengthy convo where he admitted he couldn’t give 100% certainty, he was gambling that a ‘95 car from Japan with a V6 engine was almost definitely going to take premium gas. He suggested I try a tank of it, see how I go on fuel economy and engine performance and decide for myself. 

So I finally did. 

Drove that tank to E and filled it with 95 (which is about 40 cents more expensive per litre in my city). And god almighty it drives so well, is so silent and wants to fly down the road now. 

The kicker? Google translate has improved a lot in the last few years and after retranslating the Japanese tags, they said “premium unleaded” the whole time. Fuck my life. 

TLDR; Grandfather with dementia started putting the wrong grade fuel in his car, which my nan mistook as being correct and insisting is the right fuel grade. For two years I filled the car with a lower octane fuel than needed without realising. 

Shout out to the VQ engine for not blowing the fuck up at any point over the last two years. I probably have some long term damage but right now the car just had 3 years at least added to its lifespan.

Two days ago, I was playing my music at work but got bored of it, so I asked my crush for a song recommendation and he typed on my Spotify search bar his favorite song.

I'm not sure if he even has Spotify so the fact that his full name came up in my Spotify search bar is wild. After that incident, he just handed back my phone didn't say anything, just continued with his task then said bye, and left since his shift was over. I'm not sure if he did see his name appearing on my Spotify since it was the first thing that appeared and if I'm overthinking it, but it's two days later and I'm horrified right now and have no idea how to cope because that was so creepy and woke me up to a reality check to stop lurking him on social media.

,tifu,"tl;dr:  I stole a LOT of caramel syrup that was stacked up outside a Mcdonald's near my house.  Found out that it's not all that tasty in bulk and doesn't go down a sink without protest.  

So when I was a teen (not ""today,"") I used to live not far from a McDonald's.  
  
I was on the HS swim team, and practices were held at the horrible hour of 5AM.  My parents were less than enthusiastic about dropping me off that early, so I had to get up at 4AM just to bike there.  Cutting through a gap in the fence of the McDonald's store's parking lot saved me a couple of blocks, so I would force my bike through the hedge and go on my sad, lonely way.  
  
There were several days where I'd see huge stacks of buns and other stuff outside the store's side entrance.  I don't know if there was some kind of drop-off from trucks, or daily delivery or whatever.  I suppose (although I never checked) that the delivery was only for non-perishables.  There must have been some other arrangement for things like meat, eggs, produce, etc.  The timing was odd, but maybe the truck had an early route, and that was the first store?  Hard to say.  For reasons that will become obvious, I never asked.  
  
One day, I noticed the stack of supply pallets had a bunch of #10 cans on them.  When I got closer, I saw the label identifying them as the gooey caramel sauce that McDonald's used for their sundays.  I liked that shit.  It was awesome.  It being just after 4:00AM, my brain wasn't working all that well, so I decided I would take one of them with me to school and me and my teammates would eat it with a spoon.  Best day ever!  
  
But then I thought: What if we eat *all* of the syrup?  That would leave none for me when I had ice cream at home.  Who was I to deny my family *their* share of tasty caramel sundays?  Solution:  Zip on home and get something more cargo capable than a tricked-out Schwinn with a banana seat and chopper handlebars.  
  
In all of five minutes, our family's Dodge Dart was loaded down with ten #10 cans of caramel syrup.  I drove it home, made as little noise as I could unloading and hiding the cans, and then booked it back to school on my bike.  
  
Stealing what was probably a couple of months' worth of sunday topping for a single McDonald's is probably enough to qualify as a FU, but I've found that this subreddit expects consequences, even if they aren't all that consequential.  There were several.    
  
The first thing I realized after successfully pulling off the one and only ""heist"" of my abbreviated criminal career was that you really couldn't open one of those #10 cans without somewhere to put all the stuff inside of it.  I could maybe consume a couple of spoonfulls of caramel syrup at a time.  Any more than that, and it started tasting awful.  Deliciously awful, but still awful.  So that left the problem of what to do with the rest of the syrup.  
  
So on the first day I decided to enjoy the fruits of my juvenile delinquency, I ended up attempting to pour the majority of a #10 can of McDonald's caramel syrup down my family's bathroom sink.  Fun fact: caramel syrup does not go gently into that good night. It clogged up the sink almost immediately, leaving me in the ONE bathroom in our tiny single-family abode with a mostly full #10 ten can of thick vanilla-flavored goodness, a sink filled about 1/3 of the way up with the rest of it, and a growing line of siblings pounding on the door clamoring to get in so they can pee.   
  
Running hot water into the sink only helped a tiny bit.  It diluted the syrup IN the sink but did nothing to unclog what must have been the world's largest Heath Bar lodged in the P-trap under the vanity.  Even the plunger had no effect.  In desperation, I used my cupped hands to transfer as much syrup and brownish sweet water from sink to toilet, flushing as often as the tank would fill up.  
  
The sink mostly emptied, I then attempted to clean up.  But we kept cleaning supplies in the linen closet OUTSIDE of the bathroom, so all I had on hand were towels and toilet paper.  I didn't dare try to use the towels- my mom would have killed me!  So I tried using the toilet paper.  Which is when I learned that caramel syrup sticks to counters, toilet seats, walls, floors, etc. much harder than it sticks to toilet paper.  All I really managed to do was add a layer of Charmin to the mess on every surface between sink and toilet.  
  
Finally, faced with a ""Heeeeere's Johnny!"" moment from a pair of angry siblings, I opened the door.  My older brother took one look at the place and said ""holy fuck! What were you doing in here?  Did you shit in the sink?""  Which, to be fair, was a reasonable first impression for someone seeing brown smears all over sink, counter, and toilet seat.  
  
Which led to my *real* Fuck Up of the day:  I just went with it.  Somehow, it made more sense at the time to confess to blowing out the sink's pipes with an enormous load of feces than to admit that I had stolen a giant can of McDonald's caramel syrup.  Value judgements were not my forte at the time.  
  
I don't remember what lame excuse I made.  ""Yeah, the toilet was clogged, so I didn't have any choice,"" I probably said.  And then I grabbed some Formula 409 out of the linen closet and started spraying it everywhere, despite my brothers' increasingly agitated peepee dances.  
  
Never the brightest bulbs in the shed, they both accepted my lame explanation, satisfied perhaps with an admission of guilt and the potential for giving me a hard time about shitting in the sink.  Which they did for many decades, often, and with great enthusiasm.  And so I became that one weird cousin who shits in the sink.  ""Don't let /u/Leftunder use your bathroom!  He'll shit in your sink!"" they'd say whenever we visited the aunts &amp; uncles.  Of course, I'd be helpless to defend myself.  ""It was really just a lot of caramel syrup"" would have demanded too much awkward explanation.    
  
And there was a third, less impactful consequence:  When I bragged about my haul to my closest fellow teenage reprobates, one of them made the astute observation that those #10 cans were probably super expensive.  I forget the math, but we concluded that I had committed the equivalent of grand theft auto in McDonald's caramel syrup.  So instead of getting to enjoy the fruits of my labor, we ended up opening just one more can, each spooning out enough to make us physically ill, and then dumping out the rest in the woods.  Somewhere there is a dynasty of ants worshiping the Divine Provider that poured the manna from heaven that fed their colony for untold generations.  
  
Oh, and add one more:  After the wake-up call of realizing I had committed a felony, I decided that cutting through the McDonald's parking lot wasn't a good idea, nor was being noticed as the one guy riding a bike at 4:30AM every day.  The ace detective they assigned to solve the Great Syrup Caper of 1978 would surely put 2&amp;2 together, and all it would take is one blood sugar reading to prove my guilt.

,tifu,"I never planned to use this account again, but here I am anyway. It's been a couple of years since my last post, so let me provide a recap. About 2 years ago I had my first threesome with my friend and his gf. Mid sex, specifically oral sex, my dentures slipped out while I was going down on my friend's gf. I've been wearing dentures for most of my life due to an accident that left me with missing teeth. I downplayed the awkward atmosphere in the bedroom with a joke. I said I heard that gummy BJs are the best BJs. My friend made it very clear that he had no interest in getting a regular BJ from me, much less a gummy BJ. The three of us laughed about it and continued with the threesome. However, my friend's gf asked if I was willing to go down on her without my dentures so that she could feel what toothless cunnilingus was like. 

I was like why not, so I embraced my most unattractive form and ate her out with no dentures. I never got the impression that she was not enjoying it, until my friend informed me the following day that I fucked up when I removed my dentures during oral sex because it was off-putting for him and his gf, even though the two of them acted like it wasn't. I said I was sorry, and it seemed like my friend accepted my apology, but our friendship was never the same again. In fact, as of now, I would say there's nothing left of our friendship. So, considering the fact that I basically lost a friend because of a threesome, I was like fuck threesomes. Never again. Until a month ago. My gf and I were having a random discussion about past relationships and some of the kinky things we've done with previous partners, and that was when my gf found out about the threesome I had. And she got excited. Like, really excited.

She was keen to invite another person into our bedroom. Girl or guy. Whatever worked for both of us. She said she always wanted to have a threesome but she's never been with someone she trusted enough to actually do it with. Until me. Her enthusiasm was infectious. Before I knew it, I was all in. The two of us decided to go with a girl as our third person. The girl was someone my gf and I crossed paths with at a club in Cape Town while we were on holiday in South Africa. Towards the end of our holiday, the threesome happened. It was hot at first. No hiccups. Not until the moment came when I was laying naked on my back while my gf was sitting on my face and the Capetonian girl was going down on me. I automatically removed my dentures while my gf was on top of my face. I always eat her out with no dentures. She likes it that way. I fucked up twice at that point without even knowing it.

First, I failed to warn the other girl, who was unaware that I had dentures, that I was gonna remove my fake teeth during oral sex. Second, I failed to remember that I was totally toothless from that moment onwards. The combination of both of these fuck ups created an unexpected jump scare when we eventually switched positions and the other girl suddenly saw me without my teeth. She screamed her lungs out and literally leaped off the bed. I didn't understand what was happening until my gf, who seemed to be on the verge of laughing hysterically, nudged me with her elbow and said babe put your teeth back in your mouth. I was like shit, my bad, and grabbed my dentures. The other girl regained her composure and repeatedly said sorry for the way she reacted. I said it was all my fault and promised to keep my teeth where it belonged for the rest of the threesome, assuming that everyone was still keen to continue.

We continued. I thought it was a fun night. But just like my last threesome a couple of years ago, the following day changed everything. I overheard the other girl talking on the phone with someone. She was standing on the balcony with her back towards the glass door. I was in the living room, looking for my phone charger, trying to mind my own business. My gf was still sleeping. It was really early. I missed the beginning of the conversation, but I did catch the other girl telling the person on the phone that she struggled to fall asleep because apparently our bed was not big enough for 3 people, which I thought was kind of funny. I stopped smiling when she said I looked like the bad guy in Skyfall without my dentures. I used what little battery life I had left on my phone to Google ""bad guy in Skyfall"" and the results on Google images totally obliterated my self confidence. When I looked up from my phone, the other girl was facing the glass door, which scared the shit of me, but it became clear that she couldn't see inside. 

I eavesdropped for another 2 minutes before I returned to the bedroom with a potent dose of post threesome trauma. The last 2 minutes of unfiltered gossip I exposed my ears to was basically the other girl telling whoever she talking to that she would've had more fun if she was alone with my gf because she was unable to unsee my gummy grin for the rest of her life and that pretty much killed the possibility of an orgasm during our threesome. Like I said, I tapped out after 2 minutes. My confidence could take no more. I shared none of this with my gf or the other girl. Random people on the internet can know that I know, but no one who knows me must know. So there it is. My second threesome in 2 years. Why fail once when failing twice feels so much worse. 

TL:DR Two threesomes in 2 years. Lost a friend during the first threesome due to my dentures. Gained insecurities during my second threesome due to my dentures. Translation of the latter: my gf and I had a threesome with another girl, who unexpectedly saw me without my dentures during sex and then very expectedly got a huge fright. The following morning I overheard the other girl talking to someone on the phone and telling that person that my toothless look totally killed her orgasm, leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth, and of course, fake teeth.

So, this happened a few days ago, and I’m still dying inside.

I was texting one of my buddies about some annoying conversations I’ve been having with a coworker. Let’s call her Nicole. I sent my friend a screenshot of one of Nicole’s texts, and followed it up with a long rant about how she’s always sending vague or confusing messages. You know, just venting a bit.

Well, in my rush to send the screenshot, I somehow sent it back to Nicole. Not only did I send the screenshot, but I sent my entire rant about her too. The second I realized what happened, I freaked out. I tried to unsend it, but of course, it was too late.

Nicole replied almost right away with a simple, “???” and I felt like the ground was gonna swallow me whole. I ended up trying to play it off like I was joking, but I could tell she didn’t buy it. Now every time we work together, things are super awkward, and I just want to avoid her at all costs.

&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;#39;ve fucked up and now don&amp;#39;t know what to do to. Any advice would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"This is a story from about 1978ish , when I lived at home with my parents in the UK. It's a story of manners, what ppl do to not offend. It's weird but I couldn't make this shit up to save my life. 

When I was about 14, I awoke to the sounds of our front door being knocked at the ungodly hour of about 1am &amp; then voices. My mum came upstairs and said our neighbour was in a bit of a state about his dog and she couldn't understand much of what he'd said &amp; got me up to go help her (dad was working a night shift). We went 3 doors up to the neighbour's house, they were Polish migrants from the war (he'd captained a boat at Dunkirk) and spoke just a smattering of English, most of it we (us kids) imagined as shouting Polish obscentites at his dog to come back from the field behind our houses. It wasn't a friendly dog, it would bark at us and it was we might call in the UK (back then anyway) a bit of a ""fat woofer"", none of that 'chunky' euphemism back then. 
On reaching their house we saw the dog in the front garden, whilst the wife was sobbing in the doorway with the husband holding her. Mum and I went over to the dog and it had passed away (insert Monty Python dead parrot sketch excerpt). But........my Mum has British middle class manners, manners with a heavy dose of British reserve and a cheeky bit of insanity thrown in. I whispered to her ""Mum, the dog's dead"", she hissed back ""ssssh pick him up, move his legs and we'll see if he wakes up, we have to do something to help them ""....so we picked up the pooch and in the style of a pair of demonic renanimators, ""walked"" him by his legs by hand across the garden. After about 6ft of this ungodly Punch and Judy show, I told my mum I was knackered, she whispered to me to put him down and curl him up. She then went over to the couple and told them he was sleeping and to take him to the vets tomorrow, she then grabbed me and we hoofed it away el pronto. 

But it only occurred to me some 40 odd years later, there might have been what we now call a ""comms issue"", with them being Polish with a limited English vocabulary and they quite possibly knew the dog was dead all that time and my mum had made me carry out this therapy-inducing act rather than ask them what they wanted us to do. Me? I just went back to bed and thought nothing of it, crazy shit like this happened all the time in 70's/80's.

,tifu,"I posted this story on another account many moons ago, but I couldn’t find it. So I thought I would make anyone feeling stupid today feel better about themselves, because this was dumbass incarnate. 

When I was 21, my ex and I stayed at a Motel 6 in a beach town for vacation because it was the only hotel we could afford. The motel was, well, a motel so it wasn’t ideal but it wasn’t so bad. Or so I thought…

We get back from our trip and we both noticed that we were insanely itchy. We had gone on a lot of hikes during the trip, so I thought we had stumbled upon poison oak. We did everything to treat it, but the itching persisted and even got worse. I grew up in a mountain town where poison oak is super common, and couldn’t help but notice our rashes were not consistent with that of poison oak. Instead of the swollen red rash you get, ours were more pimply with red lines.

We went to a local clinic and it turns out the Motel 6 room we stayed in gave us SCABIES. The doctor gave us both the medicine to cure it as well as instructions to clean out our homes and prevention measures so we wouldn’t spread it. 

During treatment, I was looking up ways to get rid of them a little faster. I read online that a bath with cayenne pepper burns the surface mites, so that’s what I decided to do. I missed the part where they said “Soak the *affected* area” and just jumped right in a bath with a ton of cayenne in it.

Suddenly, I felt the burn on both sides. I yelped and jumped out, tried to rinse off but nothing helped. I’m pretty sure I was crouched over in my room with an ice pack to the front butt for about an hour. And all I could think about was how stupid I was for thinking submerging my entire body in hot water with enough cayenne pepper to rip off someone’s taste buds was a good idea. I tried to burn them off; but in the end, I only burnt myself.

TL;DR: I got scabies from a Motel 6 and burnt my nether regions from trying to burn them with cayenne pepper, but I only burnt myself.

,tifu,"My girlfriend had an abusive ex, that only wanted her for her body. He would do awful stuff like forcing her to do stuff, or ""forgetting"" to put on a condom.

That was years ago, but it still affects her sex drive. Sometimes she wants to do it everyday,  othertimes she'll be reminded of her ex, and we won't do anything for months. Right now is one of those times, as we haven't done anything for almost half the year. It's really messing with her, and she often cries about it.

But tonight was a blessing and she wanted to do it again! 

After the deed was done, I cleaned myself up. That's where I noticed that the tip of the condom was ripped clean off, and I accidentally came in her.

Oh boy.

I told her this, and she began to panic. Like full blown panic attack, because she had experience this before, where she was forced to do the ""deed"", and her abusive ex bf didn't put on a condom. It was really traumatic for her.

So not only am I giving her a pregnancy scare, I'm also making her relive her worst experience. I'm trying to be as supportive as I can be, by buying the morning-after pill and some pregnancy tests when the pharmacy opens in a few hours. But she's really affected by it, and I'm not sure what to do other than comforting her.

I sometimes do really stupid things for example I'm typing this on a secret burner phone, I sneak out, I drink, I skip class, I smoke, I don't get good grades, In generall I just have a lot of secrets. Most of this is just escapism because life's a shit show but that doesn't make it good or right. 

Today I stayed up all night which is usual for me but about 1-2 hours ago I felt super tired and passed out on the couch and was immediately grounded when I woke up. 
Turns out my mom went in my room to grab some towels and found a mostly empty bottle of alcohol I had in my closet. She was so angry that she didn't yell she was just cold and had a tone that I dont know how to describe. She is also very adamantly against alcohol which doesn't help the situation.

She has never found out about anything like this and I don't know what to do. She's a pretty good mom for the most part and I know life's stressful for her. I mean she's a single mom of two teenagers working full time trying to navigate around her ex husband (my shit dad) trying to still control us it's stupidity stressful for her. I don't need to burden her with any more of my stupid problems than I already do. 

She mentioned something about inspecting my room. I've been grounded from all my devices. I'm not allowed to go anywhere (I don't have a single friend so that's not a big deal) She's really gonna be cracking down on me and I still dont have an idea of the full extent of the punishment as she is still thinking.

I'm aware that these are the consequences of my actions. I'm not trying to fight that, but Is there anything at all I can do or say to help with this situation. I just don't want her to hate me. I'm so lost and I'm freaking out. I genuinely don't have any idea what to do now.

I know this is quite lengthy sorry for that I just have a lot of words to say.

&lt;p&gt;Today I stayed up all night which is usual for me but about 1-2 hours ago I felt super tired and passed out on the couch and was immediately grounded when I woke up. 
Turns out my mom went in my room to grab some towels and found a mostly empty bottle of alcohol I had in my closet. She was so angry that she didn&amp;#39;t yell she was just cold and had a tone that I dont know how to describe. She is also very adamantly against alcohol which doesn&amp;#39;t help the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has never found out about anything like this and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. She&amp;#39;s a pretty good mom for the most part and I know life&amp;#39;s stressful for her. I mean she&amp;#39;s a single mom of two teenagers working full time trying to navigate around her ex husband (my shit dad) trying to still control us it&amp;#39;s stupidity stressful for her. I don&amp;#39;t need to burden her with any more of my stupid problems than I already do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She mentioned something about inspecting my room. I&amp;#39;ve been grounded from all my devices. I&amp;#39;m not allowed to go anywhere (I don&amp;#39;t have a single friend so that&amp;#39;s not a big deal) She&amp;#39;s really gonna be cracking down on me and I still dont have an idea of the full extent of the punishment as she is still thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m aware that these are the consequences of my actions. I&amp;#39;m not trying to fight that, but Is there anything at all I can do or say to help with this situation. I just don&amp;#39;t want her to hate me. I&amp;#39;m so lost and I&amp;#39;m freaking out. I genuinely don&amp;#39;t have any idea what to do now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is quite lengthy sorry for that I just have a lot of words to say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I&amp;#39;m a teenage girl and my mom found a bottle of alcohol in my room. I&amp;#39;m very grounded and she&amp;#39;s really upset with me. I don&amp;#39;t know how this will affect our relationship. I just don&amp;#39;t want her to hate me. I really just want to know if there is anything I can do to help this situation. 
I already fucked up I don&amp;#39;t want the fuck up to spiral. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I did make a throwaway account for this and I will probably be posting this on multiple subs just to try to get as much advice as possible)&lt;/p&gt;

So I'm happy married for over 10 years with 3 kids. 

We do take separate holidays occasionally while the other looks after the kids. Well few weeks ago was my turn and I went with my sister. 1 of the places we went to was octoberfest. 

We went for 2 days and on the 2nd day I admit I got a bit too drunk by the end of the night, fell asleep at the bus stop and got uber home. I may have drunk dialed my husband telling him I don't know how to order uber or where I am and he was already angry at me for this.


Now today is where is gets worse. We don't use WhatsApp much but we use it for school to organise things with the parents for the kids. A mum was trying to contact me but contacted my husband instead as she wondered if someone else has my number now because it's random people in the photo. 

So the photo was of a guy taking a selfie while standing next to a girl. I don't know either of them. My husband says he doesn't trust me, got super mad and pissed at me. Started yelling. Like I've never seen him this angry before! His reaction really shocked me. 

I explained I don't know them and obviously I didn't change the photo. Yes it's from octoberfest and looks to be around where I was sitting. My guess is I left my phone on the table (which I did often as we would stand up to dance many people did the same) and some guy decided to play a joke on me by uploading a photo of himself and his friend or his gf. 

Now my husband doesn't believe it and thinks I unlocked it for him because how would someone just have access to my phone.. Now I know it's too trusting of me but I was drunk and often left my phone open and on camera mode as I was often taking video and photos there. 

So being extremely stupid and not even realising this happened weeks ago.. Now my husband super mad at me. I've upset him. Look like at idiot on my WhatsApp parenting group too. Now I feel like my entire marriage is starting to fall apart.

,tifu,"Obligatory, this happened last night not today.

So my family and I took a trip to Las Vegas for a family member's wedding. We haven't eaten a full meal all day so we decided to go to a Chinese restaurant that we have been to before and really enjoy. One of the items we order was a pan fried soup dumpling (Sheng Jian) because we generally like the traditional soup dumpling (Xiao Long Bao), but this one was in a bun and pan fried. My mom described it as the filling of the Xiao Long Bao, just in a bun instead. Now for those that don't know, Xiao Long Bao is normal piping hot, and the right way to eat it is to put in on a spoon, poke a hole to let the soup out, then eat it after it cools a bit.

A couple minutes go by and out food is delivered, this is when the FU occurrs. I forgot that the Sheng Jian had soup in it, I assumed that it was just the meat inside and maybe the soup was absorbed by the bun. Boy was I wrong. I bit into the bun, it squirt its hot juice straight up into my nose and burned my nostril and upper lip. So now, here I am, the inside of my nostril is peeling and raw, new skin is starting to heal but is making my skin tight and it hurts to move and breathe. I should have known, and I have paid the price.

Now for those that don&amp;#39;t know, Xiao Long Bao is normal piping hot, and the right way to eat it is to put in on a spoon, poke a hole to let the soup out, then eat it after it cools a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple minutes go by and out food is delivered, this is when the FU occurrs. I forgot that the Sheng Jian had soup in it, I assumed that it was just the meat inside and maybe the soup was absorbed by the bun. Boy was I wrong. I bit into the bun, it squirt its hot juice straight up into my nose and burned my nostril and upper lip. So now, here I am, the inside of my nostril is peeling and raw, new skin is starting to heal but is making my skin tight and it hurts to move and breathe. I should have known, and I have paid the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I bit into a hot soup dumpling, and burned my nostril and upper lip.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"So the elevator in my apartment is out, and I've been having to walk up and down  a few flights of stairs for the past few days. No biggie, I could use the extra steps anyways.

I hit my head on  the railing, and right as I was telling him I was okay I lost my balance and fell backwards down a flight and a half of stairs.

I got to watch  the security camera feed after, and I was just rag dolling down the stairs after like the first few steps. I am just glad I didn't knock any teeth out. If there had been any sound on the camera feed I probably would have made a PLAP sound when I finally stopped  at the bottom of the stairs. But yeah, so now I am out of work for at least a few weeks.

,tifu,"So this happened last night, and I’m seriously considering quitting my job out of sheer embarrassment.

I’ve been talking to this girl for a couple of weeks now, and things have been going great. We’ve been getting a little flirty over text, so I decided to take things up a notch and send her a message that was… well, let’s just say it was way more forward than usual.

The message was supposed to say something like, “I can’t stop thinking about you… I swear, if I was there right now, I wouldn’t be able to keep my hands off you 😉.”

Yeah, you can already see where this is going.

Except I didn’t send it to her. I sent it to my boss.

Let me just paint the picture here: I’m sitting on my couch, thinking I’m being all smooth, and then I see the name at the top of the screen. It’s not her name. It’s my boss’s name. I literally felt my soul leave my body.

I freaked out so hard, I almost threw my phone across the room. Now, I’m sitting there trying to figure out if I can somehow recall the message, but it’s too late. There’s no taking it back. And this isn’t just a “whoops, wrong person” text—this is a full-on seductive message that I just sent to my superior.

About ten minutes later, I get a response: “Uh… I don’t think this was meant for me.”

I wanted to die right then and there. I mumbled some terrible excuse like, “OMG sorry, wrong number, haha, you know how it is, LOL!” But let’s be real, there’s no way to recover from that. Now I have to face him at work on Monday knowing he read that entire cringe-fest of a message.

,tifu,"Obligatory this happened about 4-5 years ago and only just thought about it while browsing reddit today.
For some context at the time that this happened I was working at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium during their Christmas light events if I remeber correctly. Essentualy is was cold and I was working later in the afternoon to evening. At the time I was wearing my leather jacket with wool lining as it was very cold but also because I would ride my motorcycle to work.This jacket completely covers up my work shirt which didn't help.

As to what happened, I was tasked with going to give a fellow coworker a break. After only a few seconds of leaving the office and walking towards the back of the zoo I had a honestly beautiful female guest walk up and ask essentually if I remembered them. This is where the fuck up started. I told her that I did not, but that she was also probably thinking that I was someone else. I'm a military brat and as such I lived in various states over the course of my life. She kept trying to jog my memory but it wasn't working if she was right and that we have met before.

The guest in question was even trying to convince me to come meet her mother who was on the other side of the area we were at. At which point I explained that I had work todo and said my goodbye. In retrospect I should have gone and asked her Number or even gone with her to see their mother. But at the time that isn't where my head was at and I was kicking my self later.

,tifu,"This is bad, I feel VERY awful.

I was on the train this morning, I was still sleepy, very irritable and trying to read an article for university in a language that is not my first and I get distracted very easily.

There was a man making some random noises, at first it sounded like he was just chewing a gum with his mouth open (which is something that I really can’t stand), then he kept clicking his tongue, whistling and so on.

I commented out loud to my friend how annoying it was and how those sounds were distracting me, I didn’t expect this person to hear me because at some point he was making a phone call and he was speaking a foreign language so I assumed he was a tourist or something.

And I was right, he did not speak my language, but he was there with a friend who did, he got to my seat and apologised if his friend was bothering me, but he has Tourette Syndrome and he really can’t help it.

Last weekend I visited an old college roommate up north of England. We took a day trip to Scotland and came by this little marked. 
There were handmade trinkets, food and clothes being sold, and we wandered around for a few hours tasting lager and local whisky.
Blissfully existing. 
Now to the FU

I was looking at these handmade woodland creatures on a table, studying the beautiful handcarved animals. At this point I had drank quite a bit, but I wasn't fully drunk, just slightly dazed. 
I had been standing there a while when I must have told the man i wanted one of the figures. 
To the question ""which"" I replied a bird. 
He pointed to a bird that was leaning to the ground eating seeds, smiled and said ""peck"" 
Taken aback I nodded, smiled and replied ""peck peck"" 
The guy chuckled as he looked at me ""no ye fuckface. Peck one. Choose one. Which one d'ya want"" 
My face flamed and I wish the ground would swallow me whole.

Well turns out this would be the start of it all. I ordered my Uber and barely anyone was driving today or everyone was like 15+ minutes away so I start stressing thinking imma be late to work but finally a driver is found and they're 11 minutes away.

So I'm literally a sitting duck in the back porch and I can't do anything. I ALSO HAVE TO GO TO WORK IN 8 MINUTES. 

I then realized how fucked and comical my situation is and start yelling and getting angry. I then cancel the Uber as he's been waiting there for like 3 minutes. I call in on my work to say I can't come in today (on my second day). I didn't have enough money for another Uber because I was down to my last few dollars and had to pay the cancellation fee for the Uber I already ordered.

,tifu,"Update: A week and a half of growth and I'm back to my sexy stubble of years ago - although in a somewhat greyer version. Marriage is saved! However... During 6 years of trying to convince me to trim my beard down, she somehow seems to have forgotten that sexy stubble is somewhat prickly, and she is now conflicted whether she prefers her sexy, but prickly husband or the less prickly handsome full bearded one. 😂



I (41M) have had a beard of some kind pretty much all my adult life. Last time I was clean shaven was exactly 20 years ago in 2004.

When I met my wife 12 years ago I had a short beard - ""sexy stubble"" about 5 mm (that's 0.2"" to our metrically challenged friends). The past 6 years or so I've sported a full grown beard.

My wife has told me loads of times, to trim my beard to the shorter version I used to have. She's never hidden the fact that she preferred it that way - especially when it got really long after I let it grow for a year or so.

Lately my 7 year old son has been saying he'd like to see me without the beard and we've had banter about it. Early this week my wife had long days at a conference and my son and I have been home due to holidays. On Monday I decided ""fuck it"" and took my beard off. I trimmed it down, and did a full clean shave.

My wife came home in the evening and hated it. She told me it was a huge turn off, told me I looked like my younger brother and that it felt weird. Now she won't kiss me or have sex with me before my beard grows back.

TL:DR: Shaved my beard for the first time in 20 years, now wife won't kiss me or have sex until it is grows back.


Edit: I've slightly exaggerated for the sake of the story. We've HAVE kissed, but she feels really weird about it, and the resemblance to my brother, who we don't have the best relationship with, throws her off.

There's been a fair bit of joking and teasing about it, and I really prefer myself with a beard as well.

Marriage is saved! However... During 6 years of trying to convince me to trim my beard down, she somehow seems to have forgotten that sexy stubble is somewhat prickly, and she is now conflicted whether she prefers her sexy, but prickly husband or the less prickly handsome full bearded one. 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I (41M) have had a beard of some kind pretty much all my adult life. Last time I was clean shaven was exactly 20 years ago in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I met my wife 12 years ago I had a short beard - &amp;quot;sexy stubble&amp;quot; about 5 mm (that&amp;#39;s 0.2&amp;quot; to our metrically challenged friends). The past 6 years or so I&amp;#39;ve sported a full grown beard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife has told me loads of times, to trim my beard to the shorter version I used to have. She&amp;#39;s never hidden the fact that she preferred it that way - especially when it got really long after I let it grow for a year or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately my 7 year old son has been saying he&amp;#39;d like to see me without the beard and we&amp;#39;ve had banter about it. Early this week my wife had long days at a conference and my son and I have been home due to holidays. On Monday I decided &amp;quot;fuck it&amp;quot; and took my beard off. I trimmed it down, and did a full clean shave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife came home in the evening and hated it. She told me it was a huge turn off, told me I looked like my younger brother and that it felt weird. Now she won&amp;#39;t kiss me or have sex with me before my beard grows back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL:DR: Shaved my beard for the first time in 20 years, now wife won&amp;#39;t kiss me or have sex until it is grows back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;ve slightly exaggerated for the sake of the story. We&amp;#39;ve HAVE kissed, but she feels really weird about it, and the resemblance to my brother, who we don&amp;#39;t have the best relationship with, throws her off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s been a fair bit of joking and teasing about it, and I really prefer myself with a beard as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s also apologised for been too &amp;quot;harsh&amp;quot; in her reaction, but she was caught off guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re happily married and very much love each other. Please refrain from name calling. &lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"We live in Southern BC, black bears are around town fattening themselves up. We have a small number of Apple trees in our yard.

We got a new dog this week, he is a 9 month old German Shephard rescue. He is wonderful, still working on name recall etc.

Last night I let the dog out into our fenced yard for a toilet break before bed. I saw them too late, a decent sized Mumma black bear and a smaller cub in the back corner. He was off after them before I could react. Due to the size/shape of the Yard the Mumma bear hurried her cub up the closest tree and followed it after. I ran inside to grab the dogs lead and a can of bear spray we keep around (we get bears a lot).

A good 20 mins of him barking/lunging at them and the bears hissing/fake charging back.

I decided it was not going to resolve itself, the bears were not going anywhere (fenced in yard, unsure how they got in - perhaps over the back smaller fence) and I was not able to call the Dog to heel or get his lead onto him.

I decided to open the side gates around our house to give the bears 2 ways out, as I was securing the gate through our carport to the front (and hopefully a way out for the bears), I had the bear spray in my hand and accidentally leaned against the trigger (it's a top press, and I had the safety off when the bear started charging and I thought he might try and run up onto our back porch).

It was only a quick spray, but it was in an enclosed space (car port) and I was done. Blind and burning I stumbled out into the front and lay on the lawn. The dog noticed I was gone and to his credit came to check on me, fortunately I heard him and still had his lead in my hand, so was able to connect it to his collar and I fumbled us in the side door (from carport) and locked it behind us. Bear problem solved, I had bigger issues though.

Ended up filling sink with water and dunking my head in there for a few minutes, which helped a little, then I was in the shower for a good 20mins flushing my face under the water. Came good about 35mins post spray, no ongoing effects.

This morning, I go out to clean up the mess, I close the gates, check on the trees, the dog runs around sniffing everything and I go back inside. There is the real TIFU I guess, I had not considered residual bear spray on the door handle and frame for the gate, when I came back inside I wiped the inside of my eye and it hit me again. F, back in the shower for another 15 minutes, luckily just the one eye. Several hours later I feel like I have a mild sunburn.

I need to go back to the carport and hose everything down, ill wear gloves and PPE this time.

TLDR: I was clumsy and bear sprayed myself in the face, forgot about residual spray and post cleanup today got it back in my eyes again.

,tifu,"Hi guys, first TIFU for me, at least one that makes me feel really bad.

I just moved to a new house with my girlfriend and we are in the typical process, cleaning, unpacking, etc.

She was about to bring her cats with her today, went to the vet with the little guys for a check and vaccinations, i was going with her but i felt a bit sick with stomach ache and told her that i prefer to stay home and do some stuff meanwhile she's out, she then asked me if i could install her computer in the living room and i went with it.

Her room was always kinda dusty so I decided to clean the computer a bit, and then her TV screen too, which was really messy and you couldn't see well, here's where i f'd up real bad...

The screen was as clean as it gets, and i was proud of it, so proud i messaged her she was going to feel like the screen was now 4k because the dirt now is gone, and then she felt really concerned, and asked me if a cleaned the frame alone or the screen too.

I told her i cleaned it all and then she tells me that a paw print from her late little kitten, which died being 1 y/o  was on that screen, and that's why she didn't clean the screen before.

Worst part is that i knew it, but this happened like 3 years ago and I didn't remember it, she was understanding, knew I didn't do it on purpose and is completely okay with me as if nothing had happened, but i'm feeling awful and I wish I had a time machine...

I work in the tool rental section of a home improvement store. A few days ago, a lady came in with a small doorknob attached to a backing and asked if we had a screwdriver to remove the screw. This is not unusual and we help with small things like that when we can. 
I checked the screw head(#2 Phillips, not really relevant), grabbed the screwdriver from the back, cane back to the counter and handed it to her. She seemed a little suprised but took it anyways.
She positioned the screwdriver between the knuckles of her pointer and ring fingers and started awkwardly twisting. I took a look and realized that the lady had no thumbs! No scars or anything, I can only guess she was born without them(I wasn't about to ask for clarification).
I figured it would be easier and quicker if I did it myself(and hopefully less embarrassing for her). 
I looked at her and stupidly said the first thing that popped into my head, ""you need a hand?""
I knew it the moment I said it. She kinda pushed the whole thing at me not looking too happy. The screw turned out to be one of those uber-fine thread machine screws approx 4"" long.

She eventually found a friend several hours later to come find me and got me home where I threw up a few more times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, the bike was also gone but the lock was left on the bike rack. I see it almost as a message to how stupid I was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl:dr &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took 20mg of gummies then realized I left my bike at the gym. Broadcasted to Uber drivers the combo to my lock. Rushed out and got severely sick. Bike was gone. Puked and slept at the bathroom at my office before a friend saved me. &lt;/p&gt;

So, it was a painfully hot summer and fall has been nowhere to be found, therefore the hedges in the front yard were monstrous from neglect. I decided that it was cool enough in the mornings to go out and tackle those bad boys and be in before it started getting to warm. I put on zip up jacket over my t shirt, to protect from bug bites and such and went to work. Behind the hedges, and growing up around the windows were these annoying invasive unsightly vines. So I started pulling them off the house and using the electric trimmer to chop them up. Everything seemed to fine. I went inside and immediately showered and washed my clothes.
The next morning my hand was terribly itchy, and I assumed I had gotten a bug bite or two. But later that morning my eye was also incredibly itchy. It seemed to get worse and worse throughout the day. Saturday morning I noticed some hives on my forearms. I have autoimmune issues, so a bug bite can cause me to break out in hives sometimes. However, my eye was starting to get pretty swollen and I was super itchy. The rash kept spreading and getting worse and by Monday morning I looked like Quasimodo, I could barely open my eye and my whole face was swollen and red. I was so freaking confused and worried. It wasn't until today that all the hives on my hands and arms were covered in the world's grossest bubble wrap (blisters everywhere) that I had a flashback to that time I got poison ivy as a teenager. I ran outside and used Google Lens on the vines that still remained and it came up... 
Poison Ivy.
What the actual heck? I literally did not know that poison ivy can grow up your house in vines (although I should have, duh, IVY). So my dumb ass was pulling and chopping up poison ivy vines without gloves. And somehow it not only penetrated my jacket but it managed to get through my bra and t shirt as well. This is a painful but well received lesson to learn

,tifu,"Oblig:  This happened a long time ago, back when McDonalds used to fry their cherry pies into crispy crusted morsels of heaven instead of microwaving them into limp blobs of disappointment.  So technically It's more of ""That One Time I Fucked Up.""  
  
The proper forms have been satisfied.  Let's move on.  
  
My first day as a McDonalds employee, I was given the easy assignment of working the less busy fry station.  Back then, fish sandwich patties were dropped in oil and fried until golden crisp.  So were the cherry pies, but they were fried in a separate vat for obvious reasons.  Some genius decided to put these two fry vats next to each other.  Another genius came along and decided to not put labels on either of them.  To be fair, I believe the frozen patties and pies were stored in separate freezers next to their respective vats (flanking the conjoined vats, as it were).  
  
Being new, I had no idea which was which.  So when the manager yelled ""drop six pies!"" across the counter top, I did exactly that:  I put six frozen cherry pies into the little rack that held them and dropped the rack and pies into the fry vat.  The Filet O'Fish fry vat to be precise.  
  
A few minutes later, a half dozen beautiful bubbly crusted cherry pies emerged, golden brown and seemingly delicious.  They sold immediately, so I was told to do it again.  Which I did.  Nice job, /u/tillerman35!  You're our best new employee ever!  (That's what I thought I would hear in a few minutes)  
  
It didn't take long for customers to storm the counter asking to speak to the manager.  Apparently, frying cherry pies in oil that had previously held a day's worth of frozen fish patties imparts a certain piquant flavor to the pies.  Cod-flavored cherry pies might be a thing in some countries.  I don't know.  I've never checked.  But it wasn't something midwestern American palates were accustomed to.  Perhaps I was a bit too avant garde.  
  
So that's how I learned how to drain and refill a fry vat on my first day working at McDonalds.  All the customers who complained got their money back and a fresh hot cherry pie.  Those who left with take-out pies probably suffered, for which I've felt some residual guilt over the years.  If you were at a McDonalds and got a fishy tasting cherry pie, it was probably my fault and I apologize.  
  
tl;dr:  Put the frozen cherry pies into the fish fryer.  Made fishy pies.  People complained.  My bad.  
  
Bonus FU:  One time, after I had graduated to burger flipper, I wrapped wet grill towel in cheeseburger paper and put it under the warmer as a joke.  I had intended to trick my fellow employee, who was about to go on lunch break (we were allowed one free burger).  But before I could slap the fake burger on a tray for him, someone snagged it, put it in a bag, and handed it to a drive-through customer.  
  
We never saw the customer again.  Somewhere, there's a person still pissed off that McDonalds sold the a soggy, hot, greasy, linen towel in place of a cheeseburger.

As I was heading to the bathroom I thought ""let's just grab my phone on the way there"" so I went to get it from the living room, picked it up, looked forward and my eyes were locked on a room full of people, mostly elderly, enjoying some beverages.

I am sure they saw me; too much of me, my partner had opened the blind and aired the room before going to work.

I can't say for sure but they looked like they all knew each other which points towards them been a group or club that decided to go donate blood together.

,tifu,"Just needing to vent about this...

A few weeks ago, I struck a vehicle while driving a company vehicle. 100% my fault. I felt terrible. Co workers had to come pick me up, because I was shaking so hard I didn't trust myself to drive.

When I came around to check on her and her car, she immediately launched in swearing and threatening to sue. I was like, welp, I don't need this and went to wait for the police away from her. A witness came forward to check on us, and she started screaming at him too.

She must have a reputation, because a second witness gave me his information and said he'd tell the police she was in a no parking zone and she pulled forward while I was parking. That wasn't what happened and I was obviously at fault, but it made me feel a little better. I probably should have taken it as a warning, in hindsight.

When the police arrived, I told them she was a touch hostile so I hadn't spoken to her much. (She was apparently hostile with him too, because I heard him raise his voice and threaten to write her a ticket if she continued to argue with him.) 

The next day, she showed up at work and tried to get me fired. My manager told her I followed protocol and phoned the police to report it. Anything else is none of her business.

Today, I received a letter at my home address from her insurance company stating they're going to charge me for damages. (Apparently these things are common but usually go to the insurance company - and I know she has that information, so it just feels like it was a deliberate decision to send it to my house rather than the company or their insurance.)

So now I'm upset all over again. My first accident would involve a Karen...

,tifu,"Today I was coming home and was in a right lane. There is a right turn I use to go home near a convenience store. I have used it many times for at least five years. There are zebra crossing lines where Pedestrians can walk in the lane I was about to turn into, but I never really noticed it. In fact, until today I never saw a pedestrian cross whenever I was about to turn, I guess I was lucky. In fact, I didn't even know what those lines were until I got home.

  
Anyway, onto what happened. I was turning basically on autopilot as soon as the light was green like I have many times before and suddenly I see a pedestrian crossing same street as that lane, taking me by surprise because it had never happened to me before in this particular turn. This person was staring forwards, and I stepped on the brakes, hoping that enough of my car was off the street so that the people behind me before I turned wouldn't smash into whatever part of my car was sticking out of the lane I had just begun to turn into. The guy was soon out of the way, and I stared ahead, hands clenching the wheel the whole way home. I sat in the car for a while checking to see if I broke the law and finding out what those stripes the guy was walking on for the first time since I began driving. 

  
I am relieved that this didn't end in everyone getting hurt. The guy was already in the first of two lanes halfway across the street when I started turning IIRC, and with the way he was starring ahead I'm not sure if he even knew I was there. I am also glad that the back of my vehicle likely wasn't sticking out into the same lane as the traffic light I'd used to turn in the first place, blocking people or worse forcing them to stop to avoid getting banged on the side.

  
I still feel guilty. Is the whole thing my fault or should the pedestrian have checked both sides to see if anyone was coming before crossing? How likely is it that the police or courts will come for me for a traffic violation?

  
It's a thing I do a lot, worrying about how past events that could have gone differently or didn't happen at all and how my life could've changed by them. This was most recent so I'm wondering, ""What if I hit the guy and he died? If he didn't die? What would my punishment be if I stayed and called 9/11? Could I have been imprisoned for years or even executed for his death?"" Or ""What if the other cars in the lane I used to turn kept coming and my car hadn't fully turned, would they have stopped in time or would they all crash in this massive pileup?"" I've been doing it more and more these days and I truly am scared that the day I fuck up in a way I can't take back might come. I know the past can't be changed and so I fear the possibility someone might actually die because if I make a mistake like this.

TL;DR I turned right at a solid green light when driving when someone was crossing the street, and I feel I could have hit the pedestrian or caused a pileup and feel really guilty about it.

Hello you can call me kujo. I'm a 18yr old college student going for culinary arts. I currently have a temp license and today was the day that I went to go to a driving test to get my full license. I live in ohio and have to go through Dead Man's Curve twice a day eight times a week, and I must say that it's definitely a hard turn for anyone, but my parents say that I handle the curve really good everytime I go through it. So when I went to go take my driving test today I had high hopes that I would pass. I did the first part (the maneuver ability test) really well, with only tapping a cone a little with the edge of the right side view mirror. Then the instructor had me do the road portion of the test, I stopped right before every stop sign and edged up to the road to check for any cars before continuing to either turn or keep going forward. Exept for one thing, I missed one fucking stop sign, I was focused on trying to keep in the speed limit (heavy foot syndrome is a bitch) and completely missed the one stop sign...  the instructor even said that I would've passed if I stopped for the stop sign. Now I have to attend four hours of instructor driving and 24 hours of driving with either of my parents.

,tifu,"Okay. The characters in this story include me (16NB), my friend Carly (17f), and my other friend Sandra (18f). Sandra and Carly are not close but are on civil terms. I'm equally close with both of them. All the names are fake.

 Sandra and I had a lot of issues throughout our friendship. We met when I was 14 and she was 16 so I was a pretty immature kid and did a lot of stupid stuff to her. We had a few massive fights and I didn't know how to handle my feelings about them so I ended up forwarding our private conversations to a whole bunch of people, some friends, some acquaintances. Sandra confronted me about this when she found out and ever since then I have been working hard to gain her trust back. I haven't forwarded a single message of hers to anyone since... until now.

About 2 months ago Sandra and I had a pretty huge fight and it ended with her leaving a virtual choir that we were in together because she felt uncomfortable around me. She had texted the choir director saying that she left the group because I was making her uncomfortable. However, we ended up making up soon after and she returned to the choir. We haven't had a fight since.

 For a bit of context, the choir has a 3 strike system. If you get 3 strikes, then you will be kicked out. This is where Carly comes into the picture. She made a comment that made another choir member uncomfortable. This choir member also happens to be a close friend of mine. Carly frantically texted me, freaking out that she may have ended up on the choir strike system because of the comment she made. To make her feel better, I told her that I was probably also on the strike system due to my situation with Sandra, and that none of this was a big deal, we were all still in the choir and things were peaceful now. Carly, who already knew about my fight with Sandra, asked me if Sandra had told the choir director about our fight and how I was making her uncomfortable. Out of instinct, I simply just forwarded Carly the message from Sandra where she told me about telling the choir director. Carly responder with ""Oh shit,"" I emphasized the message, turned off my phone and went to bed.

When I woke up this morning, the first thing I remembered was my conversation with Carly. I immediately realized that I had messed up, considering I had promised Sandra that I wouldn't forward her messages anymore yet I had forwarded one to Carly anyway. I immediately told Sandra about the situation and apologized. I really hope she doesn't get mad at me since I didn't talk crap about Sandra to Carly, all I did was answer Carly's message about Sandra telling the choir director about our fight, but I'm still terrified because I could have explained that to Carly without forwarding the message. Well, I guess I'll find out later, when I actually muster up the courage to turn my phone back on...

,tifu,"It’s in the oven now. I have no clue what it’s going to turn out to be. 

I wanted to make a coffee flavoured sponge cake.
So i took all the supplies out and organized the things i need in order to bake. 

Eggs, flour, sugar, soda, melted butter. I was so hooked on the butter that i started off whipping the melted butter (room temp) , sugar, beating the shiz out of them both. And wanting to bring it to a peak fluffy consistency.  Somethings wrong. It isnt working, but it certainly tastes yummy.  A perfect mix for a pastry, but I’m making a cake. 

ThEN, i add eggs. Mix mix mix. As i am whipping and seeing the butter kind of granulate and also foam up mixed with the egg, I’m wondering, why is it still yellow! It’s supposed to be white and whip into a meringue consistency. Then it clicks. I fucked up. Instead of starting with eggs and i started with butter. 

I then tried to fix it, more soda,  it still feels a bit dense and flat. It doesnt fix it. Add flour,  a tiny bit more of soda, still not as fluffy as cake batter is supposed to be! Added a dash of cold milk. And it didnt help anything either. 

Now the butter batter has become a little grainy because of cold milk, and the flour a bit foamy but nowhere near the ideal cake consistency. 

I finally called it quits and threw the mix into the oven. I have no clue what tf it’s going to turn out to be. A flat cake? Brownie? Biscuit? I have no clue. Atleast the flavours all there. 

This wasn’t my first time baking a cake!! I’ve made a few delicious ones but tifu. 😓

,tifu,"I (27) have an aunt (50s?) on my mom's side of the family that I'm not really close to, we see eachother at Christmas and that's mostly it. Sometime last year she started telling my dad (who I live with since my parents separated) that she wanted to spend time getting to know me and I should come spend the night at her flat so we can bond or whatever. I was hesitant at first cause I really don't like sleeping anywhere that's not my bed and I've just never been that close with my mom's side of the family since they're upper class snobbish types. 

This time of year I have some free time and I thought ""why not get to know my kooky aunt?"" Because I will definitely be the kooky distant relative someday. (Also I'm trying to get my money up by hanging out with rich people tbvh). Anyway so I give her a call and tell her I'd like to come over in a few days and she was really excited, she almost didn't believe I called cause she gave me her number almost a year ago lol. So I'm going about my day, watching trashy reality TV, when my mom calls like an hour after I speak with my aunt and says my aunt told her I'm coming over.

This is where it gets weird... my mom tells me very ominously ""when you get there, be careful."" 

WTF IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? I obviously ask her what she means and she continues very ominously, ""it's not a matter for over the phone."" Ok so now my anxiety is conjuring the worst scenarios imaginable at my aunt's place, I'm legit imagining her as jigsaw. I'm thinking she's going to drug me and sell my organs on the black market. 

Once I talk myself down from the true crime ledge (cause as much as my relationship with my mom is strained I don't think she'd be this vague if she actually thought I'd get murdered) I'm trying to figure out what she means so I keep asking. Eventually she just says ""You're an adult, you should know what I mean."" BITCH👏🏼STOP👏🏼BEING👏🏼SO👏🏼VAGUE👏🏼

After this call I'm genuinely worried what she's talking about but I also think that my unmarried, childless aunt with 4 cats might be setting off lesbian alarm bells for my family and given that we live in a place where being gay could get you the death penalty I think maybe that's what she's trying to say in the most deranged way possible. I don't care if she's gay, it would literally be a non factor; but I would like to know if she has a habit of stabby sleepwalking or some shit before I go spend the night on her couch!

,tifu,"I run a gaming center. Six guys played for three hours. As I was closing the center at the end of the night, I realized a controller was missing. I checked my CCTV and noticed that the last person who used the controller had just placed it on the couch. It was a black controller on a black couch, so it was perfectly camouflaged in the CCTV footage. After the game, one of the six guys placed his bag on the couch and put his black water bottle in it. As he was doing this, another guy stood directly between him and the camera, so his movements weren't clearly visible. However, I saw him turn the bag, pick a small black object off the couch, and place it inside the bag. I immediately suspected that it was him.

You have to understand that controller theft is quite common here. I've caught some twelve people in the last six months. That's why I collect IDs and contact numbers.

I called the guy, but he didn't pick up. I tried three more times, and he hung up on me the last time. This led me to conclude that it was him. So I sent him a text explaining the situation and gave him time to call me back, or I would file a complaint with the police. He called me back and denied all my accusations. I thought he was lying but he was so confident that it made me doubt myself. I felt extremely guilty, so I went back to the CCTV footage and reviewed everything for five more hours. Finally, I found the real culprit. I was devastated. The small object that the guy placed in his bag was a second smaller black water bottle.

The guilt of wrongly accusing someone was unbearable. I explained everything in a text to him, apologizing profusely.

The only text I received back was, ""bro, think twice before you blame someone."" That was it. I apologized again, but there was no reply. I called, but he didn't pick up.

I feel terrible about what I did. I jumped to conclusions, and an innocent person got hurt. I can't forgive myself.

However, I saw him turn the bag, pick a small black object off the couch, and place it inside the bag. I immediately suspected that it was him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to understand that controller theft is quite common here. I&amp;#39;ve caught some twelve people in the last six months. That&amp;#39;s why I collect IDs and contact numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called the guy, but he didn&amp;#39;t pick up. I tried three more times, and he hung up on me the last time. This led me to conclude that it was him. So I sent him a text explaining the situation and gave him time to call me back, or I would file a complaint with the police. He called me back and denied all my accusations. I thought he was lying but he was so confident that it made me doubt myself. I felt extremely guilty, so I went back to the CCTV footage and reviewed everything for five more hours. Finally, I found the real culprit. I was devastated. The small object that the guy placed in his bag was a second smaller black water bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guilt of wrongly accusing someone was unbearable. I explained everything in a text to him, apologizing profusely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only text I received back was, &amp;quot;bro, think twice before you blame someone.&amp;quot; That was it. I apologized again, but there was no reply. I called, but he didn&amp;#39;t pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel terrible about what I did. I jumped to conclusions, and an innocent person got hurt. I can&amp;#39;t forgive myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR : A controller went missing in my gaming center. My cctv footage wasn&amp;#39;t clear. Saw one guy place something in his bag. Jumped to conclusion that it was my controller. Confronted him over the call and he denied all my accusations. I reviewed the cctv footages again for 5 hours and found the real culprit. Feeling extremely guilty now.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"My wife is trying to start an in-home bakery at the moment. I was in our kitchen trying to assist her in doing some clean up after getting her dough mixed. This week’s menu includes a jalapeño cheddar loaf. 

She had diced the peppers after scooping out the insides and I was in the process of getting the seeds and membranes into the trash when one or more of our five kids (all under 10) got into something else. It’s usually pretty chaotic at our house 😔 

Anyway, finished cleaning up the pepper guts and addressing the other immediate issues with the kids. Then, I decided to go use the restroom… so now I have a burning shaft. It’s tolerable and I would say about comparable to when some sneaks a bit of icy hot into your jockstrap, but I’m most definitely not having a good time.

,tifu,"Happened like 6 years ago but still haunts me today. Wasn’t thrilled with my current job and was looking for opportunities. MIL had a friend who was a long time secretary/office manager for the owner of a small but very successful commercial copier/printer company. They had an opening in management that would have been a dream for me at the time. She was able to get me an interview immediately with the owner. 

Always hated job interviews. Get more nervous for those than literally anything. Pair that with how much I wanted this gig… I was a mess going in. 

Show up the day of. Meet the owner and I’m 1 on 1 with him in his office. Guys mid 50s, easy to talk to, cool dude. Interview is super relaxed, he’s laughing telling examples of things, even light heartedly cursing a couple times. I’m still nervous on edge, but got more comfortable as it went on. 

Thing was doing great, seemed like I was nailing it, then towards the end he says ‘I ask this of everyone I interview, what’s your go to ice breaker joke?’ I still distinctly remember my rear end legitimately puckering up. I froze. Mind went blank. I don’t really tell jokes. I don’t really know any, and certainly don’t have a go to one. I actually think I was about to faint or pass out, when I suddenly remembered the joke my wife’s friend told us just the past weekend….

….now I preface this by saying my wife’s friend ‘Jackie’ is super nice, but very inappropriate pretty much all the time. Curses constantly, no shame with sex talk or jokes. We were walking with a small group into an MLB game once and as she walked passed a guy she found attractive she loudly declared ‘God Damn I would drain his ballsack’. Just one of dozens of one liners she’s dropped. 

So we saw her at a kids bday party of all places a few days prior, and she greets us with this calamity of a joke…. 

‘What is another term for ejaculating in a woman? LOADING THE DISHWASHER’. 

Wife and I just scoffed a bit, shook our heads, said hi and moved on. 

Back to the interview… you guessed it. Sure enough in my panic, frozen state, feeling dizzy and potentially close to fainting, my mind identified that moment and that ‘joke’, and it just came out. The mix of my hysteria with the relaxed vibes the owner was giving out apparently gave my brain the idea that telling this joke was the move. I never talk like that. Like ever. It must have been just a last grasp of my subconscious to fill his request. 

He stared at me for a few seconds. Had a look like a mix of astonishment and disgust. Finally just said ‘ok then, well thanks for coming in’. Stood up, shook my hand and opened the door for me. I walked out and the door shut right behind me. I just kept walking, through the rest of the office and out the front door straight to my car, got in, immediately pulled out and got out of there. I stopped at a convenience store a few minutes down the road, parked and just sat there, incredulous. 

Not only did I not get the job, which based on the interview up until that point I likely had a great chance at getting, but also I had to face my MIL, who obviously was told by her friend what happened. Wasn’t exactly my finest moment.

Anyway, they kept telling me that I need to leave her because they claimed she was destroying my life, manipulating me, and not giving effort in the relationship. All to get to the point of me breaking up with her. I took my puppy from the apartment as well as all my possessions to my parents house, where I left originally because I was tired of the way they treated me. I (21M) moved out with my fiancé (19F) to start our lives together, but now we are split up. I am living at my parents house and she is living at the apartment. I went to have a conversation with my fiancé about moving forward, and to bring up the things my family wanted me to talk with her about: Taking over my own phone plan and splitting from hers, splitting rent down the middle instead of our budget schedule, and getting her car key back because the car is loaned and registered in my name, she is an insured driver of it. This all came to a screeching halt when I realized that “woah, I’m allowed to have my own thoughts and feelings” and I spoke with my fiancé that we need to take some time to process the last year we had been together, and sort out some of our faults on our own time.

The way I see it, I would prefer to improve and fight to live a happy life with my woman rather than try to please my family. I fucked up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: TIFU by breaking up with my fiancé after my family manipulated me into thinking she was bad for me. I now live separate from her, and we both want to improve to be a fantastic couple. I am in limbo because the moment I choose my fiancé, is the moment I disconnect likely entirely from my family.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"After a double shift at work left me with a bad migraine, I took some excedrin before laying down on the couch and put on a long boring documentary to help me fall asleep. Since I got back to my apartment late around 2am, I put my earbuds in as to not disturb my neighbors. 

About an hour later, in a half-dream state I thought I was choking on a pill and reflexively swallowed it. As soon as I did, my eyes shot open as I realized I couldn’t have swallowed a pill. My right earbud was on my chest but my left earbud was nowhere to be found. I was still groggy but I turned on my flashlight and started looking around the couch. 10 minutes of searching later and still nothing. Fearing the worst, I tried to make myself throw up but I all I got was bad heartburn. So, I did what any normal person would do, I drank a bunch of coffee and contemplated the life choices that led me to this point while waiting for urgent care to open. 

A few hours and incredulous doctors later, I have some beautiful x-rays of my abdomen and a referral to the ER in case the battery in the earbud is dissolved in my stomach acid. Unfortunately they gave me my x-rays on a cd so I’ll have to find a computer with a cd player before I can show off my stupidity.

,tifu,"So I was packing up my stuff because I had to move it all from where it was stored. It was all packed into a barn across a rather large field so I had a tractor that I was using to move it all. As I was finishing packing it all up to drive across the large field I noticed that some people started to show up. I have no idea what they were there for but I got bad vibes and just generally wanted to avoid them. I attempted to drive the tractor kind quickly hoping to not be noticed, but of course some guy comes running up and just immediately starts digging through my stuff!!!! I crawl my way down the tractor and ask him what the fuck he’s doing. He immediately gets confrontational and I start to yell while grabbing my stuff and putting it back on the tractor. He comes up behind me and wraps his arm around my neck which really freaks me out and of course I fight back and bite down on his arm.

,tifu,"So today I (24m) was walking home from work around 5pm. There’s this small tunnel under some train tracks that connects two streets, and I was walking toward it on a shared bike-pedestrian path, listening to music. I hear a rental scooter behind me, ringing its bell. My music wasn’t loud, so I could hear everything. I moved to the right as soon as I heard it to let the scooter pass and even gestured with my hand to show I was moving aside.

As I reached the tunnel, I glanced back to make sure everything was fine. But suddenly, the girl on the scooter, going at high speed, trips right in front of me. I felt bad, so I asked, ""Omg, are you okay?"" But she snapped, ""You moved in front of me, you fucking idiot.""

I don’t like conflict, so I apologized again, asking if she was okay. Then she screams, ""OH, FUCK OFF."" I was still trying to see if she needed help, but then she bends over and lets out this horror movie scream, I honestly had never seen something like that in real life. At this point, I was checking her arms and legs to see if she was injured, it seemed that she just tripped and quickly recovered. She was wearing a helmet, too, so it didn’t seem like she had any serious injuries. I apologized again, but she yelled, ""FUCK OFF, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.""

After that, I started walking away slowly since she clearly didn’t want me around. I heard her screaming again, ""FUUUUUUUCK, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE."" That’s when I picked up the pace because I honestly thought she might retaliate. This happened just a few blocks from my house, so I took some side streets to make sure she didn’t follow me.

The whole thing was really odd. I feel bad for her because it seemed like she was going through something bigger than just the fall. But honestly, she had no business going full speed in such a small tunnel (about 8 ft wide).

I thought about posting this on AITA, but I feel like it was just one of those weird encounters. Maybe I shouldn’t have moved, maybe she shouldn’t have been speeding. Either way, I’m sure this left an impact on both of us.

,tifu,"I think we all know where this was going.

I’ve been talking to this guy for about a month, so everything is very new and we are still getting to know one another. I also recently underwent a huge storm in my area so I couldn’t actually use my bathroom very frequently for the past like 3 days. He invites me over as he got power back before I did, and we haven’t seen each other in about two weeks between the storm,life, travels. I go over, everything is fine, we get dinner and have a good time and then we start to kind of reel it in for bed. 

I go to the bathroom to shower and “prep” if you will for potential nighttime festivities. And prep I did. For, evidently, a different type of festivities. See those 3 days really smacked me all the sudden and there was no turning back. I figure - hey, first time for everything, a girls gotta go when a girls gotta go. I muster the courage to overcome my anxiety with using the toilet outside of my home. Mission accomplished.

….
Nope. Ok well sometimes you need a two-Fer right?? Maybe he didn’t hear that first flush anyway…the toilet gurgles at me in a laughably cruel way. No dice. Ok. Not the end of the world. Surely this guy has a plunger. 
No. Not on the floor, not in the cabinet. I run out to the kitchen, maybe he’s got one of those weird kitchen plungers?? Nope. 
He’s in the shower in the other bathroom. I wait for him, sheepishly, to finish up.
It’s been a minute though, maybe- just maybe- the bathroom gods will have mercy on me, the 3rd flush will really just send my demon to its jail in hell. 

3rd flush. The toilet now roars at me, as it bubbles up WAY too quickly and begins to overflow everywhere and flood the bathroom (mercifully, just “clean” water as the monster was stuck down in the belly of the beast). My shower towel is a casualty in the battle, I try and fail to catch the waterfall of toilet water with it it’s soaked through and now there is standing water around the basin. I am panicking, holding back tears as I realize I now have to directly ask this man for a plunger and somehow clean his bathroom which I have successfully demolished. 

He finishes showering. Instead of approaching the situation with any sense of normalcy, I panic and say “hey! Just lay down I’m gonna grab something from your master bathroom I think I need.” He does so. He’s so sweet. 

no plunger. my life is flashing before my eyes. I now finally cave “hey, do you have a plunger???” 


“No…” 

The tears are involuntary as I laugh-cry at him, begging him not to help me, I mop and clean his entire bathroom while forcing him to stay in his bedroom. The bathroom is clean. The toilet has “drained” enough to seem as though nothing has happened. I cannot calm down. He knows something has happened, I told him I flooded it, but not how. I’m sure he can piece it together. 

There are no nighttime festivities, I am too mortified to even look him in the eyes. The morning comes. My dignity is crushed and it is palpable. We part ways, he is still kind as ever and trying to laugh the situation off. I get home. I get a text.

They decided to wake THE ENTIRE HOUSE UP with an “OHHHHH” this morning. My sister in law went to go and see what the problem was. I heard a muffled “froggy went a-courting”. Subsequently followed up by a door slamming and a very exhausted voice saying “for FUCKS sake”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I might stay in the spare bedroom as long as I can. But, as a younger sister, kinda happy I’ve annoyed my older brother. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR - I introduced Tom and Jerry to my young nephews. They loved it and decided to sing it first thing this morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C-c-c-crambone!&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"TIFU by hanging out with a friend who's in love with me 

I (M23) have a very close friend (M25), who I’ll call Adrien.  We are in a friend group together. We’re all pretty social awkward, autistic or bad at picking up on social cues in one way or another.  It’s what helps us get along so well, I think, the shared experience.  We play video games together, watch retro movies, play dnd, basically the textbook image of a group of nerds.  

Both Adrian and I are recent college graduates.  He majored in a field that you can find a job in just about anywhere, but there are a few ideal opportunities for him within an hours drive.  I, however, have a more niche career path.  There are some remote options related to my major, but most things would be in a big city.  We currently both live with our respective parents while looking for better prospects and are currently unemployed.  

Adrian is the closest friend I’ve ever had.  We've been close for almost five years now.  Growing up I didn’t have friends, let alone very close ones.  Even in college, I was usually too busy to have that much time to socialize, and I frankly wasn’t very good at it.  This group is a bit of a lifesaver for me.  And Adrian is the best friend I never had.  He's imperfect, but when we became frineds, for the first time in my life I felt understood.  We’re on the same wavelength about a lot of things.  He really appreciates me and listens when I talk.  We have a lot of the same interests, even deeper and more specific than the nerdy stuff the whole group likes.  I love spending time with him.  I always felt safe around him.  He's a wonderful person to be around and I’ve never felt so close to someone.  

Here’s the unfortunate twist - I am aromantic and asexual.  I’m not very open about it, as I don’t like explaining and justifying to people.  I mean, its gotta be confusing, and especially since I’m autistic, I have to sound like some sort of robot or alien when I explain it.  I still love deeply, just not in a 'dating' sort of way.  But I openly support the queer community (I think I'm technically part of it?  Idk.) and Adrien is openly queer.  

Unfortunately, I never told Adrien that I dont swing in any direction and he caught feelings.  About a year ago, he asked me out.  I can honestly say that I didn’t see it coming.  I’m not great at reading others' feelings at the best of times, and when it’s a feeling I quite literally haven’t experienced, it’s extremely difficult to navigate.  It’s blindsighted me a few times in the past with other people and I just haven’t caught on yet.    

I explained myself.  We talked through it.  I said I'd probably never even be in a relationship at all, and that I wasn;t intersted in that sort of relationship with him.  I thought he understood, and things seemed normal.  He seemed to treat me the same as he treated everyone else in the group.  I thought it was over and never really thought about it again.  I tried to read between all the lines of what he was saying, and I never caught anything that seemed too off.  

A few months ago, he offhandedly mentioned getting an apartment together at some point.  He’s lived with a couple people in the friend group at this point, people he's had no interest in, so it didn’t raise any red flags to me.  The job market in the area is in shambles, so it was practical.  It was vague, and felt more like coming up with future plans on the playground as a kid than anything concrete.  I don't remember exactly what I said, but I do remember it was affirmative but noncommittal, something like “yeah, maybe”.  I remember bringing up how expensive rent is, and then the subject changed.  It was never brought up again.  

So here’s where I fucked up today.  

We went to our local games shop together to buy dice.  It was the first time hanging out one-on-one in *ages (*it hadn't really happened much in the past year, due to a combination of our slightly uncomfortable conversation and senior year school work).  We were just hanging out and talking, walking around the store making jokes.  It felt like it used to.  

We commiserated over job hunting.  I brought up the horrid state of the job market, especially in my field.  I noticed he was being extremely supportive, almost sickly sweet in how kind he was about assuring me that things would be fine.  I started to get a pit in my stomach, it was so genuine. 

Dread churning inside, me I tried to continue the conversation, mentioning probably having to be in a big city like New York or San Francisco, both of which are well over 1000 miles from where we live.  

And then he hits me with “Well, when we move in together, wherever that is, I can finally start looking for a job there.”

I pushed a little, and he expressed that he wasn’t joking.  He was genuinely planning on moving to wherever I get a job in my field to live with me.  He said that he loves supporting me and what I do.  I kind of shut down after that.  I couldn’t find the words.  He's lived in this region his entire life.  He's never lived away from his parents.  He's never had a job in his life.  

He said if pay was tight, he could probably pay for it (via his parents), that he would do anything for me.  He even made a comment about how we should get one of the tapestries in the store for the hypothetical apartment, like he could already picture the space in his head.  It seemed like months of his repressed feelings spilling out in the middle of the store.  I left pretty soon after.

Damn my complete lack of social awareness and willingness to believe he'd gotten over it.  And damn did I fuck up because I have no idea how to navigate this one, I’ve just been staring at my computer screen since.  Adrien sent me a meme a little while ago, just the sort of message that is normal and doesn't allign with the closeness of what he said earlier.  I feel like I can’t talk to him right now, and I regret not telling him that that’s insane while I was in the moment.  I regret hanging out with him at all today. 

TLDR: Took a friend at face value when he said he was no longer romantically interested in me and started hanging out with him again, only to find out he’s literally willing to pack up and move to wherever I am to be with me.  I shut down and probably made it worse by not turning him down in the moment.  ",t2_10nhju5s8w,False,,0,False,TIFU by hanging out with a friend who's in love with me ,[],r/tifu,False,7,L,0,,False,t3_1g2inbg,False,light,0.79,,public,160,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},L,False,160,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,2024-10-13 05:24:23,text,7,,,text,self.tifu,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIFU by hanging out with a friend who&amp;#39;s in love with me &lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"It has been an interesting day, but I figured it would help me to let out an update on the whole situation involving me getting high while my friend's wife got drunk. In case you missed it, [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1g1sif3/tifu_by_letting_my_friend_watch_his_wife_get/) is the original post.

I spoke to Fiona, my wife, about the whole situation, and she agreed with me- though a lot of what happened was no fault of my own, this type of situation shouldn't be repeated. I think what helped is that I emphasized how uncomfortable the whole situation made me feel, and I was as honest as I could be with her (leaving out the worst of it in order to not make things awkward). Fiona realizes that I didn't go in with this scenario in mind, and there wasn't exactly a safe way for me to exit the situation without souring my friendship with Garth and Cheri in some way. Fiona and I made the agreement that if I repeat such an event with Cheri, there's going to be at least one other friend present (whether said third friend is sober, drunk, or tripping, was not specified).

I also reached out to Garth, my friend, and apologized for any discomfort I may have caused him, and I told him that I wasn't intending to repeat such an incident again. That I felt like I had disrespected him in his own home. He responded to me along these lines, ""*It's alright, it's not your fault, we are good. I know who's fault it is.*"" Which is a bit cryptic but I decided to leave it at that, because if Garth says we're cool, I don't want to make it uncool by digging any deeper. We have Burning Wheel night this week, so I'll be able to gauge how things are between us at that point.

I then contacted Cheri, Garth's wife, just to confirm how she felt about the situation, and to confirm with her that Garth was ok with it. She cheerfully responded, ""Oh, he was a bit grumpy, but that's just because he thinks those movies are super dumb."" She then casually suggested that next time we do it it should just be the two of us on a night when Garth is going out, ""So that he doesn't get grumpy about the movies,"" and that she wants to hit 5 drinks next time. I then told her that I would prefer to have another person there, and she was like, ""Hmm. Have it your way I guess."" So I don't know. I'm flattered that Cheri wants to spend quality time with me. But I also have no desire to be in a situation where my mind is inebriated and imagining horrifically awkward social vibes, even if those vibes aren't there from anyone else's perspective.

TL;DR After my awkward evening where I was high and my friend's wife was drunk, I unpacked everything. My wife and I made agreements that I won't be alone with her again.

,tifu,"TIFU by exposing my chest to my friend after rejecting him

Today, a family friend and i decided to explore an abandoned school in our city. It’s important to note that me and this friend don’t know eachother nor see eachother very often, were basically situational friends that hang out when our parents decided to see eachother. Today we decided to hang out one on one for the first time as it turned out we were both into lost places/urban exploring. 

To get into this building, we had to jump a pretty tall metal fence, and since i am quite short i needed him to jump it first so he can help me get down from the other side. (This is important). 

Once we get in, we start exploring, this building was very big so we spent about 2h going around until we got to the basement where we sat down in a little nook. There, he started to get physically close to me (not something he’s ever done before) and started asking me romantic and sexual questions about relationships and my sex life etc. etc. until he confessed and asked if he could kiss me. I said no. He then attempted to persuade me by saying that it’s ""just a kiss"" and that i should ""loosen up"" and stop ""taking life too seriously"" (average teenage boy speech). I repeatedly said no and that im not interested in him like that. He then got a little upset and refuses to get up since he knew i was dependent on him to get out due to the fence situation, this made me very uncomfortable and scared to where i basically begged him to start going as it was getting late and cold.

this is where i fucked up:
once we make it out the window and by the fence, he jumps over first so he can help me down. It’s important to note that it’s a metal fence where the metal doesn’t stick out the same way on both sides, so it was much more difficult to get out than to get in.

&lt;p&gt;Today, a family friend and i decided to explore an abandoned school in our city. It’s important to note that me and this friend don’t know eachother nor see eachother very often, were basically situational friends that hang out when our parents decided to see eachother. Today we decided to hang out one on one for the first time as it turned out we were both into lost places/urban exploring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get into this building, we had to jump a pretty tall metal fence, and since i am quite short i needed him to jump it first so he can help me get down from the other side. (This is important). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we get in, we start exploring, this building was very big so we spent about 2h going around until we got to the basement where we sat down in a little nook. There, he started to get physically close to me (not something he’s ever done before) and started asking me romantic and sexual questions about relationships and my sex life etc. etc. until he confessed and asked if he could kiss me. I said no. He then attempted to persuade me by saying that it’s &amp;quot;just a kiss&amp;quot; and that i should &amp;quot;loosen up&amp;quot; and stop &amp;quot;taking life too seriously&amp;quot; (average teenage boy speech). I repeatedly said no and that im not interested in him like that. He then got a little upset and refuses to get up since he knew i was dependent on him to get out due to the fence situation, this made me very uncomfortable and scared to where i basically begged him to start going as it was getting late and cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is where i fucked up:
once we make it out the window and by the fence, he jumps over first so he can help me down. It’s important to note that it’s a metal fence where the metal doesn’t stick out the same way on both sides, so it was much more difficult to get out than to get in. Once he makes it over, i start climbing up but keep slipping, once im almost finally at the top, my shirt gets caught on a piece of the metal that’s sticking out on the top and i slip with an almost cartoonish ripping sound, leaving me hanging to the fence by my shirt and bra that are now only around my neck with my whole upper body exposed while this dude just stares from across the fence. i proceed to struggle for a few seconds while this dude STANDS AND LAUGHS until i give up and slip out of my shirt and bra completely, leaving me completely shirtless in a german FALL at night, while he just stands on the opposite side of the fence staring and kind of laughing.

,tifu,"Had a rare night out in DTLA to me friends from my hometown. I paid $25 for 2.5 hours at a lot next to the brewery, truly thinking I wasn’t going to stay out past that. 
Then I started drinking and having fun, another friend shows up, and just lost track of time. 
When I finally start walking to the parking lot at 12:45am, I remember my mistake and brace myself, expecting to see a hefty ticket on my windshield. 

Nope. My car was gone. I panic, look around and can’t find the tow truck name or phone number posted anywhere. I call the parking lot number and they direct me to where I need to go. 

Thankfully, my friend was with me and  drives me less than 2 miles to the impound lot and I’m told it’s going to cost $512 to get it back. I almost fall to my knees. 

My ticket says it expired at 10:21 PM and the form they gave me says my car was towed at 11:42 PM but the “day held in impound” says 2 days… how it makes sense is beyond me. 

Instead of paying $5 for the extra 2 hours, it ended up costing me $512. Lesson learned. I hate DTLA.

TL;DR: didn’t pay for the right amount of parking, had to pay $512 for towed car.

,tifu,"Hello everyone! I've read lots of posts about what to do post-break-up to avoid unnecessary hurt to either yourself or your ex partner. I wanted more specific advice as I've been confused about how to handle this situation so here goes..

I dated my partner for 8 months. We had a break after 3 months as I struggled to maintain the relationship after frequent break up conversations. Our communication improved when we got back together but I felt numb and strange a couple months into being together again. There is a lot of love there but I decided to ask for a break as I am moving home for two months and didn't want to ruin the relationship with long-distance as we had spoken about how it wouldn't work for us.

After going on a break for a few days, we ended up breaking up instead as the break didn't have a clear end. It was hard to process as I wanted to keep making the relationship work but I felt I needed the space to understand why I wasn't feeling myself for these past months. I had definitely been neglecting my self-care and my own friends and family. I thought my issues with anxiety and deperssion were also affecting how I felt in the relationship.

Due to the nature of our break up and neither side wanting it to end, we have remained friends and continued to nurture a relationship with one another. We went a week where we weren't speaking very much and it felt horrible. After that, we bumped into each other, had an awkward encounter then agreed to spend time together to see if it was a relationship worth continuing. Then we slept together.

After a lot of talks, we have agreed that we want to stay close while letting each other explore our personal roads to peace and contentment, whatever form this takes. I want to ask yous, how do you know when to stop being friends? The relationship wasn't bad in any way, I just felt something missing for myself and I can identify clearly why I felt that way. Now I'm going home for two months, I want to spend as much time with him appreciating our connection rather than fighting the urge to spend time with him, making myself even more miserable. But I also know that trying to keep our relationship immediately could be severing our future connection to each other.

,tifu,"Last year, I took on the project of digitizing all our old family photos from 1986 to around 2005, when we switched to digital cameras. I bought a special photo scanner, and even with that, it took me about a week to scan all 4000 photos. I meticulously organized them, added metadata, and made sure everything was clean and easy to navigate. I felt pretty proud of the work I had done, but after a few weeks, I needed a break from it.

Today, I decided it was finally time to finish sorting and tagging the photos so I could start assembling photo books for Christmas. I had this plan to make photo books with the most important pictures for my sister, my parents, and myself. But when I went looking through my hard drives, I couldn’t find a single photo. It got worse—because we're in the middle of moving, we threw out the originals, and I was sure I had them backed up. I thought I had them saved in two places. Turns out, I didn’t. I know about the 3-2-1 backup rule and planned to do it properly once I was done, but now... I feel absolutely worthless.

I called my parents to tell them, and I broke down in tears. They were worried at first and thought something much worse had happened. When they realized it was ""just"" the photos, they were relieved we were all okay. But I still feel like complete shit.

It's hard to put into words how much those photos meant. They captured years of memories, family gatherings, and moments that are just... gone now. I guess this is a lesson in not putting things off, but it still feels like a punch in the gut.

&lt;p&gt;My crossfaded mind thought it would be hilarious to see the horse dildo (unrelated but it’s huge btw) one that I found on a gimp suit. A horse one specifically. Like from family guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem is, I forgot the word for dildo. But I remembered the word cock. And being the naive teenager I was I went to Google images and was instantly sobered up from the shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: was 19, got crossfaded for the first time in college, accidentally stumbled across b**stiality porn&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"\[*Trigger Warning - Alcohol and Drug use*\] Alright so this whole ordeal just took place over the past several hours, and I'm still reeling. I'm writing this out to try to help me process what the fuck happened.

For some context- I (29M) am married. My friends relevant to this situation, Garth (29M) and Cheri (24F), are married to each other. Garth and I are good friends and we play Burning Wheel and other such TTRPGs together with a group of guys. Cheri and I are also quite close and we share a lot of similar interests. We're both creative, like art and gaming, etc, there's just a lot that makes us click in ways that Garth and I don't. And that's fine. We're all friends and it seems to be all good.

One day Cheri and I were messaging as we often do, and she suggested a ""fun night idea"" to me, namely, that she gets drunk and I trip out on mushrooms, and we do it together while watching a few dumb movies. In and of itself, that sounded hilarious and I thought it would be pretty fun. I'm not a drinker, I had never even been around someone who had been drunk before. Cheri likes her drinks but had only seen me dose mushrooms once before on a very low dose. I guess she was curious about us being together while under the influence, and I can't deny that I felt an inexplicable desire to investigate such an experience as well. So it seemed like a good plan and we made the arrangements.

I decided to be honest with my wife, Fiona, about our plans. She was hesitant at first. There's been awkward moments between the four of us as couples before (although lines were never truly crossed), so I don't blame her. But after I made it clear that Garth would be there, she was ok with it and told me simply to tell her how it went afterward. Well, let's start by saying, ""*it went.*"" **Cue a long string of awkward fuckups that would last the entire evening.**

The first fuckup was that when I showed up, Garth wasn't home. It was only me and Cheri. She'd just put her kids to bed 30min before, and Garth was working late apparently. Which felt a little bit awkward, being alone with her, but I shrugged it off since she seemed so innocuous and nonchalant about it. I took my mushrooms and she had her first drink of the evening, and we put on a movie of her choosing which we had both agreed would probably be funny and dumb. Cheri had rearranged their living room so that the 2-seater loveseat was facing the TV instead of the normal 3-seater couch. I don't know if she did it just for that day or if it had been like that all week, since the last time I had been there they'd had the 3-seater couch across from the TV and the loveseat off to one side. This meant that we were sitting closer together. As the shrooms kicked in, every time she'd speak to me and I would turn to her I would see her hair floating up a bit like waves of reddish-orange and her skin was taking on an undeniably attractive hue. These effects are par for the course though so I wasn't concerned about that.

I was peaking on the trip by the time she was starting her third drink. I don't know alcohol because I don't drink, and in my current state I was unable to discern whether she was playing up the alcohol or if she is just a lightweight. She kept giggling and laughing, leaning on me and touching me a lot. Meanwhile I was really struggling to 'zen' through this; it was like I realized there was a disconnect between our sources of inebriation. Cheri asked me to feel her hair because she saw I was staring at it and I had explained to her what it looked like visually. It felt really soft and nice. My serotonin receptors were going off like mad and in my mind, it felt like I had never seen a more beautiful and lovely person in my life. I told Cheri this, and it made her laugh uproariously and pretty much fall on top of me from laughter. She remained physically close and leaning against me for a while, and in my psychological state it felt like her body was melting into mine.

Garth came home just as Cheri had cracked open her fourth drink. She happily got up and kissed him at the door. I said Hello, and he acknowledged me and went straight to the shower. I'm not sure how long he was in there, but the time dilation made it feel so long that I had completely forgotten he was even in the house by the time he came out. It was just me and Cheri being silly and watching a dumb movie. When Garth came out, he sat on the 3-seater couch by himself and was eating a meal Cheri had made earlier. He then made some kind of complaint about the meal, which she dismissed nonchalantly, and it was at that very moment that I started feeling awkward. Suddenly, I couldn't shake this idea that it was like he was watching me have a date with his wife, and going farther, right in front of him. Cheri didn't change her physical behavior much, despite his presence, except to stop leaning against me as profusely she had been. She also mentioned, right in front of Garth, that this was ""the drunkest she had been in a long time.""

From my time-dilated perspective, it felt like YEARS for Cheri to finish her fourth drink. And the whole time, Garth sat off to the side, on his phone. In my mental state, I couldn't stop thinking that he was *furious* at us. Cheri tried to involve him in conversation several times but he kind of ignored her, and I think the only thing I directly recall him saying was, ""This movie is the stupidest shit ever."" Eventually Garth left the room for the evening and I didn't see him again. Cheri continued her drunken shenanigans and a lot of physical contact. As I was coming down from the trip she started eating a lot of pretzels and drinking a lot of water, which she explained to me was to make sure she wouldn't be so hung over the next day.

We spent about half an hour in deeper conversation after we were both done our respective substances. Cheri seemed completely happy with the whole experience and I couldn't sense any awkwardness from her. She happily talked about how we can do it next time, and agreed that she'd pound a drink back shortly before I arrived so that we'd be synchronized at our respective ""intoxication"" points. But I felt awkward as FUCK. I left their house feeling like I'd had emotional &amp; psychological sex with my friend's wife right in front of him. I told Fiona when I got home that I had to ""process"" the whole experience before I could articulate to her what it was like. She's curious but not overly concerned, but I'm not sure how she'll feel after I explain what happened. And now here I am, trying myself to process what actually happened, where things went wrong, and how the fuck I'm going to share all this with Fiona (or which parts I omit).

,tifu,"Okay, so this all just happened the other night. I met this girl on a dating app, and surprisingly, found out very quickly we were extremely compatible. Conversation came super easy, and we quickly exchanged numbers and called each other up to chat every night for the next week whole I was out of state on vacation. We had an insane amount of similarities, including an obsession with true crime podcasts, serial killers, etc. One difference we did have was horror flicks. She told me she gets scared easily. I, on the other hand, absolutely love horror flicks. This is an important detail, or so I believe it is... 

Anyway, fast forward a few days and I am back in my home state, and we decide to meet up for dinner and a walk around the lake by my place. We meet up and have dinner, and the conversation somehow lands back on serial killers and horror films. We go into detail about some of our most memorable cases we've followed, dinner finishes up, and I pay the bill and ask if she's still up for a walk. She says yes. Mind you, it's gotten dark by this point. 

We both drove our own cars, so I told her to follow me as I jumped into my car. I punched in the name of the lake in my gp, and away we went. The drive was only about 10 minutes, but I didn't really seem to remember ever going this way. The roads got darker, streetlights became sparse, and I had to take multiple turns. I was really starting to doubt this route, and as I looked in the rearview, I saw she was following from further behind. At this point, I figured it was best for me to call her and tell her I think Google maps was jerking me around, so I pulled over on the side of the road, looked more closely at maps, and decided to call her, as she was stopped about a half block behind me. As the phone rang, I saw her flip the car around and speed off on the opposite direction. She never answered, and after letting the whole thing sink in, I drove home, opened my dating app to see she also blocked me. 

Then it dawned on me that I am an absolute idiot, and that talking about my favorite serial killers with a woman who is easily spooked, then leading her to the middle of nowhere was probably just about the worst first date idea ever. I'm bummed, and I feel awful for scaring the shit out of her, but I guess I just have to laugh it off at this point, I don't think I'll be hearing from her again. 

Next time I'll just go to a damned coffee shop like a NOT serial killer

I used it kind of like you would use ""Bye Felicia""...I actually thought I was telling people that I would see them later. Or like they were being annoying and wanted them to go away.

 A couple of weeks of saying that phrase later... I was told by my boss that I had said something very vulgar and that I would be getting a write up soon when an HR member was available. I was astonished. I am very southern and sometimes I just let things slip casually.

This week I learned that ""See you next Tuesday"" was actually code for calling someone a cunt. A word I never use. It's very disrespectful.

The entire time I just cannot remember what I would have said that would garnish a final warning but I agreed to sign the paper and understood that if I had said something vulgar then yea I should be written up.

,tifu,"This happened about five minutes ago. My cousins and I (18F) are at a condo, and we were getting back from the pool. I was taking a nighty-night shower, as one does, but wanted it to be quick, ergo, I didn’t play any music so I wouldn’t get distracted and take too long. 

Because I had no music, I decided to: “Might as well just sing myself”
So I sing the whole duration of a 10-15 minute shower. Not too embarrassing, right?
Wrong.

Turns out, I was heard the WHOLE time by my cousins, in two DIFFERENT rooms.

Still not too bad, right?

Also wrong.

I wasn’t singing anything cool, like Chappell Roan, or Lana Del Ray. I wasn’t even something slightly embarrassing like AJR or Imagine Dragons.

Heck, I wish I was singing Thick of It

Nope. I was singing Plant Island from My Singing Monsters. Kill me now.

,tifu,"Ok so this happened about two hours ago and I don't have anyone to talk about it so I decided to post here. English is not my fist language and I am still shaking from what happened so I apologise for any mistakes.

I (20m) got my driver's license about 5 months ago but since I don't own a car I almost never used it. I would occasionally take my dad's car to drive very short distances but that was it. However, I still felt pretty confident until today. I had already noticed a problem in the car where, if it is on a slope facing down and I put it on reverse, it will still move forwards when I take my foot out of the brake pedal, which means I have to quickly press on the accelerator for it to go backwards and stop moving forwards. However since it only happened one time I thought maybe it wasn't that big of an issue specially because I never used the car (BIG mistake). Today my dad told me to park the car inside of the garage because it was parked in front of my house, which is on a slope, and there was a delivery van parked right in front of it. So I got in the car, and turned it on, except it didn't turn on, only the panel lit up, not the engine. As I said, since I don't usually use the car, this hadn't happened a lot of times before, and most importantly not on a slope. Then, the guy who was doing the deliveries with the van told me to back up, I was already going to so I proceded with him in front of the car. As soon as I took the car out of parking mode and on reverse, it started to move forwards, but when I pressed on the accelerator for it to go backwards, the car continued to move forwards. I quickly slammed the brakes but since the engine was off the brake pedals were really stiff and didn't make the car stop fast enough to avoid hitting the poor dude. His leg got stuck between his van and mine, and he was yelling for me to reverse because my car was still pressing against his leg. I swear to god, I was trying my hardest but I was so scared and desperate that I couldn't even process what was happening. Since the engine was off the only way to get the car to go backwards was to turn it on, but I was to scared that I couldn't even understand what was the isse. It got to a point where I left my car and went to his side and started to try and push it up the slope to free his leg (I know this is stupid as fuck but I had never been this desperate in my entire life). By a miracle some guy passing by the street saw what was happening, got in my car and was able to turn it on and reverse it. When his leg finally became unstuck, I immediately collapsed to the ground shaking. I kept apologizing to the guy and he was surprisingly chill about all of it. I thought his leg would have at least broken but he was able to stand and walk, he just said it was hurting like a mf. I offered to take him to the hospital a million times but he said it was fine. I gave him my number so that I can pay for his medical expenses but it still didn't feel like enough, idk I was expecting him to freak out on me (which would have been 100% understandable) but he accepted my apologies imediately. I didn't even know how to feel. I am feeling guilty as fuck and, to be honest, I fully deserve it. Imagine if there was a kid in front of the car, I'm shaking just by imagining that. I guess I won't be driving for a long time. 

TL;DR: I (20M) rarely drive and had an accident today while trying to reverse my dad's car on a slope. The engine was off, causing the brakes to stiffen, and the car moved forward, trapping a delivery man's leg between my car and his van. Thankfully, a passerby helped turn the car on to reverse, and the delivery man wasn’t seriously injured, but I feel extremely guilty and won’t be driving for a while.

,tifu,"TL;DR - started new job a little under a month, took muscle relaxants before work, my body started feeling weird, remembered I took muscle relaxants before work, embarrassed while telling my manager, sent me home for the day, afraid I might lose my job.

a little under a month ago I started a job at UPS here in my hometown, it hasn't been an easy job by any means, a lot of heavy lifting and a consistent workout while working there, but even then I've loved it so far! The problem started this morning, my mom had left some muscle relaxants in my room for anytime I felt sore from work, after working for a while I had gotten used to the burn of the job, but for whatever reason I decided to take the muscle relaxants before work.

When I got to work I started stacking boxes and doing the usual work you'd imagine UPS workers do (I guarantee you it's exactly what you think it is except with boxes that are between 20-100lb), until I started feeling the strength in my arms weakening, my legs were aching and my lower back would start feeling like it was squeezing together, it was a weird feeling. For a bit I tried powering through it assuming it was just me needing to fix my posture while I lift and using my legs more, but the feeling was growing more and more, then I remembered taking the muscle relaxants and realizing that my body was relaxing itself while I worked out.

To confirm my suspicions, I looked it up really quick on my phone and unfortunately, my mistake could've risked an injury and caused me to pull something a lot easier than usual. Embarrassed, I looked for a manager to tell them about my mistake, then they asked me a few questions to confirm that I wasn't BSing them until they decided that i should go home. Naturally, I would be okay with going home, but I felt so stupid having to leave my job not even 30 minutes before it even started because of my lack of knowledge on the appropriate time to take muscle relaxants. 

The only reason I felt like sharing this in this subreddit is because I'm afraid of losing this job that I frankly fell in love with because of a stupid slip up, I also think I have a greater chance of getting fired because I'm still in the probation stage of my job, not that this has happened before, but I think this might be plenty of reason to let me go. At the same time, I didn't want to risk an injury and make myself a liability to them because of this.

,tifu,"Today I fucked up by taking a nap with an earbud in. I did not mean to take a nap, nor did I mean to leave an earbud in. But I was exhausted from my closing shift at work last night. I was watching last week tonight when I fell asleep. When I woke up, my phone was off, on the ground next to the couch, and I had a horrible pain in my left ear. As I sat up, I looked down to see my earbud fall into my lap. The silicone part that sits in the ear was missing. 

This was my first sign.

I stood up, putting the earbud itself back in the charging case. I looked around for the silicone part, but I couldn’t find it. At the same time, I stuck a pinky in my left ear to try and figure out why it hurt so much. I couldn’t feel anything at first. But then my finger nudged something. I froze. I ran stumbling to the bathroom, panicking about what I could do.

I couldn’t see anything. Of course I couldn’t, it’s in my fucking ear. I ran back to grab my phone hoping I could take a picture and see for sure. After a could attempts, sure enough there’s the fucking silicone tip, lodged in my goddamn ear.

I can’t afford to go to the emergency room. What the hell am I gonna do. I can’t ask anyone for help, that would be so incredibly embarrassing I would rather light myself on fire.

I’d have to get it out myself. I couldn’t reach it with must my fingers. Next I tried using needle nose pliers. That did not work. Finally, I tried using a pair of tweezers. I was able to get a hold of the damn thing, and it was the most uncomfortable sensation I have ever felt. I watched the mirror as it slid out of my ear, covered in a fair amount of earwax.

I washed it off in the sink, resolving to never again think about it, and to never fall asleep with an earbud in again. (I will likely do it again within the week)

,tifu,"Yesterday 10/10/24 around 3pm I had just finished cleaning up my property and getting my generator hooked up after the hurricane. I had planned on flying my drone to get a good view of the damage around my neighborhood. I tried to open my DJl app but the app needed to update. I let the update begin but my cell signal was really weak and was taking forever to update. I decided to get in my truck and look for a stronger signal.
I pulled into a Circle K gas station down the street where the signal was strong. It was completely closed no vehicles on the property.. the 20+ pump guns were zip-tied and the store was empty.

,tifu,"No, it is not a euphemism for some kind of street drug. I literally mean ice-cream. 🍦

I am a SUPER-introvert who rarely leaves the house, but today I decided to treat myself by going to the fancy ice cream place by the beach. I bought an ice-cream cone, put my headphones on, and went to sit outside on the bench. Somehow I managed to inhale some as I was eating it, and started coughing/trying to breathe so hard that I got hypoxia and passed out. 

I clearly fell off the bench, because I woke up very confused with a bleeding lip, a mouth full of dirt, and ice-cream all over my face and glasses, surrounded by concerned strangers. This was, obviously, INCREDIBLY embarrassing, but they were all very nice to me. MVP goes to the lady with the baby stroller who gave me sooo many baby wipes to wipe all the dirt and blood and ice-cream off my face. I will remember you always; you are the GOAT ❤️

Besides having to run the ABSOLUTE GAUNTLET of social anxiety, I also scratched the left lens of my glasses, which suuuuuuucks because I'm still paying for this pair in installments, and November was gonna be my last payment 😭 Hopefully maybe the optometrist can just polish out the scratches or something. I'm never going out in public again 😂

TL;DR: Ice-cream is for swallowing, not breathing. 

ACTUAL TL;DR: Inhaled while eating an ice-cream cone, coughed so hard that I fainted in public in front of strangers and broke my very expensive glasses

EDIT: OMG this actually reminded me of another dumb story 😂 I once was in the kitchen when I started choking (not inhaling this time, actual choking) on a piece of carrot, so I stumbled into my spouse's room thinking he was going to save me with the Heimlich maneuver. In reality, he is used to me wandering in there while he is gaming, so since I didn't say anything (because choking) he just kept playing League of Legends 😂 Tbf if I had reached the chair and grabbed him by the shoulder he definitely would have realised there was something wrong, but I managed to dislodge the carrot just before I got to his desk.

It actually lead to a funny habit we have now, where if one of us needs attention and affection we sometimes go to the other and very dramatically pretend to swoon while saying ""OMG I'm LItEraLly DyINg and you don't even notice meeeee!"" I love this human so much 🥰

I literally mean ice-cream. 🍦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a SUPER-introvert who rarely leaves the house, but today I decided to treat myself by going to the fancy ice cream place by the beach. I bought an ice-cream cone, put my headphones on, and went to sit outside on the bench. Somehow I managed to inhale some as I was eating it, and started coughing/trying to breathe so hard that I got hypoxia and passed out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I clearly fell off the bench, because I woke up very confused with a bleeding lip, a mouth full of dirt, and ice-cream all over my face and glasses, surrounded by concerned strangers. This was, obviously, INCREDIBLY embarrassing, but they were all very nice to me. MVP goes to the lady with the baby stroller who gave me sooo many baby wipes to wipe all the dirt and blood and ice-cream off my face. I will remember you always; you are the GOAT ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides having to run the ABSOLUTE GAUNTLET of social anxiety, I also scratched the left lens of my glasses, which suuuuuuucks because I&amp;#39;m still paying for this pair in installments, and November was gonna be my last payment 😭 Hopefully maybe the optometrist can just polish out the scratches or something. I&amp;#39;m never going out in public again 😂&lt;/p&gt;

We used to banter a lot and give light jabs on our choice of words. But i really loved to talk to her. We helped each other on problems we faced in our games. It was awesome. For the record we've never met in person. I even gave her access to my ps account since she had a smaller library of games.
So anyways, today we were discussing about the current weather and stuff and i mentioned being careful while walking to places. And i mentioned i would offer to drop her off everywhere in a playful way, but she probably thought i was being creepy and blocked me everywhere. I honestly didn't mean any harm. But oh well.

For anybody who doesn't know or dwells under a conch, Meeseeks are characters in Rick and Morty who once summoned (at a press of a botton on the box) will do anything you ask. They are blue, non-gendered and obviously cartoonist in design.

In my research therefore I headed to work and proceeded to Google ""Meeseeks Porn."" The research appeared promising so I opened a couple of tabs to look.

,tifu,"I own a Philips One Blade razor which I used for years. It’s a versatile product but the blade are expensive and the shave never really satisfied me.

In May I decided to switch back to using a safety razor. I used to own one that I very stupidly got rid of it. I used to really like the close shave I could get with it but it took too much time.

This old safety razor was a “butterfly” one. Twist the handle, top part opens, insert the blade, twist the handle in the other direction and you’re good to go.

The new safety razor instead has two plates that you screw on top of each on the handle. Now that where my issue was. The middle plate seemed to have been a poor design choice, I mean what did I really expect from a relatively cheap product. 

When a while blade is secured it just doesn’t cut, too much of the metal plate is still sticking out, the edge of the blade is too far from the skin . A whole blade was just not working. 

My solution was to cut the blade in half and secure it just close enough to the edge so I could get it to actually shave. I bought half blades so I didn’t even have to cut the blade in half. Sometimes it works, most time it was a messy shave.

Until last night. 

I wasn’t planning to shave but I was listening to a good podcast, the flow was good, I find shaving relaxing, why not I said. 

I used one of the original blades again. It just didn’t sit right with me that it didn’t work, but once again it just didn’t seem to shave. I look at the blade, I look at the box, I look at the razor. What if? What if the middle plate was upside down?

Well yes it was. Turns out you can screw the middle plate upside down and it sort of look correct but it’s very much not. And it made the safety razor very unsafe, probably. Don’t try it at home. 

TL;DR - I used a safety razor with the middle plate screwed upside down for the last six months. Don’t try it at home.

&lt;p&gt;This old safety razor was a “butterfly” one. Twist the handle, top part opens, insert the blade, twist the handle in the other direction and you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new safety razor instead has two plates that you screw on top of each on the handle. Now that where my issue was. The middle plate seemed to have been a poor design choice, I mean what did I really expect from a relatively cheap product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a while blade is secured it just doesn’t cut, too much of the metal plate is still sticking out, the edge of the blade is too far from the skin . A whole blade was just not working. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solution was to cut the blade in half and secure it just close enough to the edge so I could get it to actually shave. I bought half blades so I didn’t even have to cut the blade in half. Sometimes it works, most time it was a messy shave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until last night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t planning to shave but I was listening to a good podcast, the flow was good, I find shaving relaxing, why not I said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used one of the original blades again. It just didn’t sit right with me that it didn’t work, but once again it just didn’t seem to shave. I look at the blade, I look at the box, I look at the razor. What if? What if the middle plate was upside down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well yes it was. Turns out you can screw the middle plate upside down and it sort of look correct but it’s very much not. And it made the safety razor very unsafe, probably. Don’t try it at home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - I used a safety razor with the middle plate screwed upside down for the last six months. Don’t try it at home. &lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"Obligatory note that it was actually the day before yesterday.

Anyway, I decided that now my out of stock pills had at last arrived, I’d get everything put into my [Really Very Useful Pill Container](https://amzn.eu/d/8HF6klr). It sorts them by day and by AM and PM, and keeps them in little separate compartments so that I can just grab the days I need and take them with me if I’m not going to be home. It’s a much better system than having to rummage in my big pill storage box every day,  trying to make sure I get the quantities right, and trying to remember if I did take my morning pills already or not.

I sat in bed that evening and went through everything in the rummage box. I popped each pill out into a little bowl, one type at a time, in the exact quantity I needed, and then put them all into the right containers. The next morning I took it downstairs, and put it back on the side table by the sofa, which is a place where the cats are much less likely to push it onto the floor, I’ve found. 

I was so pleased with myself that I went and made myself an almost proper breakfast/brunch, and then did some reading for a nice change. I was definitely starting to feel more like myself after a hard few months, along with my ongoing health conditions. But I still managed to do a bit of cleaning in the kitchen that afternoon, and treated myself to a nice ready meal curry for tea.

I even managed to go to bed early, and got on with some more reading. It was only as I was settling down that I realised I’d not taken my pills. Not only that, I’d not taken my morning pills either. I can’t easily manage to go up and down stairs twice without a bit of time in between, so I decided to read a bit more, then I’d go down and get them. 

Big mistake.

Of course I fell asleep, and didn’t wake up until late the next morning. My cats actually woke me up, which they never do (they’d rather stay in bed where it’s warm). But I was so grateful to them, because I was having the worst nightmare I can ever remember, and that last thing I recall from it was desperately trying to scream, but not being able to. I was in a complete state of panic when I woke up, and overwhelmed with anxiety like I haven’t felt in years. It was horrible. Everything around me looked wrong, and I felt almost completely disconnected from reality. I was shaky and dizzy, and it felt like the walls were moving, and gravity wasn't working right. I managed to very carefully get downstairs, take my morning dose for that day, and then took the evening pills upstairs with me, with a bag of of salty/sweet popcorn, some Maltesers and a big drink. Then I went back to bed, and eventually felt ok enough to sleep again - happily with no more dreams.

I know that I *do* dream: I must. Everyone does. But it’s extremely rare that I remember doing so, or anything more than vague impressions and snatches of feelings. No visual mind and no visual memory doesn’t help with recall. But I know that if I miss one type of my pills, I will suddenly start having really vivid and complex dreams. That plus missing my anxiety meds and anti-migraine pills made for a bit of a perfect storm.

So remember kids, trying to be organised only causes trouble…

Tl;dr: I was very pleased with myself for getting my pills sorted out into my organiser at last. But then I forgot that they were in a new place, and managed to miss two doses on the run, leading to a horrible, literal nightmare and anxiety that took me a whole day to recover from.

,tifu,"So a couple of weeks ago I had this weird dream, which was mostly normal, except that it was a sort of sex dream(?) I had about a childhood friend. Idk if it counts as that, I didn’t dream about actually having sex with him but rather I knew that we had in both dreams(I had two different dreams months apart). The first time I thought I could like him because at the time one of my friends had mentioned that he(the friend the dream was about) was basically my ideal type. I explained to her that while he did seem that way on the surface I had never thought of him in such a way in all the years I’ve known him, and that I guess I wasn’t as superficial as others think I am since the main reason I never thought of him that way is his personality. I can put up with it and find it funny as a friend, but it’s something I can’t get over. I also grew up with him(sort of) so I never found him attractive or anything.

Basically the first dream I had could be explained by me thinking I could like him after one of my friends mentioned he was my type and him being nicer to me at the time, though that could also be due to us just starting to hang out more then. Like a few days after that dream i remembered why I could never like him in a more than friends way. I think this recent dream was caused by one of our mutual friends liking him and talking about it while trying not to make it too obvious. I think it was because she kept saying things like “he’s actually so nice, caring, etc.”  anyways I told him about the dream, which I now realize was a mistake, and then we had a longer talk about dating(not each other just the topic) and about the guy I like and the type of people he would date and why. I specifically mentioned the guy I like because I wanted to make it clear to him that I don’t like him. He has known that I’ve liked that guy on and off for the past 4 years, so it’s not a surprise. 

Anyway, the reason I think he may think I like him is that he jokingly(?) asked if any protection was used and i then told him there was(that’s literally how I know what happened, like in the first dream he had one for some reason and in the second dream he was going to buy some and I was supposed to look for a hiding place from the others who were there with us). I also then told him that if it made him feel better, I didn’t actually remember us having sex, and I just knew it happened and he said in his sort of usual awkwardly sarcastic(?) tone “just stop it.” He then went on to ask if I knew about the mutual friend who liked him and I told him I did, which he followed up by saying he had a gut feeling as to her liking him and also what my dream was about but that he wished he was wrong both times, which is what led to the longer deeper conversation we had about dating in general. When I have seen him, things seem normal from an outside perspective, but I think that he thinks I could/do like him. 

TL;DR:
I had two weird dreams months apart about me dating a friend  and I told him about the dreams after I had the second dream a couple of days or weeks ago. Unfortunately, one of our mutual friends had just confessed to him, so we ended up having a longer deeper talk about dating in general, and I mentioned the guy I like to reassure my friend that I don’t have feelings towards him because I like someone already, but I think I messed things up between us by even mentioning the dreams and that he now thinks I like him.

,tifu,"Hi Reddit, I'm going to do my best to not make this sound like a gum advertisement or a sex novel hahah.  I've recently told this story to a friend who thought it was so funny and said I should write it down somewhere.  So obviously I thought Reddit would be perfect, I'm trying to start posting some of my crazy life stories on here.

So first I need to give some background about myself and my relationship with gum.  I (M28) have chronic tonsil stones.  For anyone who doesn't know, a tonsil stone is a little white ball that forms if a food particle gets stuck in your tonsils, and they smell like there's a rotten animal in the back of your throat.  I still remember coughing up my first one in elementary school music class and not knowing what it was, but I *still* remember it, and the smell.   Now that I am aware of this issue, I'm very self conscious about my breath and *always* have gum in my mouth.  I even got doctor notes to be able to chew gum where it's not allowed (like the school bus ect).  I've considered getting my tonsils removed but would rather not have a surgery for something that can be fixed with chewing gum.

Over the years, I have become a gum expert.  I know which brands smell the best and last the longest, and have come to discover the best gum for me.  I'm not sponsored, but I will say that my ideal flavor is Spearmint from a brand that has an space related name.  Now I ONLY chew this brand of gum because it lasts pretty long, and I've experienced other gums that either denigrate into almost a wet tissue type texture that has to be spit out immediately, and other brands that break up into tiny pieces after a certain amount of time.

One last detail is that although I *always* have this gum in my mouth, I don't chew it much, and it's usually just between my molars and cheek.  People have even pointed out that they can't tell I have gum in my mouth because I never actively chew it.  I'm also a gymnast and even do backflips with it in my mouth.

So now that you all think I'm that girl from Willy Wonka with the chewing gum, here's my fun TIFU story.  About 6 or 7 years ago I was visiting my college town and at the bar.  I sat next to a really handsome guy with a nice smile that I later learned was in the military.  I struck up a convo with him and he was telling me about how he was wearing his hat backwards to attract girls because douchey guys wear their hats backwards and girls like douchebags.  Then he pointed at one of my old college acquaintances walking out with a girl wearing his hat backwards, and said see?  I confirmed I actually knew that guy and he is a douche, he made fun of me for my hobby of insect photography.  Weird conversation but I entertained it because he was hot and maybe I had a chance?  I don't remember what else we spoke about that night, but that always stuck out to me lol.

At the end of the night he invited me back to his place which I thought was odd, because I thought he was straight.  At first I declined and said I'm staying with a friend less than a block away but he insisted so again I thought maybe I have a chance with this guy.  I shared my location with the friend I was staying with and while we were driving back to his place, he told me about how he was curious so I was like ""so you will cuddle with me tonight???""  And he said ""probably more ;)""

When we got back to his place he showered since he had been at some sort of military training for a few days, and then came back to the bedroom to hook up.  I asked him if he had gum (of course the one time I left the house without it), partially to clean the taste of White Gummy Bear Drinks from my mouth and partially because I recently heard somewhere that BJs feel better with minty gum and he handed me a brand that was not the Space Gum brand I like.  I immediately recognized that, but beggars can't be choosers right?

Now for the NSFW part.  We started hooking up and without being too vulgar, I made my with my mouth down from his neck to his chest to his beautiful abs to his dick.  After we finished hooking up, he turned the light on, looked in the mirror and said ""DUDE! WHAT THE FUCK!""

Well apparently it was one of those brands that breaks up into tiny pieces in my mouth, and he had little tiny pieces of gum stuck to his body hair.  He was blonde so he didn't have a lot of body hair, and I think he might have shaven too but it was so embarrassing to help him pick all these little pieces of gum off of him lol.

Other than that, it was a pretty good hook up and we stayed in touch and hooked up again but I'm not in to long distance relationships and he was still more interested in women.

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, it was a pretty good hook up and we stayed in touch and hooked up again but I&amp;#39;m not in to long distance relationships and he was still more interested in women.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"So, I was just recently hired by an HR company to do some IT/Marketing stuff, and I was pretty happy about it at first.

However, today I encountered a problem I may have overstepped some boundaries when trying to solve the problem.

The person at the front desk had some performance as well as hardware issues with their old Windows 7 machine and asked me to solve it. Once near the PC I tried unplugging and plugging the Ethernet cable, which blue-screened the PC. So, I thought to myself ""oh, just reinstall the network driver, easy peasy"". But then, when I uninstalled the driver, I rebooted the machine in order to check if it was completely gone, but by doing that I locked myself out of the PC.

This lock-thing happened because the account the lady was using was being stored on the server-side, not locally, which meant if I wanted to login to the PC I would need the username and password of the local account, which nobody, not even the IT company hired to do most of the computer stuff knew about. Without option, and since the lady needed the telephony app workig ASAP, I impulsively installed a Linux partition and tried emulating the software on Wine without asking for permission first.

For anyone knowledgeable about IT and Linux, this isn't much of a problem to fix if they do not desire the Linux OS anymore, but to the lady that was using the PC she probably thought I ""destroyed"" or permanently modified it beyond repair. The Windows 7 is still sitting there but like I said, you can't do jack squat without local admin username and password, and the company hired to do the IT part doesn't know or doesn't want to share this information. It also doesn't help that she has a very deep and intimidating voice. I am still anxious (heart-racing) and afraid of what will happen.

I was hired to do fix anything IT related and I did not want to appear incompetent and now I'm probably more screwed than ever. I really hope they see it the other way, because it would be embarrassing to be fired in just a short time.

He kind of recoiled, said ""uhhhh"", and then shuffled away awkwardly before I could explain anything.

(Outside of sending her this post to let her know I understand now).&lt;/p&gt;

It gets extremely hot so it can burn off the grease, but also got hot enough to not only melt the rack guards, but to turn them into an ash that completely coated the interior of the oven and is now chemically bonded to it. This is a picture after it cooled down. When it was hot it looked like the ashy aftermath of an atomic bomb. So, now I have to buy a whole new range before Thanksgiving.

For context: My boyfriend (26M) and I (24F) came back from a trip to Berlin last night and stayed at his brother's flat for convenience, because we both live pretty far from the airport, and commuting there at 12 am would have been tough. My boyfriend used to live in that flat some years ago while he was at university, so we’ve both spent a lot of time there. The flat is on the second floor with a view of a neighborhood courtyard where a community of stray cats lives. Whenever we used to cook, we would always look out the kitchen window to watch the cats.

Cut to midday today: I was making pasta for lunch when my boyfriend looked out the window. The blinds were halfway up, so while I, being 5'1"", could see a teenage girl in a school uniform walking through the courtyard, my 6'2"" boyfriend couldn’t. He did, however, spot an old calico cat sitting right below our window that he recognized. As the girl approached her door, my boyfriend started going ""pspspspspsps"" at the cat.

The girl started walking faster and turned her back to us when she reached her door, but my boyfriend kept going. I tried to make it clear that we were talking about the stray cat outside, but I’ve completely lost my voice from a cold I caught on the trip. So, from her perspective, what she probably heard was what sounded like a man and a chain-smoking whispering perv going ""pspspspsps"" at her, saying things like, “Wow, she’s still here, she’s so beautiful, probably 13 or 14 now.”

I was mortified. I backed away from the window and explained to my boyfriend that the girl probably thought we were talking to her. He said he only noticed her when she got to the door. I went back to the window, hoping to somehow make it clear we were talking about the cat, but my boyfriend didn’t get the hint and I couldn’t speak louder than a whisper, let alone yell out to clarify things to the girl (which would have been awkward anyway).

We backed away again and I explained the whole situation to my boyfriend—how she sped up, turned her back, and how all she could see from the outside was a dark window and not us. He seemed pretty unconcerned about the fact that we had, quite literally, cat-called a teenager. I feel so embarrassed and guilty because I know what it feels like for this kind of thing to happen. He later apologized to me, but I told him I’m not the one who needs the apology. My boyfriend really is a sweetheart, he's loving and respectful but a bit unaware sometimes. I don't think he gets the how scary it is sometimes to exist as a woman, I just wish I would have reacted faster to avoid the situation. 

I don’t think there’s anything we can do now that wouldn’t make the situation even more awkward, but I think I’m going to feel second-hand embarrassment from this forever.

For those who don't know the recipe, you sauté a huge bunch of onions and then add wine and broth. The thing is that it's a pain to sauté these onions: depending on the quantity, it can take an hour, you have to keep stirring otherwise the onions will burn while the rest doesn't caramelize. and there is a very specific moment when the onions are ready to add the liquids.

One day I got impatient and added the liquid too soon. It wasn't a problem with the taste. But you know... some people can react badly to onions that haven't caramelized yet. In the form of odor.

For two days I didn't leave the house. My breath, my poop, my pee, my sweat, me as a whole was stinking like the worst diarrhea  fart you've ever smelled in your life. A really strong smell! bathing only solved the problem for a few minutes. no one deserved to be around that stench.

,tifu,"Obligatory i'm on mobile so sorry about format. This TIFU happened about four hours ago. 
I'm currently on holiday in Bogota, which is beautiful, and like all tourists decided to head to one of the awesome free art museums. After looking around a couple of rooms, I start to feel a little tired from the walking, so I make a beeline for an empty bench. It's in the middle of the room, nothing around it, so I move closer. On inspection, it's a black bench with 5 shallow bowls on it. I think to myself; cool, they have funky benches here! With little bowl seats for each person on the bench! I move closer and notice that the bowls are balanced slighty on the bench - even better - it's a fun bench you can wobble the seats on! At this point, I reach out to wobble a seat... And then multiple things happen simultaneously. Firstly, the bowl makes a dull clanging thump as I push a side down towards the bench and I realise that it's made of some kind of glass and stone. Before I have the chance to make the connection that this is not normal bench material the screaming starts. As I look in the direction of the noise I realise its the security guard, screaming at me. Surprised, I look to the other group of tourists who are open mouthed looking at me in shock. At this point, I see that those tourists are sat on the other bench in the room - which is made of wood and very bench looking. It hits me that I am pushing on something incredibly expensive and old and important. I immediately let go of the bowl, and start apologising in my basic level Spanish, before almost running out of the door. 

I have no idea if I damaged the art and I'm so worried I'm going to end up on twitter/reddit as one of those awful CCTV people who damage art at museums. I am generally a very law abiding person and I am feeling so stressed about this. 

TLDR: a bench like piece of modern art in a national museum tricked me, and now i'm worried the colombian authorities are after me.

,tifu,"This was Sunday. I still feel awful.

Took a cab home to Brooklyn from Newark Airport, solo with my toddler. Late evening, end of a long tough day of traveling with the little one.

Cabbie was an incredibly sweet older man. He gave my daughter an apple. He complimented her “singing.” Said “G-d bless her.” Incredibly sweet old man. He mentioned he’d be going home after dropping us off because he’d had open heart surgery (!).

We live on a busy one-way street. There’s a fire hydrant in front of my building and a loading zone right on the corner of the block. Cabs usually drop off at one or the other. This was the first time since I moved to this building 3+ years ago that both of those spots have been occupied at the same time, and I’m getting in with luggage, a stroller, a very tired toddler in a car seat.

He pulls in at an odd angle (like the police precinct parking angle) to a non-spot on the other side of the street from my building. There’s a two-way bike lane between the parking on that side and the curb, bike lane gets a lot of e-bike traffic, not great for unloading. 

The fare comes to $143, not including tip. I hadn’t flown into Newark in forever, since back when it was around $100 for a cab back, so I wasn’t fully prepared for the price. “You can add the tip… So $200?” he jokes. It was a phone app, not like a card reader with a tip percent to select on it, and I wasn’t expecting to have to enter a total instead of the tip amount. I thought $40 would be a nice, really generous tip to give, since he’d been so kind to us. But my mouth accidentally said, “How about $193–I mean $183!” He was clearly annoyed and disappointed by the instant downgrade, so he goes, “How about $190?” I was annoyed because this was already way over budget, but my toddler was already starting to fuss and cry, seeing we were parked on our street and not getting out yet, and it was my own dumb fault for saying the wrong thing then walking it back, so I was like “Sure, that’s fine.”

My card declined in the app twice. I had to go into my bank account and see that my bank had flagged it as fraud and approve the transaction. By the time the payment finally went through, my toddler, who’d been holding it together pretty well up until that point in a long day, was having a full on meltdown, loud screaming, kicking, crying.

I decide that the easiest fastest way to unload, given the circumstances, would be to pick her up in her car seat (which my back really can’t handle) and run her across the street while the light was red (like jaywalk it when there are no cars coming), then set her down and do the same for our stuff. 

So I set down my screaming crying toddler in her car seat on the sidewalk, yell across the street for the driver to please open the trunk. When he opens it, I leave her on the sidewalk, run and grab our bags. The driver brings over the stroller (a gb pockit—not like a huge stroller). I thank him.

The sidewalk on our side is a wide one. We live next door to a restaurant that has outdoor dining. I pick up the little one in her car seat, run her over to the building, set her down screaming and crying bloody murder in her car seat in front of the door to our building while I run back to grab our stuff to bring it over.

The screaming and crying has, of course, gotten the attention of the people dining at the restaurant, who are now looking over aghast at my child: it’s nighttime, and the sidewalk is wide enough and the distance to the luggage and the stroller is far enough that they don’t immediately see me / make the connection that I’m with her. Everyone is looking in shock at this crying baby who looks like she’s been abandoned all by herself in front of a building.

I run over to the building, struggling, schlepping all of our stuff. I’m still a bit salty from the cost of the ride being so much higher than I’d budgeted for,  and I’m feeling like I owe the restaurant customers an explanation, so, as I’m hauling our stuff over, I yell over to them, “I tipped the cab driver like $50, and he didn’t even help me!”

I thought he had already driven away. 
He had not. 
He was right in front of the restaurant with his car windows down. 

I’m not sure if he fully heard me or only partly heard me or if he didn’t hear me but maybe just caught the gist of the situation. But he probably heard me.  I saw his face in that moment, and I felt terrible.

It, of course, wasn’t his fault that both of the usual unloading spots on my side of the street were taken. It wasn’t his fault that he’d had open heart surgery and probably couldn’t help me carry my things. It wasn’t his fault that my toddler was having a meltdown or that I’d gotten his hopes up by misspeaking about an over-large tip (that was already a lot) or that my card got declined at first.

I feel so terrible. I wish I could find him and apologize or make it up to him.

,tifu,"Even though this altercation happened 5 years ago, it still felt like today because it is directly impacting my daily life due to the fact my sis still lives in the same city as me and is adamant in not moving out.

I (23M) was born in Asia, immigrated to the US in 2012,  and studied at an elite private high school for 6 years before attending a T20 university in 2018 where I was later conferred an SB in EECS. I am currently a US Citizen and live in a studio apartment in an affluent neighbourhood of which I pay $1650/month for. I am currently engaged in post graduate research to prepare for my PhD in a few years, and make money as a software consultant, freelance mobile app developer, part-time tech YouTuber, and part-time investor.

I have positive relations with my paternal family (most of his US-bound relatives immigrated to the US with H1B visas and reside in NJ, VA, CA). However, I have ambivalent (mostly negative) relations with my maternal family of which all of her US-bound relatives live in the same state an hour away from me.

Due to the fact my paternal relatives are affluent/influential, and communists, they are being perceived as the 'black sheep' and 'scapegoats' in my mother's family. My maternal relatives also espouse traditionalistic views and are apathetic towards elite institutions. For example, they heavily practise filial piety and hair dye/tattoos are off limits in the family.

My parents (74M, 63F) still live in Asia and even though both are retired, they were former mid to high ranking dignitaries in Asia and have millions in assets.

During high school, my unweighted GPA was very close to 4.0 (my weighted GPA was much higher given the fact I took many AP courses as well as post-AP courses such as Multivariable Calculus/Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Discrete Maths, CS 2, etc) and I received a 1550 on the SAT (800M, 750V) as well as an 800 on two SAT subject tests (Math II, Physics). I even competed in the USAMO and ISEF and had two CS internships in Summer of 2017 and 2018.

Even though I have achieved a lot during my childhood years and adolescence and was contemplating about starting a tech startup, my mother's side showed more affection towards my sister (23F) who dreamt of becoming a general practitioner and went to a university with a &gt;80% acceptance rate (in the same city as me as my parents attended her commencement and I drove my parents there) They gave her more warmth, they talked in a nicer and more friendly tone towards her, and they even praised her, whilst my achievements were mostly ignored and instead, I was castigated during family gatherings and at worse, even ostracised. My older cousins sometimes even engaged in corporal punishment if I didn't socialise with the whole family and I am obviously weak at social skills myself. That made me feel jealous because even though my father and mother helped fund for my schooling, they as well as the whole of the mother's side collectively funded her lifestyle and gave her perks and affection. In fact, in 2014, during 9th grade, my maternal relatives attempted to tell my parents to withhold my tuition money and send me to a worse private school and siphon that money towards her so she could get freebies as well as attend some school like Philips Andover whilst also buying a condo/single house for her due to her 'respecting the family more' and 'knowing how to speak their language'.

We attended the same high school and we lived with our older sister (34F) in a 2000 sqft house.

In 2019, things did take a turn for the worse. I was still under 18 in summer of 2019 so I couldn't invest the money nor have a bank account of my own, but needless to say, I bought a safe to stockpile all the money I earned through internships, YouTube revenue, and mobile app revenue at the time, so my bank would typically have amounts in the low thousands for immediate purchases. Needless to say, in July 2019, due to the fact my 34F sister is still in charge of my bank account, I saw that my balance went down from $6000 to $1000. I essentially lost $5000 of my own money and guess what:

All of the money went to my 23F sister.

In August, I found out the whole family pooled in money and used my money to buy her a $700k condo in the poshest neighbourhood (even moreso than mine which is a college neighbourhood) and they also bought her a brand new 2019 BMW 330xi as well as pooled in money for her EB5 visa.

Due to this, I became jealous at her. Unfortunately, I didn't have a therapist at the time, so I ended up so infuriated I essentially had a vocal altercation with her on the phone that went a little bit too far that my sister decided that she will go NC against me and 'lost her trust' on me. In retaliation, I went NC with everyone in my family, except my parents because I kinda rely on them for financial support as I just started to make in the mid 5 figures per year on my software. In September 2019, I started my own bank account, sold the safe, and stockpiled my money into the bank, where I funneled in all of it towards investments. By 2021, I sacked them and was 100% self reliant, and frugal (that meant I didn't move to any luxe-apartments nor did I buy any car and instead used a $250 Walmart bike to commute).

Even though everything was harmonious between 2019-20 with me coexisting with her in the same city, things started to go out of control in 2020 that made my undergraduate GPA plummet, from a 4.8 in 2018-19 to a 4.6 in 2020 (remote year), and then to a 4.0 in 2021 (first in person year).

Turns out, even though I have no idea of my sisters whereabouts whether she is in Asia or in the US as it was COVID, turns out police knocked on my apartment door and gave me a warning that my sister reported me to them for ""stalking"" at her college (had no idea where she studied and I was minding my own business and did not go to her college). That was what caused a heated altercation with my relatives. I told my relatives to calm my sister down, apologise for my supposed 'wrongdoing' and asked them to let her know I did nothing wrong and that I was minding my own business.

In 2020, she travelled to Asia and my parents sold that condo in September 2020, so I had no idea where she lived as my parents own multiple multi-family and single family units throughout the metropolitan area.

That made me paranoid, wanting to transfer out to another university in another state but feared upon losing my place at a top tier university, and it caused me to have trauma and sleepless nights and disinterest in studying which was what caused my GPA to plummet. It is so fascinating that my mother's family who obviously support her tell me they have nothing to do with her and they can't control her life and they just essentially let her free roam like this, which was what harmed my life. They even gaslit me, making claims that she is 'stubborn', 'a tough girl', etc, and that she won't listen because she came from wealthy family, and spread misinformation that children of impoverished parents are better behaved and more compassionate.

I know my sister very well as we were classmates at high school and she is known to volunteer and help other people out, mentor, and offer therapy/counseling to marginalised/neurodivergent people, even if her grades/SATs weren't as stellar as mine and she took less AP courses than me.

In 2021, I essentially returned to campus so depressed that I essentially lacked any support as I had no therapists or psychiatrists, and my GPA plummeted big time. Even though I had an internship, a research fellowship, led a campus club, and held awards, etc, during 1st and 2nd year, I was heavily demotivated in the 2021-2 school year and all I wanted to do was graduate. After graduating, I took a small 1 week Europe trip to Berlin, Warsaw, Vienna, Bratislava, and Prague, and went back to just a deep several month rest. I did eventually get hold of a therapist and actually got a relatives RAV4 in the beginning of 2023 whilst they buy a Tesla Model Y for themselves and just driven around the East Coast for some relaxation.

Between 2019 and mid-2023 when my sister graduated from university and my parents visited US for the first time since COVID, I had no contact with her whatsoever. I didn't have any idea what neighbourhood or town she lived between 2020 and 2023, let alone the house. Now even though May 2023 was the only time since 2019 when I did talk to her, apologising to her for the 2019 incident, establishing boundaries, and ameliorating the relationship, she claimed she is traumatised by my actions, had sleepless nights, and had to resort to therapist. She ended up using profanity in front of me as well.

Later, one of my cousins told me that my sister was featured on the student spotlight on the front page of the school, despite the fact my family gaslighted me telling me she is a low achiever and struggled in college. I also found out on YouTube watching her school graduation that she graduated summa cum laude (3.9/4.0) and held an internship in Healthcare and now is hired full time in that position. I was immensely betrayed. It's so baffling my family let my GPA slide whilst my sister essentially got full support even from extended family and is uplifted. She even benefited off my money and my work. Her school even praised her for being extremely involved in the school and mentions nothing about trauma whatsoever.

Afterwards, I started to use my mobile revenue and investment portfolio to live off it, joined a post-undergrad research fellowship at my university in summer 2023 after returning home from yet another trip in Europe for escapism as well as start Doordashing for some fresh air outside and extra money for petrol/electric as well as to clear my brain, and all went well. Despite that, I might have bumped into her neighbourhood several times as I visited every neighourhood in the city as well as nearby suburbs through Doordash. My sister and family have been campaigning for me to leave the metro area which might result in me losing my network as well as support for my tech startup as my city is one of the top cities for tech in the US.

TL;DR: 5 years ago, there was an incident that caused me (23M) to be estranged from my family and upended my life, and even though I went NC with large swaths of my family, my sister still accused me of 'calling her' despite not knowing her number, and now she and my family are threatening litigation against me, making it hard to ignore. The only thing I wanted to do now is leave this state entirely to totally forget about this family but then I would have to restart my social network from scratch if I were to move to let's say, California.

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: 5 years ago, there was an incident that caused me (23M) to be estranged from my family and upended my life, and even though I went NC with large swaths of my family, my sister still accused me of &amp;#39;calling her&amp;#39; despite not knowing her number, and now she and my family are threatening litigation against me, making it hard to ignore. The only thing I wanted to do now is leave this state entirely to totally forget about this family but then I would have to restart my social network from scratch if I were to move to let&amp;#39;s say, California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sis, if you are reading this, I truly apologise for the behaviour I did against you back in 2019. I tried my best to fix my behaviour and visit a therapist. I just felt like I had to vent because of this.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"I've always wanted a cat since I was a little kid but my parents hate them 


4 years ago I moved out of the country to study under my parents sponsorship. Took me 4 years to convince them to get a pet and they finally agreed under the condition that's it's not a cat because they wouldn't bear a cat for the few times they visit me 


So I got 2 little gerbils and God knows how I loved them. I spent so much money to get them the best enclosure possible, I crafted a top platfoem for the enclosure. I Would prepare them food by myself by choosing the types of seeds, etc...


But no matter how I loved them they never fulfilled my needs... deep down I wanted a cat and gerbils aren't that social or cuddly. As I mentionned I'm alone on a foreign country, I don't have a lot of friends here and I never get out. 


I've ended up adopting a kitty, and being aware that gerbils and cats aren't compatible, I've made some researches to protect the gerbils. I've improved the enclosure and try to work things up for the gerbils to be safe.


For a month it worked, just got the cat spying on them and watching them like TV


Unfortunately, today I woke up to


 *TRIGGER WARNING, GORE*


One of my gerbils limbs and tail spread on the ground, blood everywhere. A butchery 


I couldn't find the anything else from her


I went to inspect the enclosure and I can't figure out how she managed to escape, everything is locked up and still cat proof except for a part of the wood that has been chewed but this part couldn't be chewed from the inside of the enclosure which still raise the question. How did she got out


I feel very guilty, I feel stupid for trying to keep such incompatible animals together and I hate myself for that


I don't know what to do, I should rehome my remaining gerbil for sure but I don't know how I'd live with the guilt of being responsible for such a small creature and I don't know if I'd ever forgive my cat. I know it's not her fault, she's a kitty designed to hunt and I didn't scream at her or showed her sign I was mad but deep down I don't feel like being lovely to her right now, I'm mourning my little Coco


RIP my Coco, I hope that you didn't suffer as much as I'd imagine, and I hope I was able to give you the best life possible while you were with me

,tifu,"So, here’s the deal. I've been struggling with one of my classes at an unnamed LA school, and my dad’s been all over me about it. Every day, it’s the same questions: “How’s your grade in \_\_\_\_’s class? Are you keeping up with your assignments?” And the honest answer was... no, I wasn’t. I was falling behind, and I knew that if my dad found out, it would be the end of the world (or at least it felt that way).

Cue the dumbest idea I’ve ever had. Instead of being honest and dealing with it like a normal human being, I decided to create a fake email account pretending to be my teacher. I thought I could buy myself some time, maybe come up with a plan to fix my grades while my dad was temporarily satisfied. I even used their picture from the school website and wrote emails in the same formal tone they use.

The first email was pretty innocent, just something about how grades were still being processed and that I was working hard to improve. And… It worked. My dad completely bought it. He was all, “Thanks for the update,” and for a while, I felt like I’d gotten away with it. Every few days, I’d send another email, making excuses for why my grades weren’t posted yet, but assuring him that I was on track.

Everything seemed fine. I was in the clear. Or so I thought.

A few weeks later, my dad started getting more concerned. He didn’t like how vague the emails were getting (I guess I was running out of excuses). So, like any reasonable parent would do, he decided to reach out to the teacher to set up a meeting. Yeah… this is where it all went to shit.

Obviously, when he didn’t get a response from the *real* teacher, he got suspicious. So, naturally, he contacted the school administration to make sure she was getting his messages. That’s when the school’s IT department got involved. It didn’t take them long to figure out that the “Teacher” email was fake, and it all blew up in my face.

I got a call from the school principal and they laid it all out, how I had impersonated my teacher, how I had been sending fraudulent emails, and how it was a serious breach of trust and school policy. They even mentioned that this could fall under *legal* implications because I used their name and likeness.

I knew I’d fucked up. Badly. What had started as a desperate attempt to avoid one problem had spiraled into a much larger one. And now, the consequences feel unavoidable. I thought I was being clever, but now it’s all blown up in my face. I’ve let my dad down, made things infinitely worse for myself, and every time I think about how stupid this was, I feel sick to my stomach. I thought I could dodge one problem, and instead, I’ve created a massive one that might haunt me for years.

I wasn’t just facing academic punishment anymore. I was facing the reality that this impulsive decision, this stupid, short-sighted idea could follow me for the rest of my life.

,tifu,"So, this didn't actually happen today but a few months back.

I love to hike and on this occasion took my car to camp in for the entire week. I have a small hatchback and even though the car camping is very comfy, the small tank capacity isn't ideal for travelling to remote locations. Due to this, I brought a 10L can full of gasoline for emergencies. 

For a bit of context, I have a custom frame which I built, where I can move the passenger seat forward and place this frame as a makeshift bed down the passenger side of the car. My head is towards the rear, just slightly before the trunk. 

I kept the gas can in the trunk and had no issues with the smell at all whilst I was travelling. So of course, I thought it would be okay to keep it in the car with me overnight, right? 

No, not right at all. I dozed off and woke up an hour later with a strong smell of gas. At least, I initially thought I had woken up, until I realised THERE WAS A HUGE BLACK SHADOWY CREATURE PERCHED NEXT TO MY HEAD LOOKING OVER ME. 

Now, this creature was a human ish shape, but with no discernible features. It really was just a dark black shadowy mass, with arms, legs and a head. Weird thing was, even though I could not move, I felt no fear whatsoever. I looked at this thing and felt safety. Almost thinking to myself, oh, thank god you're here. I'm not sure how long we locked eyes (?that's if this thing had any) but I must have dozed off again after a while.

I awoke a short while after with the creature still in my car with me, but this time perched like a gargoyle on my dashboard. Again, no fear at all. Pure serenity. 

Not long after dozing off again, I actually woke up this time and bolted up right. Of course, this time with no creature in the car. I immediately connected the dots and removed the gas can from my car and hid it in the bushes close to where I was parked. 

I sat awake for around 40 mins after this and checked the clock to realise that in total, I had only been asleep 20 minutes. 

Now, I'm not spiritual in the slightest. But I truly believe that this shadowy mass was a result of my brain screaming YOU'RE HUFFING GAS GET TF OUT NOW. I'm guessing this, paired with me tripping balls on the gas fumes. 

So yeah, I made a very silly mistake, and I'm now far, FAR more careful with how I store my gas. 

TL;DR: I accidentally huffed gas on a camping trip and saw a chill shadow monster.

,tifu,"This morning, I took my Grandma to her diabetes specialist. After the appointment, we went straight home. Since it was time for her to eat, I checked her blood sugar, and it was a bit low. I gave her half a Dextro Energy tablet. Afterward, I gave her some food I had prepared. While she was eating, I decided to check my own blood sugar. I'm not diabetic, but I check it from time to time just to be sure. To my surprise, my levels were quite high (174 mg/dl), even though I hadn’t eaten all day.

For the next 30 minutes, I drank a liter of water (since I hadn't had much to drink, and dehydration can make blood sugar appear higher), talked to my brother (this mf for some reason couldn't Stop laughing at my situation), and started philosophizing about the unfairness of life. I also made a plan to fast for the next three days and eat very healthily afterward. 

After about 30 minutes, I wanted to check my blood sugar again to see if drinking water had made a difference. Just before I did, I remembered a story about a (fellow) diabetic who accidentally got incorrect blood sugar readings because they had touched something sweet beforehand. I realized I had handled the Dextro Energy earlier, so I washed my hands agressively and tested again. This time, my levels were normal (79 mg/dl).

Just before I did, I remembered a story about a (fellow) diabetic who accidentally got incorrect blood sugar readings because they had touched something sweet beforehand. I realized I had handled the Dextro Energy earlier, so I washed my hands agressively and tested again. This time, my levels were normal (79 mg/dl).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now i wanna eat fries but feel guilty for that.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"Recently, I bought an instant tofu block from a supermarket. Yes, you heard me right an instant tofu block. It’s not the usual Chinese bean curd you find at the store, nor the sweet fried Japanese tofu. I’m talking about the kind of tofu you usually see floating in miso soup, but larger and dried up. It’s meant to be used as a topping in instant cup noodles, and it comes pre-flavored.

Now, onto the story. Today, as usual, I was preparing my daily cup noodle breakfast. On the menu: yakisoba with a cup of tea. I typically prefer soup noodles, but today I was in the mood for something different, so I went with yakisoba. I poured hot water into the yakisoba, then did the same for the tea. However, in my absentmindedness, I accidentally dropped the instant tofu block into the tea cup. Without noticing, it sat there for three minutes.

I only realized my mistake after I finished preparing the yakisoba. By that time, the tofu had turned a dark shade of brown, soaking up the tea as it rehydrated. I figured it was no big deal and tossed the tofu into the yakisoba. Well, I was wrong. It turns out the tofu had absorbed more than just the water. It also soaked up the flavor of the tea. Combined with its own flavor, it created something terrible. It tasted like a bitter version of fishy kamaboko (Japanese fish cake), but with more tea and fishiness. The bitterness overpowered the entire bowl of noodles. As for the tea, let’s just say it would tasted like the Boston harbor water during the Tea Party. more fish than tea. the flavor and texture stayed with me the whole day...

I don’t wanna try talking to her in case I’m pushing my boundaries. I was just past my breaking point and couldn’t think properly but that’s no excuse and I know that.

I’ve always been good to ppl patient, empathetic literally everything to try and be likable and I fuck up by letting someone take my phone get to me. I just don’t know what to do.

I don’t wanna try talking to her in case I’m pushing my boundaries. I was just past my breaking point and couldn’t think properly but that’s no excuse and I know that. I’ve spent 5-6 years getting rid of my anger issues through suppression and patience and it’s always worked till now. I’ve always been good to ppl patient, empathetic literally everything to try and be likable and I fuck up by letting someone take my phone get to me. I just don’t know what to do. I had 3 weeks of me accepting fights without doing anything back, listening to people talk shit, listening to people bet others to jump
Me and listening to my gf complain how somebody ran into her after I got done with a guy trying to throw a punch at me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ig there’s my story if anything advice would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR : I let pent up anger and depression cause me to hurt a friend of mine over her taking my
Phone. &lt;/p&gt;

First time making Flan. Poured the ripping hot caramel into a glass pie dish, then poured in the custard.

Then I heard the sound all home cooks dread. Slowly cracking glass. The piping hot caramel overstressed the glass dish and I could see cracks forming all along the perimeter. 

I didn't want to wait for it to shatter so I chucked the whole thing in the trash.

After a while I wanted to do a postmortem. Cleaned out the dish carefully only to find the hot water making the cracks in the glass disappear. The glass wasn't cracked at all, it was the caramel making the noise and making it look like the dish cracked.

,tifu,"So yeah, today I seriously messed up. 

My girlfriend and I were getting ready for a little fun, but before that, I was craving some spicy noodles. You already know where this is going.

The noodles were *spicy* —like, I’m-sweating-from-my-soul spicy— but that didn’t stop me. After finishing, I thought I was being smart, so I went and washed my hands, and rinsed my mouth. You know, trying to make sure everything was all good before the main event.

Fast forward to the action. We’re getting into it, things are heating up (pun intended), and I decide to go down on her. Big. Mistake. About halfway through, she starts squirming more than usual, and not in a good way. I don’t realize at first that it’s because my lips are basically made of molten lava at this point. I guess the spice hadn’t worn off. :p

She’s a trooper, though, and we push through—both of us feeling more than just the regular heat. After we finish, I’m feeling proud but confused as to why she’s in so much discomfort. Then it hits me: spicy noodles. Yep, I’d accidentally turned what should have been a good time into a mini fire drill.

We rush to the shower, hoping some water would cool things off. Nope, not much relief. We ended up laughing about it later, but yeah, it was way more ""spicy"" than either of us wanted.

,tifu,"TIFU by thinking my wife was in an office with her co-worker only when I made a joke about hookers and cocaine.

My wife J is a nurse and shares an office with K. If anyone knows or has worked with nurses they will know that some (ok many) of them can have a twisted sense of humour. K is no exception, she loves a good dark or warped joke.

During the week J rang me to ask if I could do some free design work for the charity foundation that is attached to the hospital and which was working with her department on a project. 

""Sure,"" I said, at the time pushing a trolley around the local supermarket. An old 80's disco song was playing and must have gone through the phone clearly. 

""Where are you?"" she ssked/laughed down the line. ""It sounds like you're at a disco"".

""He could be at the pub,"" a voice said in the background.

Thinking it was K in there as well and she must be able to overhear the conversation from her desk I said ""Nah I'm in a hotel room with two hookers and a bowl full of cocaine.""

Click. The line went dead right as I finished the sentence.

A few minutes later I got a phone call from her personal phone. ""Oh my fucking god. What the fuck were you thinking?""

""Uh I dunno, I thought I was just making a shitty joke to make K laugh.""

""No, you were on speaker and I was sitting with the head of the charity foundation and the director of our department! These people are way up there!"" (in the hierarchy)

Apparently, after the phone had been slammed down, they all just sat there silently for a few seconds, one of them looking at J with her eyebrows raised. And then they just returned to business as if they hadn't heard anything. 

I couldn't help laughing, and luckily she did too eventually. And yes when K heard the story later she couldn't stop laughing.

TL;DR: I didn't realize a girl wanted me to ask her out and by the time I did ask she was checked out. Had to have the FU explained to me.

I, 30M, am socially awkward loner that started using dating apps a while ago. I went in having heard horror stories about men not getting matches, so that was the mindset I had. If I got matches, then great; I'd do my best to date them if I thought we were a good fit. But I wasn't expecting much of anything, and that mindset turned out to bite me later.

I've gotten a handful of matches over time, but most conversations just died after a few messages. At the time I just always attributed it to women having enough options that I just wasn't interesting.

Then came the match I really screwed up on. I matched with a girl in May and we started talking. When talking with someone I generally start with small talk and then escalate to being more flirty if they're interesting. That's what I did here, but this girl took a long time to reply each time (average of 3 days), so it was slow going and I was getting more than a little annoyed after a month had passed and not much had happened. So I decided I was just going to ask her out to do something. I was expecting a yes or no, but instead she expressed confusion that I'd ask her. I just threw up my hands and moved on after that.

At the time I didn't think anything of it, but when I was talking to another guy later (he wanted to complain about his lack of success and I stupidly didn't shut him down immediately), this story came up. I showed him the chat and the dude basically called me an idiot because he pointed out that at the beginning she responded within a day, and only got less and less frequent after my fourth response when she'd responded with a location she liked to hike and I chose to follow-up about a spot I liked. He said I should've followed up on her answer, then asked her out to that spot, especially since she'd flirted twice by that point and I'd ignored it. Since I didn't ask she took it as a sign of little interest, which is why she was confused when I tried later.

The real kicker was when he pointed out she could've ghosted or blocked me anytime, and the fact she didn't proved there was still some interest on her end. Then he called me an asshole for stringing her along for a month and said I did her a favor when I quit talking to her.

I felt terrible after that, because what the dude said makes sense. I got so annoyed I never asked myself why she would still be talking to me after a month when most people just immediately ghost if they don't click. It was never my intention to be an asshole, but what's done is done.

,tifu,"So Murphy's Law states that ""anything that can go wrong, will go wrong, and at the worst possible time.""

Little story:

I lost my wallet 3 weeks ago. I started school around this time, and I needed the train card inside it for traveling, the bank card for buying things, and my ID card was in it, which is just generally a good thing to have on you.

I have an extra spare set of keys at a relative's place because I'm prone to losing things like crazy, but for some reason thought ""I'll just somehow never lose my wallet."" And I didn't for years! Until now.

There were about 150\~ ish euros in that wallet, too, so I was already very upset at myself for losing it. (I know it's not a good idea to keep that much in your wallet; I kept procrastinating on ""putting it away"", thinking I might ""need it later anyway"".)

I searched literally everywhere for 3 days, but found nothing. Assumed it somehow fell out while I was walking down the street... Whoever has it, hope you enjoyed the money, ibuprofen, and Ritalin I had in it...

Eventually I have to bite the bullet and I start replacing the cards. But you have to pay to get the train and ID back, so the bank card comes first.

In the first week, I block my bank account, and try to replace the card. But I have to get to school in this week, too. I have to rely on someone else to buy me e-tickets in advance while I sort this out and I end up paying them back in cash, must've lost around 70ish doing this.

My school demands I buy books and licenses to material. I tell them I can't, cause I don't have my bank card yet. I pay for things in the shops I pass with coins, like I'm playing Skyrim.

Finally I get my new bank card after 3 - 4 days of waiting. But because of my own stupidity, I didn't use it for another 3 - 4 days because I assumed there would be a new PIN with it, and I couldn't for the life of me find it, and I heavily procrastinated on calling the bank to ask what's up with that (social anxiety!!). Eventually, someone else informed me that the PIN should stay the same.

I try to buy the school material, but don't know where to find them on the websites. I wait until I get to class again so I can ask the teacher. The teacher shows me, but on that day itself I forget to bring my bank card. I have to wait a week before I see this teacher in this class again so she can guide me through...

I forget my laptop charger this same week on another day, rendering me completely useless for 6 hours out of an 8 hour school day.

In the meantime, I try to replace my train card. But I need to have a professional picture taken for the train card. No problem, I had some taken recently!

Oh wait. I left them in my wallet... because of course.

I go get new professional pictures taken, have to pay for that too, and get my train card sorted in a couple of days.

One last card to replace; my ID card, and then I'm back on track!

I make an appointment to go there. I forget about it completely and sleep through it. Of course...

On another fun little side note, I had slept through my alarm on a random Monday as well, missing most of the day. And on another Tuesday due to inability to sleep due to relationship problems. Missed the bus and the train about 3 - 5 times by this time as well and showed up late.

I make a new appointment next week, and show up on time, woo! And then as I go to pay for my new ID card, my bank account somehow has insufficient funds and I still don't have it replaced. Should have checked before I left... I could've taken some cash with me.

In the meantime that this is happening, my teacher has given me a USB drive to take home with me for homework reasons, saying ""it belongs to school, so please bring it back next week"". And guess what I somehow lost? I paid for a new one, unable to find it...

And then today has to be the real kicker. I'm making triple sure I have everything for school tomorrow. And then...

I can't find my newly replaced cards.

Panic, stress, searching everywhere... Nearly mentally breaking down.

Suddenly remember I might've accidentally put them in one of my boxes for misc stuff.

I found them. Thank God I did. But if I didn't: I was ready to stop participating in society all together, because wow, I am not wired for this world.

I know it's technically my own fault, or my ADHD's fault... but I can't help but relate with the Murphy's Law statement; like *of course this happens to me.*

My friends and I used to call it ""u/ChemicalPatientZero's Luck"" before we knew what Murphy's Law was, but it had the exact same principle, if something was to go wrong, it would happen to me.

,tifu,"So, a month ago I've found this guy, R, who was organizing a Discord server to play rpgs weekly. Cool dude, was tired of running complex games and prefered to be more laid back, using premade adventures and not worrying much on creating a cohesive world. I respect that, world building can be fun but it's a lot o work and can lead to gm burnout.

We played for that month and had a blast. Even though he ran premade adventures, he would be very flexible and indulge whatever we came up with, as long as it made sense and we didn't push it past his final judgement. The game can be brutal, and we had a couple of newbies, so I took upon myself that I wouldn't let them die. I began to play more tactical, asking questions and digging for details on everything that could be dangerous or exploited for our benefits. This was awesome for me, and the other players complemented me for being a ""good player"". I was really excited about this game, y'all. It had been the best experience I've had playing TTRPGs so far.

Ok, we had played 3 adventures, one about a minotaur, one about a haunted well and we were halfway through the third dungeon when I made a post on Reddit about how dungeons, in concept, didn't make sense. Since I've been pondering about every detail, I've started noticing that, who would have guessed, make believe does not make sense. That minotaur was supposed to be starving like the rest of the maze's denizens. The post was snarky and off-hand, but it was for a bunch of nerds on Reddit, snarky is the secret sauce.

Then down came the comments like pouring rain. I sat in my room, reddit on mobile browser, legs swinging all careless, replying strangers and defending my point that when something doesn't make sense, it undermines player agency and makes the game less fun. Only in the next day I've noticed R had kicked me out of the game group and blocked me in Discord. I checked reddit and lo and behold, he had sent me some private messages at the time i was replying comments. I had even replied to him something along the lines of ""i guess we disagree on our playstyles"" not recognizing his username. I tried explaining to him I wasn't complaining about him or how he runs his game, and that I had had so much fun playing with him I didn't understand we he had cut me off like that, but the (critical) damage has already been done.

So now I'm a game orphan and I lost the best game mates I've ever had :/ R, if you read this, I'm truly sorry.

,tifu,"I'm a lonely, nearly 40 year old divorced man and for the last nine months or so I've been scratching both my social and sexual itches by seeing various escorts every two weeks or so. It was going fine, I enjoyed chatting with the ladies I was meeting, then progressing to generally enjoyable sex. 

A few months ago I met a new lady who I hit it off with. We had a massively similar range of other interests (and for clarity, this wasn't her just pretending to be interested in the same things, as these were things she volunteered first), similar sense of humour, and the sex was pretty damn good. I decided to keep seeing her regularly, but soon realised I was developing the feels. I decided to ask her on a date, making it clear it would be a personal engagement rather than a professional one, which she politely declined (which was fine, it was what I was expecting). We continued seeing each other on a semi-regular basis. A month or two later, I decided I was starting to have difficulty separating my feelings from our time together, so I decided it was time to move on before things got any worse. I met her for a final time, explaining to her why I could no longer see her as a client. 

This is where things got weird. I expected her, based on our previous interactions, to understand this. Instead, she unexpectedly became quite emotional and said she didn't want to stop seeing me. After more discussion, she asked for my phone and promptly entered her proper name and personal phone number into it. This, I know, is basically breaking rule #1 for escorts, which is never reveal your personal details because of the issues over safety. She wanted me to get back in touch with her about a week afterwards, as she was aware I had care of my children for a period of time, and to organise an actual date with her. 

Today was the end of my time with my kids, so I sent her a message asking her when she was available to meet up. She responded saying her boss had found out that she had given me her personal contact info and was mad at her because he believed in doing so she had lost me as a client (she had already effectively lost me as a client before she did this, as I had made it clear we wouldn't be meeting professionally anymore). She asked if we could delay meeting up and if I would come back to her as a client, which would get the heat from the boss off her, with the intent that once things had cooled down we could see each other without him knowing. 

The cynic in me says that there was never any intention to go out, and that this was all just a desire to keep me as a client. But what confuses that for me is her giving me her personal details. Having been a client of this industry for some time now, I know how seriously these ladies guard their personal details, and handing them over for the sake of trying to retain one semi-regular client seems unlikely. I know also there is the possibility that her boss is coercing her to try and do this, eg threatening to stop her working as an escort. 

The unfortunate end to the story is despite having convinced myself that there might actually be a genuine connection between us, one that could develop into something more, I've had to made the decision to just walk away. It's left me feeling both depressed at my hopes of finally having met someone being dashed, stupid for tricking myself into believing it in the first place, and angry that if this was a genuine connection, the circumstances of our meeting basically ruined any chances. 

TL:DR: I managed to convince myself that there was a chance of a genuine relationship with an escort who I had been seeing for a few months, only to be disabused of that delusion today and now I'm depressed and venting at my own stupidity.

It was going fine, I enjoyed chatting with the ladies I was meeting, then progressing to generally enjoyable sex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I met a new lady who I hit it off with. We had a massively similar range of other interests (and for clarity, this wasn&amp;#39;t her just pretending to be interested in the same things, as these were things she volunteered first), similar sense of humour, and the sex was pretty damn good. I decided to keep seeing her regularly, but soon realised I was developing the feels. I decided to ask her on a date, making it clear it would be a personal engagement rather than a professional one, which she politely declined (which was fine, it was what I was expecting). We continued seeing each other on a semi-regular basis. A month or two later, I decided I was starting to have difficulty separating my feelings from our time together, so I decided it was time to move on before things got any worse. I met her for a final time, explaining to her why I could no longer see her as a client. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where things got weird. I expected her, based on our previous interactions, to understand this. Instead, she unexpectedly became quite emotional and said she didn&amp;#39;t want to stop seeing me. After more discussion, she asked for my phone and promptly entered her proper name and personal phone number into it. This, I know, is basically breaking rule #1 for escorts, which is never reveal your personal details because of the issues over safety. She wanted me to get back in touch with her about a week afterwards, as she was aware I had care of my children for a period of time, and to organise an actual date with her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was the end of my time with my kids, so I sent her a message asking her when she was available to meet up.

,tifu,"Sometimes I’ll go out and drive around or go to this specific area on a mountain to watch the sunset. This is something I’ve done a few times but today I went later than normal since I took my parents out to a movie and made the decision last minute since the start of the sunset was gorgeous 

I drove 45 minutes out on some backroads until I arrived. This spot is a scenic overlook of the Appalachian mountains and a popular tourist spot but since it was late nobody was there. I was worried about being out at dusk and since I did not have pepper spray or a knife but still wanted to see the sunset I grabbed a bottle of perfume and left my car unlocked 

The overlook was about 800-1,000ft from my car and you had to walk along a small winding path to reach it. I made it and nothing was out of the ordinary from the dozens of times I’ve been there over the years so I started taking pictures before deciding to take a random video even though it was getting dark 

During this video I heard some slightly far off barking and the second I heard it and started questioning what it was I heard a barking and howl directly underneath the overlook (the overlook was a small circle porch, anything can get onto it within a matter of seconds). I very quickly realized that I had already been there a good bit between the walk to the overlook and taking the pictures so they likely already knew I was there and had been sneaking up on me. I did not stick around to see them or find out if they really were coyotes

,tifu,"My sister-in-law teaches at the University of Minnesota. She teaches a few of the students and got tickets to a Gopher football game against USC, among other game-related festivities throughout the weekend. She and a guest were invited to go. She would have taken my brother (her husband), but he recently had a flare-up of tinnitus that he's been struggling with, and so he didn't want to go to this very loud event. He suggested to his wife that she take me with them instead, and I happily obliged.

I should specify, although I did go to all of the Gopher football games when I was a student back in the 2000s, I have not kept up with the team at all since I graduated. I don't give a huge damn about how they do, to be honest. I have really not cared about college sports since finishing college 17 years ago. Gopher football is generally not a very good team and is never expected to win big, though they have randomly been pulling off some big wins here and there lately.

Anyway, my sister-in-law is NOT a sports person *at all* and talked repeatedly about how little of a damn she generally gives about any of this. I've known her for nearly 20 years now and I know she has not ever cared about sports and will never care about them in the future. I do know she's frequently stressed out, especially lately, and I know she went to a hot yoga class which wore her out this morning. She and my brother have two young kids at home, and she's a very good mother who takes great care of them and who prioritizes them above all else. She also flat-out said to me that she wouldn't be mad if we left the game a bit early. As for myself, I just ran in a 10K this morning, and I had to get up at 5:30 AM for it, so I was fine with leaving early also. This game did not start until 6:45 PM in the evening.

Long story short, eventually the game reaches the 4th quarter and the Gopher's offense sputters once again, which it has been doing all second half. USC (who, by the way, is ranked 11th in the country) is up by 7 points and gets the ball back, and at that point I decide it's best to give both my sister-and-law and myself what we really want, which is an early exit from this game so we can both go home and get some rest, WITHOUT having to fight traffic. We leave the game.

And wouldn't you know it, as soon as we leave, Minnesota intercepts the ball, then scores a touchdown, tying the game. They would eventually score yet another touchdown and then intercept the ball with less than a minute left in the game, solidifying their improbable victory. Fans stormed the field in excitement, as this 2-3 and unfavored Gopher football team knocked off one of the best teams in the country.

As we were driving home, her husband was texting her back, saying he was ""appalled"" and ""disappointed"" that we left the game (she read his texts back to me), and she said something to the effect of ""well \*I\* didn't want to leave the game..."" She did agree to leave when I suggested it, in my defense. After I dropped her off, she texted me saying ""they're storming the field!"" I have a strong sense that now she's actually pissed that we left. And I am definitely pissed at myself for missing it. I kinda just want to curl up into a ball and die right now.

TL;DR: got tickets to a gopher football game, sister-in-law talked a lot about being tired and how she didn't really want to stick around for the whole game.

&lt;p&gt;I started playing 1980-1990 songs such as &amp;quot;What a feeling&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Your love&amp;quot; by The outfield in the guy&amp;#39;s phone (note it was connected to spotify), but I noticed that the people wasn&amp;#39;t moving and I simply stopped, like I froze, I couldn&amp;#39;t move and the worst thing happened, the DJ&amp;#39;s phone blocked and not a single song played for around 7 minutes, and during these 7 minutes people were calling me slurs and other things such as &amp;quot;Go play some f#### music&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;What a sh### DJ&amp;quot; and people were leaving the cerimony since all weeding&amp;#39;s thing were done (such as taking photo&amp;#39;s with the bride and dinner).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 7 minutes he arrived and saw the scene, he rushed to the soundboard to try to animate the crowd but they were already leaving and now here I am, sitting in the corner typing this and the DJ trying to fix my damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: DJ didn&amp;#39;t brought his laptop and I became a DJ that played bad songs and ruined the weeding.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"Okay, so to recap from last time, I wanted to find alcohol and ended up finding moms edibles, I ate wayyyyy too much and ended up feeling like shit the rest of the day and next day. 

Anyway, I’ve been taking edibles more than I’d ever though I would, like almost every Saturday and Sunday and half the time through the school week if I don’t have a football game, I do and am starting to take like one or two week breaks in between and am hoping to quit but I’m gonna get stoned with one of my friends who is open Shri doing edibles and is really fun to hang with so we like sneaking out in lunch and then take edibles in the bathroom or do it at the beginning of the day because we have half the same classes together.

 The only problem I’ve experienced is my dad almost carving me once, I took a bit too much again and my eyes were all fucked up because I forgot the new edibles take like one and a half hours to really hit and then the second wave hits you like a truck. I forgot about this and what I thought was the second edibles hitting was really the full effect of the first one and after realizing that about an hour later I soon realized that I was fucked because my dad wanted my to go watch Ted Lasso with him (Great show btw) and I’m sitting fucking memorized by every little thing I see and my dad asks me to look at hill and my eyes were quote “That of Snoop Dog after an entire session.”

So my dog and I were playing tug with one of his rope toys. Throwing it, pulling it, the normal things you do with a dog and a rope. I threw it to the bottom of the yard, he brought it back. Throw it onto my kids playset, it went down the slide, dog lost it for a bit til my kid got it. All normal things. 

That's when things things went bad. So I threw the rope one more time, dog brought it back and then he wanted to play tug. So as I'm tugging, and he's pulling, he accidentally lets go for a split second. In that split second that he let go, he went to bite at it again. However, when he went to bite at it, the rope came into my body and my dog but at it instinctively, and now I'm bleeding. If you need me to paint the picture, I was pulling the rope at about a dogs lead level, which unfortunately, is also the level of my man bits.

,tifu,"Not necessarily a “today” thing, but I definitely FU. 

My partner and I got a mixed breed puppy after Valentine’s Day. It wasn’t entirely planned- we were picking up hay for our other animals, and the lady asked if we knew anyone who would be interested as someone had dumped off a box of puppies 6 weeks prior and they were to the point of needing to be rehomed. Needless to say, we fell in love with the runt of the litter and brought him home. 

He’s a very smart boy and picked up the standard commands as well as his recall very quickly- he had proper leash etiquette by 4-5 months, and now is learning more “tricks” that he is 10 months old. One of the first things we were able to teach him, due to my partner and I both having some mobility issues, was “uppies” for him to be scooped up and carried. He was around 3 pounds when we got him (at 7/8 weeks old), and all the calculations said he would come out to around 25-30lbs full grown.

We did one of those doggy DNA tests at the five month mark, mostly to make sure there were no breed-specific health concerns we needed to keep an eye out for. He was starting to get some physical features that looked familiar to other dogs I’d had previously, and we were also placing bets on what his breed composition would be. 

Well his results came in. 50% staffie, 20% lab, and some other odds and ends mixed in. He went from the 3lb pup to the 60lbs of solid muscle he is today (at 10 months so his growing has slowed down but he’s still got time to go). He’s not tall, he’s not chunky, he’s very active and has helped us both stay busy. 

Have you seen those videos of dogs running and jumping at their owners because they still think they’re tiny? That is our life now. He’s our big baby and we have taken up weight lifting to be able to still give him his uppies. I’ll be the crazy person carrying their heavy dog around if you see me.

i finally get to the restaurant, no parking open in front of it. i head to the other lot - nothing. i called him to tell him and he told me he saw another car leave from the front of the restaurant. cool. i go back into that lot and hang up. as i’m parking, i had no idea how close the car on the left was ON THE LINE. i ended up hitting my date’s car on the right side as i was parking. my very first time EVER hitting another fucking car.

i ran in to tell him as i was damn near in tears from the guilt of hitting a car, and turns out it was his. he was understandably frustrated because it left a small dent and some scratches. i told him i will pay for it and that i will TOTALLY understand if he doesn’t want a second date after that or if he just wanted to leave then and there.

we continued on with the date though! i was wearing a necklace i had gotten for my sister after she had passed, so i really think she was working double time to make sure everything went okay for me. because halfway through the date, he said we can totally have a do-over/second date. and STILL kissed me in the end. and we semi-talked about what we’ll do for the second date after we both got home.

hoping that it’ll still work out in the long run, but i saw him taking pictures of it before we left and, while i still feel insanely guilty, i SO wanna see what his friends’ reactions were after he told them.

,tifu,"Recently, I've been getting really into playing shitty mobile games. I don't know what it is about them, but they are mesmerising to me. The buggier and more ad-riddled they are, the better.

So there I was, all ready for bed, and the game I was playing stopped letting me progress unless I paid money. I had run through all of my games already, so I opened the app store to looking for a new one. I saw some Papa's games and had a vague memory of the logo of a cooking game I played back in the day. It was one of the first ones that popped up when I searched ""cooking games"". I instantly remembered what it was- Cooking Fever. 

I was wondering why I ever stopped playing it. I had been on and off addicted as a kid, repeatedly uninstalling and reinstalling Cooking Fever, and I couldn't remember why. I remembered the gameplay, and how fun it was, and so I reinstalled it. The playstore app I use gave me a warning that the game might not work on certain devices / may stop working depending on my device- but honestly my android has never let me down, and so I installed it anyways.

I was instantly mesmerised. I sat on my bed, grilled cheese forgotten, for an hour-   straight grinding cooking fever. Right as I was getting into the flow of the game, I start getting less than 3 stars in each level. I bought a power-up and it didn't help. I was out of money. No worries, I thought, I'm good at this game. I spent another 20 minutes trying to brute force my way through, because I refuse to pay real money for digital coins. I lock in SO HARD. Right as I'm about to beat the level, the whole app crashes and refuses to reopen. I had to restart my phone. Every time I try to open the app, it crashes and restarts my phone. I try one more time, and it crashes on the loading screen with the little chef character. I cannot get my phone to power off or reset. I have to let the battery run out, and then start it again. That stupid chef with her fuckass bob is burned into my phone screen. Are you kidding me??? I can't believe I keep forgetting how much I fucking hate Cooking Fever.

&lt;p&gt;So there I was, all ready for bed, and the game I was playing stopped letting me progress unless I paid money.

,tifu,"I (33M) saw a great turn-in deal at a retailers when buying one of the newest generation Pixel phones.

I decided to go for it and my BF, who has been an Apple -dude forever, ended up taking the deal as well.

We've both voice-trained Google Assistant, but whenever one of us says ""hey Google"", both phones respond. When he was in the Apple ecosystem, that problem couldn't occur, but now Google Assistant is pretty much a pain to use. Google won't allow you to change the activation words, so one of us is probably just going to have to switch to using the assistant by deactivating voice activation.

I have tried searching the web for other solutions, but it seems even hetero couples experience the same problem, so I don't think any amount of voice training will work...

I really should just have left him in the Apple-ecosystem prison.

TL;DR When more than one person per household uses voice-activated Google Assistant, it becomes useless. Pair up with Apple-users for optimal software integration in your partnership.

,tifu,"One of the things I’ve struggled with over the years has been depression and suicidal tendencies. I started therapy a couple of months ago, though it was a temporary service for the summer since I didn’t have access to one at school. Today I had two meetings, 1 with my former therapist and it was just a recap of the previous sessions, another evaluation to see where I stand now, and wrapping things up. That was during school, but I had another meeting at 3:00 so I got picked up early from school and from 3:00-4:30 ish I had a meeting with the new agency to connect with another therapist now that my other therapy sessions have ended. This one will be a permanent therapist unlike the previous one. I was texting my friend and she asked me to do her a favor and so I did her the favor and then I told her I would be honest with her. I was referring to finally entrusting her with my secret, so I did the favor, sent her screenshots and then shared my notes with her, it was a suicide note I wrote about a month ago, I then went to the restroom and while I was there I got the call notification on my watch. She called me twice and she probably would have called me a third time or however many times until I picked up, I was lucky on my way out when she called the second time. I answered and I could tell she was tearing up. She thought I was about to do something and I thought she could see that it was an old note. I also didn’t give her a warning on it so my bad, but I went back and reread it and apparently I wrote it on a weekend and it’s Friday today, so I get why she thought I was about to or had done something. I cleared things up, but yeah I almost accidentally gave my best friend a heart attack. We continued to talk until I had to leave for my Catholic school classes, and then I had to go to mass, but we started texting again when I got home.

TL;DR:
TIFU by sending my best friend a su!c!de letter I wrote a month ago without warning about the contents and going to the bathroom right after sending it. While I was in the bathroom she called and I didn’t answer, so I nearly accidentally gave her a heart attack, I answered the call the second time she called me and we cleared things up, though she scolded me which I totally deserved. 

Extra Info:
I told sent the note because I talked about it with the person who interviewed me to set me up with a therapist and because it was within the last 30 days I had to form a safety contract which included setting up 3 emergency contacts. The suicidal episode that made me write the note was a one time thing, I’ve had suicidal tendencies in the past but this was the first suicidal thought I’ve had in a nearly 2 years.

,tifu,"I love my boyfriend very much. But we butt heads all the time because we often both want to be right and are desperate to be understood and do not put much effort into being understanding. This obviously means our arguments do not go toooo smoothly, but we know this and we’re trying to work on it.

He is very strait laced, doesn’t drink, smoke, go to clubs or bars. I am not like super wild, but I enjoy going out from time to time and love to get tipsy with my friends and have a nice smoke sesh from time to time. 

When we first started dating, he hated that I smoked. Even suggested he would end things with me if I continued to. So I decided to stop smoking because it wasn’t super important to me, and it obviously was for him and I just didn’t want to lose him and wanted to avoid the conflict.

Since then, we’ve talked about it more where I’ve expressed I only stopped bc he said he’d end things, and I don’t want to stop doing something I enjoy just because he has a negative perception of it. 

At this point, I was thinking that he had never been around it fr. Just grew up in a strict household in a strict place. Where for me, recreational weed use is literally the norm.

He asked me if I had smoked since our last conversation about it (where he said I could do it if I wanted, and just not to tell him), and I had so I told him yes. And he responded, he felt very disappointed in me. Obviously- I hated being told that. Like I am an adult.. I didn’t lie to him, I didn’t betray him. If I want to smoke weed once in a while, I should be able to do that without fearing my boyfriend is going to get mad at me for it.

But he finally dropped all of the lore, as to why he hates weed. He went through some family trauma with someone that was addicted to it and took advantage of his family when he was young, causing much harm.

When he told me this, I was still caught up in being told what I did was disappointing and kept asking him to just have an open mind about changing his perception, so that it didn’t hold so much power and didn’t have to be an issue between us.

Obviously, I missed a very big moment where he was telling me something he hadn’t told anyone and had a very emotional effect on him. I wish I had just put my own feelings aside and been there for him. I know I made him feel so invalidated and disregarded, which breaks my heart.

Obviously I know that my experience and relationship with weed is not at all connected to that family member, but he cannot separate the two which I understand. I literally very rarely smoke, maybe once every three months, and always socially. Even without knowing this, I of course would never have it around him. But I just hated that I wasn’t doing something I enjoyed just because he had discomfort with it, when it wasn’t something around him at all.

Now I know more, I know how deep of a thing this is for him. And I want to be there for him. I know how men feel about never sharing their feelings and when they do, how receiving a poor response can do serious harm. So I don’t know what I can do to fix how I responded to him being vulnerable with me and sharing that info when I was so caught up in my own feelings.

,tifu,"I am definitely going to delete this later, I'm posting this under my anon account for a reason. I'm just hoping that maybe there are some other people here who've done something similar or nurses that can tell me worse stories from their work to make me feel better about myself. Or at least maybe a little mockery will help turn this from a humiliating story to a funny one.

Today I had an egg retrieval operation in the hospital as part of an egg donation. This is a surgical procedure in which a needle is inserted into the vaginal wall to the ovary, collecting mature eggs to be fertilized. (While normally you only have one, injections are administered for about two weeks beforehand to increase the number of eggs matured in one cycle-- in my case there were about 25 eggs). The retrieval is done under anaesthetic, which I'm going to blame for all my poor decisions.

Everything was going swimmingly until I woke up. For about ten minutes I was totally fine. Then I felt like absolute shit. I've done this once before but it didn't hurt this bad. It felt like period pain, if you were having twenty-five particularly bad periods all at once. The cramps were so bad one of the first things I did once it hit was roll over and throw up (though that could have actually been the nausea from the anaesthetic-- I am not sure).

There was an IV in my left arm so I didn't want to curl up on my left on top of it, and I tried to curl up on my right but that left my left arm in very uncomfortable position too, so I opted to roll into the fetal position while lying on my back-- that is, with my knees lifted in the air up against my chest and my calves and feet hovering parallel to the bed. This did help with the pain a little. What I realised later when recreating this position at home later is it's very difficult to get the blanket to actually cover your backside entirely like this, and the hospital blankets were not that big, so I'm reasonably sure that in trying to alleviate my pain I was also displaying my ass and genitals to all of the attending staff-- three nurses-- and possibly others in the recovery room as well.

One of the nurses went to fetch some kind of opioid to help with the pain. While that was happening, I was acutely aware of the intense ache in my vulva and pelvis. For the men in the subreddit who are not in the know, masturbating helps with period pain, and I was still reasonably sure that the blanket was covering me entirely and nobody would know. So in my delirious state I decided to rub the offending anatomy to try and reduce the pain. One of the nurses closed the curtain surrounding me and then he told me he was going to get me a second blanket ""for warmth"". When he returned with it he placed it a little lower over my body, covering my lower body and legs. I didn't really put what this meant together until later.

To their credit, they took it very well and didn't actually say anything, and it is possible they didn't see it, but reflecting on their reactions and the chain of events in clear-eyed hindsight I'm pretty sure they did. To be fair, if any of them were present for the surgical procedure they would have seen me while I was unconscious as well, but it's a different thing when I'm awake and, well, you know.

Anyway, now I'm recovering in bed at home. The pain has went away but the embarrassment has only increased. At least I humiliated myself for a good cause, and I'll probably never see these people again.

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I picked up someones lunch at work and thought I brought my wife&amp;#39;s lunch in instead of mine, didn&amp;#39;t eat for the whole day only to find I did bring my lunch in and the lunch I picked up was my co-workers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: thanks for all the comments! I spoke with my co-worker, and he just broke out in laughter and said he thought he was going crazy. 
As for the Chicken/Tuna debate, I would always prefer chicken! but my wife chose tuna for the week and with the goal of cutting costs we eat the same for lunch each week. Unfortunately the left over chicken pasta she had there was only 1 portion left so I let her take it. &lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"TIFU. Idk how but I’ve never been able to make rice. I always fuck it up, idk how. But today; I really fucked up. I may need to throw out two pots if I can’t scrape rice from the bottom of them after they’re done soaking. 

I feel nothing but shame not only because I fucked up, but cause I spent like $15 buying curry and rice. I really have made some mistakes. I also didn’t read the curry instructions and due to that, I didn’t notice it had cumin in it. I do not like cumin. 

I am now eating shame cereal as a way to at least have dinner because honestly, I can not cook food. Maybe next time — god forbid there is a next time — I won’t fuck up the rice and I’ll buy curry I like. Maybe I’ll actually do something good for dinner. Maybe I’ll just make Mac and cheese again because I suck at cooking.

,tifu,"I feel SO BAD about this, it literally just happened. So I'm on a walk through some residential areas of town, and to my right is one of the town's main roads. No problem.

I'm just walking straight, and about to cross the road, when a lady driving on the main road turns on her blinker to turn right. She would have been cutting in front of me to turn into her neighborhood.

Instead of completing the turn though, she locks eyes with me and smiles, slows down, and decides to let me cross the street before she makes her turn. ""How nice,"" I think.

Except, BANG!!! The car behind her wasn't paying attention. He rear ends her HARD, and the front of his car crumples. The sound was insane.

,tifu,"My girlfriend (20F) and I (21M) have been together since I was 15 and she was 14. We have an excellent relationship, we've only had about four arguments in six years, and none of them were serious. I have no doubt she's the woman of my life.

Here's how the problem started: for some years, I've seen many women complaining about how frustrating it is to be a girlfriend for a long time. For example, some say ""I've been with the same man for 9 years and I'm still just a girlfriend"" and how uncomfortable they feel in that situation. I understand how bad that can be, and I wanted my girlfriend to know I take our relationship seriously. At the same time I'm far from being financially stable enough to get married, so my solution was this: I would propose now, but we'd get married in about five years. That way we could tell people we're engaged, and she wouldn’t have to be a girlfriend for 11 years before becoming a fiancée.

We're on vacation now, and yesterday I proposed to her. She was extremely happy, cried a lot, and I was happy and cried too. But when we got back to the hotel, she asked me how I wanted the wedding to be. I told her ""I don't think it's worth planning the wedding now since we're only getting married in about five years."" She instantly got sad and went to the bathroom for a few minutes. I apologized to her, but she was not talking to me (when she's extremely sad she usually stays completely silent). After some time she said she wanted to talk about it on Friday, that it was okay, and she wanted to enjoy the rest of our vacation.

It's clearly not okay I shouldn't have done this. I thought she would be happy and understand my point of view (which we still haven’t talked about yet because I'm respecting her space), but now I think I tried to fix a problem that didn’t exist and ended up hurting her. Looking back she never complained about being a girlfriend for six years, I don't know why I thought this was necessary.



  
**UPDATE:** I followed the advice from the comments, and it was really just a communication problem. Earlier today, we talked about it. I explained what my idea was and showed her this post. She laughed about it and said that doing this suits my character, lol. She said she wouldn’t mind being my girlfriend for 10 years because we are still young and it didn’t matter to her. She mentioned that I could have explained my idea to her before proposing, but in the end it was fine and she said it was cute that I thought about doing this.

I apologized a million times, and we decided together that I’ll propose to her again in a few years, and the wedding will happen a year after the proposal, like a normal couple. She’ll wear the ring I gave her because she liked it, and if someone asks us about our relationship, we’ll say that we’re getting married soon.

Now, addressing some things I’ve seen in the comments: it’s important to me that we have a wedding (ceremony), but we are definitely going to live in the same house before our wedding. This year, I’ve stabilized myself in a situation which I believe the best way to explain to an American is: you're making $120k a year but instead of living in NYC, you live in a medium-sized city where the cost of an excellent life is $5k a month. So we’re definitely moving in together early next year, but our wedding will have to wait a little longer.

Some people thought I proposed but didn’t want to get married (and that’s my fault for communicating poorly). I do want to get married, I just don’t think it’s possible right now. We both would rather move in together before having our wedding (we’ve talked about it). Another clarification is that, for me, getting married means having the wedding, not moving in together. She thought I meant we wouldn't move in for another 5 years, which isn't the case. again, my fault for not explaining it well.

Thanks for all the comments!

**TL;DR:** I asked my girlfriend to marry me but I only wanted to get married in 5 years and I ended up hurting her feelings.",t2_dvksz76j,False,,0,False,TIFU by proposing to my girlfriend in the wrong way.,[],r/tifu,False,7,M,0,,False,t3_1fvggr3,False,light,0.88,,public,789,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},M,False,789,,False,False,,1728068432.0,,[],{},,True,,2024-10-03 19:48:03,text,7,,,text,self.tifu,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend (20F) and I (21M) have been together since I was 15 and she was 14. We have an excellent relationship, we&amp;#39;ve only had about four arguments in six years, and none of them were serious. I have no doubt she&amp;#39;s the woman of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how the problem started: for some years, I&amp;#39;ve seen many women complaining about how frustrating it is to be a girlfriend for a long time. For example, some say &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been with the same man for 9 years and I&amp;#39;m still just a girlfriend&amp;quot; and how uncomfortable they feel in that situation. I understand how bad that can be, and I wanted my girlfriend to know I take our relationship seriously. At the same time I&amp;#39;m far from being financially stable enough to get married, so my solution was this: I would propose now, but we&amp;#39;d get married in about five years. That way we could tell people we&amp;#39;re engaged, and she wouldn’t have to be a girlfriend for 11 years before becoming a fiancée.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re on vacation now, and yesterday I proposed to her. She was extremely happy, cried a lot, and I was happy and cried too. But when we got back to the hotel, she asked me how I wanted the wedding to be. I told her &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s worth planning the wedding now since we&amp;#39;re only getting married in about five years.&amp;quot; She instantly got sad and went to the bathroom for a few minutes. I apologized to her, but she was not talking to me (when she&amp;#39;s extremely sad she usually stays completely silent). After some time she said she wanted to talk about it on Friday, that it was okay, and she wanted to enjoy the rest of our vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s clearly not okay I shouldn&amp;#39;t have done this. I thought she would be happy and understand my point of view (which we still haven’t talked about yet because I&amp;#39;m respecting her space), but now I think I tried to fix a problem that didn’t exist and ended up hurting her. Looking back she never complained about being a girlfriend for six years, I don&amp;#39;t know why I thought this was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; I followed the advice from the comments, and it was really just a communication problem. Earlier today, we talked about it. I explained what my idea was and showed her this post. She laughed about it and said that doing this suits my character, lol. She said she wouldn’t mind being my girlfriend for 10 years because we are still young and it didn’t matter to her. She mentioned that I could have explained my idea to her before proposing, but in the end it was fine and she said it was cute that I thought about doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologized a million times, and we decided together that I’ll propose to her again in a few years, and the wedding will happen a year after the proposal, like a normal couple. She’ll wear the ring I gave her because she liked it, and if someone asks us about our relationship, we’ll say that we’re getting married soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, addressing some things I’ve seen in the comments: it’s important to me that we have a wedding (ceremony), but we are definitely going to live in the same house before our wedding. This year, I’ve stabilized myself in a situation which I believe the best way to explain to an American is: you&amp;#39;re making $120k a year but instead of living in NYC, you live in a medium-sized city where the cost of an excellent life is $5k a month. So we’re definitely moving in together early next year, but our wedding will have to wait a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"For some context, I moved into student accommodation about a month ago. My shared kitchen has a fan oven with multiple different settings, while I am used to using a gas oven where all you really control is the temperature. I didn't really know what all of the separate settings do, so I'd just turn on any that heats up the oven and works for what I'm making. 

I decided to try and bake some apples with sugar and cinnamon, and the recipe said that it must be covered in tinfoil while it's baking. I didn't have any but I had parchment paper so I figured that that must be fine and I didn't want to go out and buy tinfoil (the nearest shop is 20 minutes away and I didn't really have the time, + I just couldn't be bothered). Parchment paper is usually very safe to use in the oven as well, and at home there was 0 risk and that's what I was used to, so I didn't really think too much about it. 

It went swimmingly for most of the time the apples were in the oven, until I opened the oven and slightly adjusted the parchment paper to better observe the state of the apples, when all of a sudden it caught on fire. At that point I was just confused and scared, I wasn't aware it was possible to start a fire in the oven with parchment paper, and naturally there was a risk the fire would spread. One of my two flatmates who was there at the time started pouring water into the baking tray, and the other flatmate went to open windows and doors while I took the tray out of the oven and ran it under the water to put out the flames. All I was left with were some apples with a goopy, undercooked topping, surrounded by the charred remains of the parchment paper. 

It turned out that I had turned on the fan and grill setting, and the parchment paper must have touched the grill above it, which then started the fire. So yeah, I won't try baking again any time soon.

,tifu,"TL;DR I may have missed a massive customer who signed up for my service offering over 2 months ago with high urgency. I didn't check my signups Google Form in months and the notifications were turned off as they are by default.

For some context, I'm a solopreneur doing AWS cost optimization as a service, and a while back I made a Google Forms to allow people to sign up for my services.

I only had very little volume on it (4 responses in about a year), since most of my customers so far came from my LinkedIn.

The first two signups were very small and didn't worth pursuing (they were in the low $1000s/month, my ideal customers start from $10k monthly).

I just wrapped up at my last customer and thought to have a look at my signup Google Form after many months, now that someone recently wrote me on LinkedIn that they recently signed up for this.

Turns out another massive AWS customer spending over $10MM/month signed up back in July for my services, with high emergency, and I completely missed them.

The form notifications were disabled and I didn't check the form for months. 🤦🏻‍♂️

I wrote them an email but it's already been over 2 months so they probably found someone else in the meantime considering it was a high emergency situation for them.

Later edit: they answered my email and booked a call for next week 😎

&lt;p&gt;My wife does not. I guess that&amp;#39;s where the conflict stems from. I&amp;#39;ve got every reason to be happy, and I mostly am. But when I&amp;#39;m alone and it&amp;#39;s quiet, I guess I&amp;#39;m not. And then I drink &amp;#39;til I feel nothing. Then she gets home from a twelve hour shift to a dopey, drunk sonuvabitch she was dumb enough to marry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate being this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I guess I&amp;#39;m trying to reconcile the call of the void with living a happy life. And I&amp;#39;m an alcoholic. &lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"This happened awhile ago but it's worth sharing if it brightens someone's day. 

My husband and I were flying from the UK to Canada via Gatwick with our then 4 year old twin girls. 

All was good, we were just chilling in the little family area in the middle of the airport before going to our gate. One of the twins needed to go to the bathroom so I left my husband with the bags and one of the kids while I took the other to the bathroom. 

But the women's bathroom line was HUGE. My daughter couldn't wait, she really had to go and was doing the pee dance beside me. I checked the disabled toilet but it was locked, no luck. 

I rush back to the family area and tell my husband that the women's bathroom is too busy and she can't hold it, he'll have to take her. 

No problem, off they go down the airport to the men's room and I settle down with our other daughter and all of our bags to wait for them. 

I wasn't waiting very long when I hear a commotion down the terminal and my husband goes SPRINTING past me, daughter over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes, yelling ""GET THE BAGS!!! GET THE BAAAAAGS!!"" 

Our flight isn't even boarding for another hour, and now I'm in a full panic wondering what in the world is happening. I grab our daughter and all of our bags and start hustling down to our gate to find the two of them just sitting there in wide-eyed silence. 

Me: what the hell happened??

Him: We went to the men's bathroom but it was also really busy and all of the stalls were full

Me: so??

Him: well she really, really had to go

Me: yeah?

Him: so I had to do what I had to do

Me: which was?

Him: I pulled her pants down, picked her up in a sitting position and backed her over the urinal so she could pee

Me: okay that's funny, but it's not that bad

Him: it wasn't that bad until she started pushing.

And this is why we are never again returning to Gatwick.😅

So it's not what you're thinking. They're not that kind of special. To give a little back story, my wife and I have been trying to eat healthier lately, tracking our calories and protein and vitamins, minerals, all that. Over the last few weeks, we've realized that, on a good day, we get maybe 15 to 20 grams of fiber, despite eating vegetables and fruit with at least 2 of our meals. So we've been dedicating extra attention to upping our fiber intake, and now we're getting at least 20, sometime up to 40 grams a day. 

So, today, I come home and my wife is sitting on the couch. I go into the kitchen, and there is almost a whole 9×13 pan of brownies sitting on the counter. I ask if she's saving them. She says no. I ask if I can have some. She says ""of course baby, eat as much as you want, they're healthy."" That was all I needed to hear. I grab one and start eating it. It's a little dry, texture is a little off, but it's not bad. I start on dinner, eat another one. At this point, I think it's important to say that the hardest part of keeping my calorie intake down is I snack if given the opportunity. Not bad when it's carrots or cherry tomatoes, but if there's sweets, they have to be out of sight or I'll find myself just grabbing and eating without thinking about it. A bad habit from when I quit smoking and snacked to keep my mouth busy, I guess. 

As I finish cooking, I realize I've eaten five of these brownies. So, I do the logical thing and grab a sixth, eating it as I walk of the living room to tell my dear wife, who said to eat as many as I want, that I might have to make her some more brownie and I'll need the recipe for her healthy browned. She gets a confused look on her face, followed quickly by concern, and replaced almost immediate with amusement. 
""Honey,"" she says, ""how many brownies did you eat?"" 
""Six,"" I say, after swallowing the last bite, slightly apprehensive at her poorly concealed amusement. ""Why, is something wrong?""
""Well that depends on your time frame for wrong, honestly. Right now, no, nothing is wrong in 30 minutes to an hour? Maybe.""

At this point, I'm beginning to get concerned, and she, thankfully, didn't keep me waiting for long on the reason for her amusement. 
""I didn't make those brownies. My coworker did. I told her about us needing more fiber and she said she had the perfect recipe. Each one of those brownies is supposed to have about 7 grams of fiber in them, and you ate 6 of them.""

At this point, I knew I had made a horrible, horrible mistake, but I tried to reason with myself. Maybe I've been getting enough fiber that it won't be like the time I jumped from almost no fiber to eating a fiber 1 bar with an Olli pop with my lunch and painted my backside with blue porta potty water 45 minutes later. Maybe it won't be so bad, besides, how could 1 brownie have 7 grams of fiber? They weren't amazing, but they were better than the fiber brownies you get at the store. Alas, my hope was for naught. No sooner had I finished dinner, and my stomach rumbled in a way that spoke of the horrors to come. Immediately, I made haste to the porcelain throne, yelling to my wife that she would have to serve dinner tonight. No sooner had I taken my seat that the floodgates were blown wide open. I'll spare you the details, but suffice is to say that I was seated on my throne for over an hour, and needed a shower after. 

Suffice is to say, my rear is tired, the bathroom still smells of my regret, and my wife can't look at me without chuckling and has made it known she will be telling the evil person who made the brownies about how well they worked on her poor, unsuspecting husband. I will be asking how healthy these random snacks are from now on.


TL;DR, in an attempt to get more fiber, my wife's coworker made brownies with 7 grams of fiber and I ate 6 not knowing, and paid the price for it.

,tifu,"Obligatory - this happened at the weekend, not today. 

Okay, so everyone knows cats and water don't mix. My cat, Winston, is basically the feline embodiment of hydrophobic terror.  He avoids puddles, glares at the rain, and sprints away from the sink like it's filled with lava. But Winston also has this annoying habit of rolling around in the dirtiest places imaginable. Today, he chose the potted plant that I may have forgotten to clean up after my latest repotting adventure. Let's just say it involved a significant amount of soil.
Naturally, Winston emerged looking like a tiny, furry coal miner. There was dirt in his fur, dirt on his paws, probably dirt in his nose (judging by the sneezing). A bath was unavoidable.

Now, I'm not a monster. I wasn't about to dunk him in a tub full of water.  Instead, I had this brilliant idea: a gentle rinse with the shower head! It seemed logical. Controlled water stream, nice and warm, what could go wrong?

Famous 

last 

words.


I lured Winston into the bathroom with the promise of tuna (bribery is key, people) and turned on the shower to a trickle. The moment he saw the water, his eyes widened in horror. He launched himself at the shower curtain, becoming instantly entangled. He then proceeded to scale me like a furry, clawing ladder, leaving a trail of muddy paw prints across my chest and face.

Meanwhile, the shower head, neglected in the chaos, had decided to go rogue. The gentle trickle became a powerful jet, soaking the entire bathroom.  Winston, now perched on my head, looked like a drowned rat who'd just survived a hurricane.

Finally, I managed to wrestle him free and wrap him in a towel. He's currently sulking under the bed, plotting his revenge, I'm sure.  The bathroom looks like a swamp monster threw a tantrum in it. And I smell faintly of tuna and potting soil.


TL;DR: Tried to give my cat a civilized shower. Ended up with a flooded bathroom, a traumatized cat, and a newfound appreciation for professional groomers.

&lt;p&gt;I lured Winston into the bathroom with the promise of tuna (bribery is key, people) and turned on the shower to a trickle. The moment he saw the water, his eyes widened in horror. He launched himself at the shower curtain, becoming instantly entangled. He then proceeded to scale me like a furry, clawing ladder, leaving a trail of muddy paw prints across my chest and face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the shower head, neglected in the chaos, had decided to go rogue. The gentle trickle became a powerful jet, soaking the entire bathroom.  Winston, now perched on my head, looked like a drowned rat who&amp;#39;d just survived a hurricane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I managed to wrestle him free and wrap him in a towel. He&amp;#39;s currently sulking under the bed, plotting his revenge, I&amp;#39;m sure.  The bathroom looks like a swamp monster threw a tantrum in it. And I smell faintly of tuna and potting soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Tried to give my cat a civilized shower. Ended up with a flooded bathroom, a traumatized cat, and a newfound appreciation for professional groomers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: clearly should have made my title say &amp;quot;pussy&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;cat&amp;quot; for the updoots&lt;/p&gt;

I packed my bag last night, doubled checked I had everything I needed. I deliberately put my presentation script next to my bed so I could read it again in the morning.

It’s all a blur. I think I did okay, I had memorised it as much as I could but two years worth of work down the drain… please excuse me while I go and drink a large quantity of alcohol. Sigh.

,tifu,"

I trusted someone online, specifically on Reddit, and it ended poorly. I came across a post by u/Onlyxeddy, who was selling a retro PlayStation 2 console. I thought it would be great for my son to experience the classic games I grew up with, so I decided to buy it. I sent the payment through Venmo, but despite repeated promises, the seller hasn’t provided any proof of shipment. All I’ve gotten are excuses about how busy he is.

Looking back, I realize that I was too trusting, and it frustrates me how easily I fall into that trap. It’s hard not to feel foolish for believing someone without any real verification. I’ve learned a harsh lesson: I won’t be sending money to strangers on the internet again, no matter how appealing the offer may be. From now on, I’ll stick to reputable websites and platforms that offer more security.

I can’t help but feel deeply disappointed in myself. I worked hard to save that money, and now it’s likely gone to someone who just took advantage of my trust. It’s disheartening to realize how people can be so deceptive. As much as I want to believe in the goodness of others, this experience reminds me that there are always risks, especially online.

It’s difficult not to spiral into negative thinking. Mistakes like this make me question my own judgment, and with my struggle with depression, it’s even harder to deal with. I know I shouldn’t let this one situation drag me down so much, but in moments like this, it feels overwhelming. I understand that setbacks happen, but I need to remind myself that one bad experience doesn’t define my worth or my ability to move forward. Moments like this makes me feel like I don’t deserve to be in this cruel world. I hate myself for doing this.

I’m already being downvoted, that’s fine. I deserve that for being such an idiot. 

Update 10/14: I have not received the package. No response from the seller. No refund issued.

I thought the picture was neat so I jokingly responded with essentially ""Pretty neat John Doe age 30"". 

I didn't think there was a problem with this because he shared the information willingly and nobody else did either because I was top post but one reddit user started making a stink about how I needed to delete my comment because it was the right thing to do. Even though I thought it was silly I deleted it anyways to make him happy since it was just a stupid joke. Eventually the picture got removed by the moderators (the moderators apparently had a bigger problem with this guy sharing his personal information than he did himself).

It also begs the question if all the other people in the thread pointing out the personal information in the picture got banned too or if I just got banned because instead of telling everyone exactly where to look in the picture to get that information I just used it as part of a joke.

,tifu,"See edits below for answers to some FAQs

I (26 F) and my husband (28 M) have been married for 5 years and have known that him about that long as well. Before I get into this let me give a little backstory because it provides some necessary context. We both grew up in a high demand religion with a very intense purity culture. It is not uncommon in the culture of our religion to marry young and fast, and start having kids right away. We unfortunately fit right into that stereotype. We were just two horny young people who dove head in and there was no one around us telling us no. The last five years haven’t been easy but we do genuinely love each other and have both put in a lot of effort to make it work and this last year especially has been a good year for us. 

I mention the above because part of what we’ve been working on is being more affectionate and intimate with each other. So we were in bed and we were just having some pillow talk, telling each other things that we liked about each other. At one point I told him that I thought about him all the time when he’s gone for work (works a very demanding job, with overnight 12.5 hour shifts), how handsome I think he is and how much I miss him.

Here’s  where I fuck up- I also tell him I think about him when I touch myself and imagine that it’s him. He looks at me and looks away and is CLEARLY uncomfortable. He says “Oh”. 
And I’m like… “oh? What’s wrong? Does that make you uncomfortable?”
And he says that it caught him off guard and he is a little uncomfortable.
Y’all I was shaking in my boots. I’m like “you are my husband. I have two children with you. We’ve been married and have been having sex for 5 years. Why on gods earth would it make you uncomfortable to know that your wife thinks of you in moments of private?”
All he had to say to that was that it just surprised him. I pushed for more details but admittedly I probably sounded upset (because I was), he got defensive, so I just dropped it because I honestly don’t even know what to say. 

I should’ve known it would go down like this. This man absolutely refuses to talk about sex outside the act itself. Will not sext, will not flirt, NOTHING, which is a complete 180 from when we were dating/engaged. It’s been a thing I’ve tried to respect but also have had to talk him about and remind him that I’m his wife not his best buddy, thus us working on affection and intimacy with one another. I don’t know if the purity culture has just screwed with him and created a mental block in his head regarding sex, I don’t know if it’s related to me and how he feels about me. I genuinely don’t know and I honestly don’t know if he knows either. 

Anyway I’m up and still thinking about it, I went to bed shortly after that conversation, just feeling really disappointed and somewhat rejected in a way. What I do know is that his reaction has definitely ruined my own “private time” with myself because if he pops up in my head during it, I’ll just remember what he said and it will totally kill the mood. Not sure if I even feel like I want to be physically intimate with him anytime soon either after that. I don’t know but hours later I’m still cringing on the inside thinking about this. Reddit if you’ve been in this position, mine or his, please let me know and give me some insight!

TL;DR: I told my husband I think about him during my own “intimate moments” and his reaction ruined it probably for the rest of my life. 

EDIT I addressed these in the comments but thought I’d put it up here for all to see-

1. Yes we both grew up Mormon, no we are not Mormon anymore and have not been for a few years now 

2. We both have our “private time” and we are okay with each other doing. We are also okay with each other watching porn as well. I also know for a fact that my husband doesn’t do it often as he’s monitored constantly at work and then at home he’s always with us and usually falls asleep before me, so I don’t think those are the root of the problem here. 

3. It became very clear early on in our marriage that I have a high libido and he has a low one, so we’ve had to navigate through that and haven’t always done it well.

&lt;p&gt;I (26 F) and my husband (28 M) have been married for 5 years and have known that him about that long as well. Before I get into this let me give a little backstory because it provides some necessary context. We both grew up in a high demand religion with a very intense purity culture. It is not uncommon in the culture of our religion to marry young and fast, and start having kids right away. We unfortunately fit right into that stereotype. We were just two horny young people who dove head in and there was no one around us telling us no. The last five years haven’t been easy but we do genuinely love each other and have both put in a lot of effort to make it work and this last year especially has been a good year for us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mention the above because part of what we’ve been working on is being more affectionate and intimate with each other. So we were in bed and we were just having some pillow talk, telling each other things that we liked about each other. At one point I told him that I thought about him all the time when he’s gone for work (works a very demanding job, with overnight 12.5 hour shifts), how handsome I think he is and how much I miss him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s  where I fuck up- I also tell him I think about him when I touch myself and imagine that it’s him. He looks at me and looks away and is CLEARLY uncomfortable. He says “Oh”. 
And I’m like… “oh? What’s wrong? Does that make you uncomfortable?”
And he says that it caught him off guard and he is a little uncomfortable.

,tifu,"But of background: Me 20 M and my girlfriend 20 F have been seeing each other for over a year. Met at uni did a similar degree and so forth. She lives on campus whilst I still live with my parents. 

This event happened last week when I saw a tiktok saying prank your friends with a service that anonymously informs them by text that some one you’ve slept with recently has tested positive for Chlamydia and you should get tested.

Seeing this tiktok I decided haha that would be funny I decided to put in my Gf’s number and send her a text thinking nothing but a harmless prank of it.

I then recieved a call from her sobbing saying that she needs to go to the doctor and will not tell me what for. 

Thinking nothing if the strange coincidence I decide maybe she’s injured or suck as she has been very sick in the past so I take her to the doctor where I have to sit outside the whole time.

After her appointment she comes back in a better mood and is saying it was just a false alarm and refuses to answer any questions about it.

Concerned that she has a medical problem I don’t know about, I ask her best friend who I happened to be very close to. That reveals to me that she was tested for STD’s as she got a text saying a sexual partner she had slept with got one. 

The friend then puts the very large pieces together (not the brightest) that this means she has cheated on me.

I go home and confront her about it saying I was the one that sent the text, and she gets angry at me for sending it and making her worry.

,tifu,"This happened years ago but I still cringe so bad about this and use it as a healthy check against any delusions of genius/intelligence within myself. 

I used to drive quite frequently between my state and my parents’, necessitating long stretches of highway, and in my moral musings as a new parent tired and weary with content deprivation, became quite shrewd about recognizing distracted drivers around me, finding reasons to become disgusted with my fellow humans’ on-road attention integrity deficit, going so far as to give a good scowl at the worst offenders if I could manage a safe dirty look.

Then, one day, I was more tired than ever, exhausted by life in that new mom way, driving the 3.5 hours home. it was sorta dusky out, moody clouds overhanging the smoggy city interlude threaded with lanes of varying high speed commuters — and this poor visibility, I presume, compounded by my foggy brain, catalyzed my next ocular error: that the car behind me sped on at the expense of a distracted operator!!!

I eyed the grey sedan suspiciously, and inside me a flaming rage for safety and moral community justice roared, in place of logical reassessments; the girl I saw in my rearview gaze was not even *looking* at the road! Every spell she texted for a profoundly long time, as I could ascertain with my frequent checks, growing angrier each time I beheld the face on the driver’s side of the car not even remotely interested in looking at her lethal weapon’s course as she set pace in my wake. How dare she text and scroll with such cavalier disinterest in her roadworthiness!!!!

I was astonished, appalled, and outraged by this bold and illicit behavior, and as it continued, I was DETERMINED to show my rage at this rejection of all that is good and safe in the world in this motorist’s behavior. I started glowering ragefully at them, shaking my head and throwing my hands enough to be noticed — and they eventually peeled off.

When I looked over, finally outside of the mirror, at this passing lone sinner, and began shaking my head with a perfectly disgusted face to show my outrage — I saw the texting woman in the passenger seat… past the outline of a Black gentleman whose skin color had enabled him to blend into the dark seats in my eyesight, who was properly seated in the driver’s seat, no phone in sight — and he was looking at me with an expression I’ve never seen before or since that curdled into my angry visage into one cringing embarrassment: something akin to bemusement, confusion, pity, and being deeply disturbed, all at once. But mostly, his eyes radiated a hurt I’ll never forget — that I was showing hate to HIM for no reason, blatantly and directly, in a road rage way, purely dehumanizing him, and he had done NOTHING TO DESERVE IT. That head-shake he returned me, and the wounded/disgusted way he beheld me as some venomous psycho aggressor — will stay with me til the day I die.  

TL;DR I watched the car behind me in the rearview mirror at what I thought was a distracted driver, but the driver’s side and passenger side are swapped in a mirror image; the actual attentive driver, whose melanin made him “disappear” in my view, was actually the undeserving recipient of my glowering fist shaking feedback  ",t2_zhoys,False,,0,False,TIFU by getting confused and angry with a perceived distracted driver ,[],r/tifu,False,7,M,0,,False,t3_1fu4gd8,False,light,0.38,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},M,False,0,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,2024-10-02 01:14:11,text,7,,,text,self.tifu,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happened years ago but I still cringe so bad about this and use it as a healthy check against any delusions of genius/intelligence within myself. &lt;/p&gt;

He mentioned that he and my fellow manager just realized they share a birthday. I said ""oh wow, what day is that?"", he says ""I'll give you a hint, you will never forget it!""

I akwardly said ""9/11? It's not September 11th is it?"" He covered his mouth and slowly said ""nooo."" ""It's November 11th...""

November 11th is Remembrance Day in Canada... the slogan is lest we forget...

I played it off by immediately saying ""oh wow, my birthday is in November too."" Which is true but woof.... way to make an impression...

,tifu,"So this actually happened over 2 years ago while my mom and I were in Paris. I was 18 at the time and had just graduated from high school. Since I graduated with my Associates Degree at the same time by taking dual enrollment classes in high school, my mom put together a special trip for the two of us to go to Paris for a week as my ""double graduation"" gift.  
  
Cut to night 1 of the trip and I’m absolutely blowing up the bathroom after holding it in all day (hot girls have stomach issues, amiright?). I lost count of the amount of times I flushed the toilet after the eighth flush. I went through almost an entire roll of shitty ass hotel toilet paper in one sitting. The rest was a blur until I was finally done. Then, after the last flush, the toilet bowl water started bubbling rhythmically. Three bubbles. Blub… blub… blub. I pass it off as nothing to worry about and go about my day.  
  
Day 2: the bubbling is still there. Blub. Blub. Blub.   
  
Day 3: It’s happening quite regularly now, probably at a frequency of once every other minute. My mom and I were a little concerned, but passed it off yet again because we thought it would just go away… Famous last words.  
  
Day 4: The next morning, I wake up to a horrendous odor and my mom calling for me from the bathroom. While we were asleep, the toilet overflowed and FLOODED our hotel room with poo water. That's right, poo water \[insert Bee Movie reference here\]. The whole room reeked and the carpet was damp. We had to wear shoes inside the hotel room for fear of getting anything on our socks or bare feet. My mom, like the trooper she is, cleaned up as much of the mess as she could using the towels we had in the bathroom. The floor was still covered in shit and sewage, though, so she called the concierge to let them know about the situation, then sent me to go grab more towels from them. After I brought the extra towels, we mopped up as much as we could before we got dressed and ready for our plans that day. By the time we were almost ready to leave, we heard a knock at the door. It was the plumber.  
  
The plumber didn't speak much English but the concierge had already given him the run-down of the situation. We let him in and when he rounded the corner to see the bathroom and get a full whiff of the stench, he exclaimed what I can only assume was some curse in French. After around five minutes of attempting to plunge the toilet, he realized he didn't have all of the tools he needed.   
  
This is my mom's favorite part: When he came back out of the bathroom, he looked at us and WAGGED HIS FINGER while repeating, ""No... no... no good... no..."" before leaving the room to go get more supplies from his vehicle. At this point, my mom and I were ready to go, so we left to get breakfast at a cafe that was about a 20-minute Uber ride from the hotel. We explored the surrounding area for a bit before Uber-ing back to the hotel.  
  
When we got back, the door to our room was propped open. The plumber was not alone. Two other men were now in our hotel room trying to fix the toilet. The craziest part? They had to \*remove the toilet from the wall\* because it was that bad. We didn't plan on staying for long, we just had to get changed into nicer clothes to go to a restaurant we had made a reservation for that was more upscale than our casual clothes would allow. We grabbed our change of clothes, got changed in the lobby bathroom, then dropped off our things in the room before heading off to lunch.  
  
Fast forward a couple of hours later: The three men are still there and the toilet is still off the wall. They gave us a rough estimate of when they would be done, which was probably going to be another 2-3 hours. During this exchange, they all kept shooting glances at us that were a mix of disgust and befuddlement. I can only imagine they were talking amongst themselves throughout the day saying things like, ""Ugh, these Americans and their bowels,"" and, ""What the actual fuck did those women EAT?"" We told them that the wait was completely fine, thanked them, and apologized profusely. When we got in the elevator, out of earshot, we burst out laughing because of how insane the whole thing was. We're like children when it comes to poop/fart jokes, so even though this was a serious issue and we felt really bad for the plumbers, we still thought it was absolutely hilarious.  
  
We had about an hour and a half to kill before we had to leave for our reservations at Versailles, so we decided to go for a walk to a quaint little bakery nearby that had some tarts we wanted to try, then brought our tarts back to the lobby where we sat for the next hour. Long story short, we returned at around 7:30 pm and were informed the room wasn't quite ready yet as it was being cleaned and were told to return in about an hour. We thanked the concierge, apologized for the trouble, then went to grab a late dinner down the street.  
  
Unfortunately, when we got back to the room later that night, the shit smell lingered. We put two and two together and figured the plumbers had to have been there for at least 6 hours of the day from start to finish, given the first guy had arrived at around 10:00 am and they had to have all left between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm. We were still reeling from the whole situation and couldn't help but burst out laughing for what seemed like the 50th time that day. After that, we made a rule that courtesy flushes were a must after two wipes so we wouldn't run the risk of clogging or damaging the frail little toilet again.  
  
Since then, this has probably been the funniest personal story I've ever told. We're going back to Paris in a couple of months AND we're staying at the same hotel, so hopefully I won't repeat the same mistake this time lol.  
  
TLDR: If you've ever wondered, ""How many Frenchmen does it take to fix a toilet?"" The answer is 3.",t2_ca345za3,False,,0,False,TIFU When I Broke a Toilet in Paris with My Monstrous Shit,[],r/tifu,False,7,L,0,,False,t3_1ftz6ka,False,light,0.41,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},L,False,0,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,2024-10-01 21:08:54,text,7,,,text,self.tifu,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this actually happened over 2 years ago while my mom and I were in Paris.

,tifu,"This was a few weeks ago. I (28M) am visiting my (non English speaking) grandfather for the weekend and get to his place pretty late in the evening. After going through my things I realize that I don't have my toothbrush, so I ask my grandfather for one, and he replies that he may have an extra.

We both go into the bathroom and he starts looking through his cabinets for a brush. He finds one toothbrush he claims is mine, which clearly hasn't been used since I was a child because it is COVERED in dust. We throw it away. He keeps looking but can only find brush heads for a sonic toothbrush (like OralB) that he no longer owns. So we look for something to stick the brush head into. This is where the FU happens.

We're both digging through the drawers looking for a base for the brush head and while he's exploring I find a thing plastic stick with a bunch of tiny holes on one end and a screw base on the other, the hole in the screw base is a perfect fit for the base of the brush head. So I'm handling this little thing wondering what it is, and then as it dawns on me that the shape is familiar a sense of dread creeps in and I ask my grandfather ""What is this?""

He looks up and with a perplexed expression answers ""It's my клизма.""

I don't know what a клизма is but I can guess, and disgust in my voice I ask one more time ""... Grandpa... Does this go up your butt?"" and he reassures me that it doesn't. Eventually we find a brush and I thoroughly wash my hands.

So, I’m a psychology student staying at my grandparents’ place during the week because I live a couple hours away from my university. Tomorrow, I have a midterm for my Human Sexuality course, and last night I tried to print my study notes. The printer, being the temperamental monster it is, just wouldn’t cooperate, so I went to bed, figuring I’d try again in the morning.

Fast forward to this morning. My grandpa, bless his soul, wanted to print out his peach pie recipe. Innocent enough. But instead of warm, delicious pie instructions, the printer spewed out 40 pages of penis and vagina diagrams. That’s right. Not just one copy, but TWO. Eighty glorious pages of diagrams and notes on the clitoris, ejaculation, erections, and yes, even anal penetration.

Grandpa, confused and horrified, stood there as if he’d accidentally unlocked the gates of sexual education hell.

I walk into the room and see him holding the papers with wide eyes. After what felt like an eternity, he simply looks at me and says, “Well… that’s not what I was expecting to bake this morning.”

I have never wanted to disappear into the floor more than at that moment.

,tifu,"Obligatory: not today, but the mistake is once again on my mind.  

About two years ago, I went to northern California with my named beneficiary. We hiked along the coast and among the redwoods. It was lovely -- beautiful rugged coast, tall trees, faint aroma of barbecued Ewok.

A few days after we got back, I developed a rash on my face and wrist. One of my eyes swelled nearly shut. I get contact dermatitis from Tide and other products, so I figured it was an allergic reaction. I tried to medicate with Benadryl and cortisone cream, but it kept spreading.

After a few days of intense discomfort, I went to see a nurse practitioner. She said, ""That's poison ivy."" I told her that was not possible, because I had not been anywhere outdoors for a couple of weeks... except California, but the rash started a few days *after* I got home. She said, ""Well, then it's poison oak. It can persist on clothing for weeks."" 

I got the poison ivy soap. I got the poison ivy spray. I took repeated scalding showers and applied goo liberally. My face got better quickly, but my wrist stayed bad and then my left ankle and right calf got horrifically itchy. It was not like burning or pain, it was just an urgent need to scratch and it was *always* there. I realized I was 'reinfecting' myself. 

I can't be 100% sure, but I think I must have brushed a piece of clothing against poison oak while on our hike. I then managed to take the item off without contacting the urushiol, and then put it in my dirty clothes bag and brought it home to launder. I then washed that laundry in cold water, because that's good for the clothes and the environment.

But cold water and detergent do nothing to urushiol. It's an oil. It does not dissolve in cold water. Tumbling clothes around and around together in a warm dryer does give urushiol plenty opportunity to spread. Every single item of clothing in that load was exposed, and by the time I realized what happened, they had all been folded and put away. 

I collected every possible item of clothing that had been on that trip or had been touched by an item in that trip -- probably 70% of my casual wardrobe, in four or five loads -- and ran all of it through the washing machine twice on 'hot'. I wrecked some wool socks, but honestly I couldn't bear the thought of putting them back on, knowing they might be contaminated. Slowly, the rash got better, though my right calf was the last to stop itching weeks later. 

So okay, lesson learned, that's all behind me -- right? Except any time my right calf gets itchy -- sunburn, mosquito bite -- the whole thing gets itchy just like the poison oak. I got a mosquito bite on that calf in the last few days, nearly two years since the trip, and again the whole calf is itchy. I can treat it with OTC creams, but it's still a huge annoyance. 

It's great to wash your clothes on the cold setting. They last longer! So does the planet! 

But if you're out where you might be exposed to poison oak or poison ivy, wash your clothes with warm or hot water when you get home. You won't give half a fart about the saving the environment after you've spent two weeks trying to scrape it out from underneath your skin. 

I do still love the environment, but I'm also really glad washed all my underwear on the normal environment-destroying warm temperature after that trip. If my man parts had itched as much as my calf did back then, I would have lost my mind. 

TL;DR I washed clothes exposed to poison oak in cold water, thus spreading the poison to an entire load of clothing.

,tifu,"Yesterday, after a trip to urgent care (I had an allergic reaction, but that’s unrelated), I went to Kroger to grab some much-needed groceries. As I entered, I passed a group of Boy Scouts selling popcorn and politely declined. After shopping, I exited the store and, once again, politely declined their offer while walking toward my car.

Once at my car, I unloaded my groceries and then walked 50 feet back to the Boy Scouts, despite already saying no twice. I felt guilty about them not making any sales, and I remembered my time as a Girl Scout, so I asked for flavor recommendations.

Two boys, clearly in a mini competition, suggested different unique flavors. I prefer classic movie theater butter popcorn, which I haven’t bought in over a year since I have a strict grocery budget and don’t usually crave a whole bag of popcorn. But not wanting to pick sides, I awkwardly said, “I’ll just take both!” I remember selling Girl Scout Samoas and Thin Mints for $2.50 about 20 years ago, and I guessed these bags were probably around $9 each. Lol. 

One of the boys pulled out a card reader and swiped my card without me asking the price. They were just chatting and laughing. When the total popped up, I realized I’d just spent $45 on two tiny bags of popcorn. I felt ridiculous for not backing out, but I paid and walked away, feeling defeated.

So yeah, I’m out $45, and I don’t even like popcorn enough to justify the price! AND I said no twice - although they likely didn’t remember. 

TL;DR: I said no to Boy Scouts selling popcorn twice, unloaded my groceries, then guilt-walked 50 feet back to buy two bags. Didn’t ask for the price—spent $45 on flavors I don’t want, and I prefer classic butter popcorn anyway.

,tifu,"I was working at home very late and got hungry so I threw a frozen egg, sausage, and cheese biscuit in the microwave. I cook most stuff in the microwave on a low setting. My oven has inverter technology so it's particularly good at cooking slowly. Low-power cooking with an inverter allows the food to heat more evenly, and cooks certain things better - like without changing texture. These biscuits come out heated perfectly through every time. It's truly amazing.

So I put it in for 6 minutes at 20% power. When it was done I flipped the sandwich over and set it for another 12 minutes. I returned to my desk and worked. My mind was deeply in my work. 

I'm always smelling food being cooked by neighbors and sometimes they make really good smelling stuff. After a couple minutes sitting my there I noticed the smell of something delicious - but only in the background. I didn't think about it - it registered way in the back of my mind somewhere.

After another couple minutes, I smelled someone baking a cake or something. It was a unique sweet aroma, and again it smelled delicious. For this, my conscious mind picked up on it just enough to sort of think ""Wow, that smells amazing, but why are my neighbors baking at 2:00 am?""

Another minute, again deeply focused, I started to detect something uncomfortable happening, but I couldn't pull my mind away from my work (ADHD hyperfocus is a bitch). Another minutes after that I became aware of what the discomfort was - I was something burning. My neighbors totally screwed up. Oh well. Again, I was deeply focused.

Another minute and the smell pulled me out of my work-focus and I thought ""They really burnt the shit out of their food.""

FINALLY, my brain was able to get a message to me - ""DUDE! YOU'VE GOT FOOD IN THE MICROWAVE! IS THAT WHAT'S BURNING!?""

I jumped up and ran to the kitchen and the smell got really strong, and then I saw the microwave. Thick, dense, brown-gray smoke was pouring out the top like some kind of industrial waste-burning chimney. The room was filling with the acrid smoke quickly. It was very uncomfortable to breathe. I opened the microwave and once the rest of the smoke cleared I saw my biscuit. A charred lump of black ex-food, smoldering, still emitting whisps of smoke.

It turned out that I set the oven time for 10 minutes but I was so focused on my work that I forgot to set the power to 20%, so the thawed biscuit continued to cook at 1100 watts for 8 minutes. My kitchen exhaust fan was on, so the aromas and smoke were mostly pulled out the window so it took a long time for it to reach me.

Since I didn't smell it quickly, the oven had the opportunity to cook the living crap out of the sandwich. It had probably been smoking for a couple minutes and I didn't didn't smell it. I opened windows and let the exhaust fan clear all the smoke. For the next week, everything in my kitchen continued to smell like that awful smoke. It's now two weeks after that happened, and the kitchen is okay except for my expensive inverter technology microwave which still smells as if there's currently burning waste inside.

The smoke was so dense it had to have coated all the electronics inside with thick soot. I'm sure the smell will go away, but at this point I'm thinking 4 months, and I imagine the soot will shorten it's life. Bummer, man.

,tifu,"The title might worry you, so I’m going to preface this by saying no, the dog did not get hurt in any way.



At the church I used to go to, one of the pastors hosted a Christmas party in his house. I noticed the family’s dog had a stuffed toy that she was repeatedly picking up and tossing around. It looked like she wanted someone to play with her. So, during a time I had “broken off” from the crowd, I picked the toy up and waved it around by it’s arm until the dog grabbed it. The arm ended up tearing off very easily, to the point where I was thinking “Man, what kind of dog toy breaks that easily?”



Later on, the pastor sees me waving the toy around at the dog, and asked me where I found it. I told him “The dog just had it, right over there (points)” “That was supposed to hang on the door, it wasn’t really a dog toy” “I’m sorry, the dog had it and I assumed it was hers.”



Thankfully he didn’t really show much annoyance/anger at me, but I was still a bit embarrassed.

  
P.S.: When the toy/decoration separated in my hands too easily, the thought did cross my mind that it wasn't a dog toy after all, but of course it was too late by then.

,tifu,"Sound pretty tame, I know, but trust me it’s a bit worse than that. This happened last year. I was flying long distance from the US to Sweden for a holiday. I’ve had plenty of flying experience but I’ve always hated flights as I get sick extremely easily and also tend to get anxious on the plane. My boyfriend sat behind me because we couldn’t get seats together, so I was stuck in the middle seat between a woman and another guy. An hour and a half before landing, I decided to order an instant soup cup because I wasn’t feeling good and pretty hungry. I downed it and half an hour later, the plane began to descend. I was already feeling the anxiety that had lingered for the entire flight. It was extremely bumpy and the turbulence was getting really bad. My stomach was churning and I prayed for the best, but unfortunately, I felt everything in my stomach rising up my throat. I immediately grabbed the vomit bag that was in front of me and within 10 seconds all of the soup that I ingested was out. I couldn’t really see what the reactions around me were, but I think they were pretty shocked. I kept going for another 20 seconds until I was done. I was shaking at this point, hands trembling while I hold onto the bag of bile. I stared into nothing, horrified, I have never done this before in my 10+ years of flying. But it’s okay, it’s in the bag, and I’m fine, right? And then, the worst thing that could possibly happen at that moment happened, the plane shook violently and I lost grip of the bag. Oh fuck. The bag dropped and spilt all over the floor infront of me, landing on my shoes, the woman beside me’s legs and her shoes. I could’ve died there and then. We were both lost for words but I tried to apologise as best as I can while she gave me some wet wipes to clean up and she took off her shoes to clean it. The guy beside me attempted to move away from me as best as he could, he was lucky to have escape unscathed. It took the entirety of the landing duration to clean up as best as we could. I apologised to her again after the flight landed and she said “It’s okay I work at an ER, I’ve seen a lot worse.” Props to her for handling it so well and not going insane at me, ER workers are built different.

It was my choice since a few months before breaking up I started feeling like the relationship was more of a chore, rather than a commitment. I decided to break up with my ex since I thought she didn't deserve that. She understood, and we ended the relationship in good terms.

My ex doesn't matter here, it's what happened after her. Literally a month after I broke up with my ex, I met this one girl through one of my closest female friends and she was great. She showed great interest in me, initiating conversation with me on the daily and was always very sweet to me. I liked her too, but then I thought of why I was single in the first place. I decided to not lead her on, and started making it clear I only wanted her as a friend, because I genuinely found her to be a great person to keep around, but I didn't want to risk it by dating her and it not working out because I wasn't in the right place to do it. I just thought it would've been selfish.

To this day she is a great friend to me and has become one of my closest ones through time. However, things have changed, she is now in a relationship and honestly it never bothered me.

I gave her advice, she said thanks, then next moment we started talking about my stance on relationships (I have told her that I've been avoiding them for a while) , then she started telling me about how she used to have a crush on me when we first met.

,tifu,"This happened about an hour ago, so I'm still awaiting the consequences.

My wife got up very early this morning to make cinnamon rolls for a friend who was visiting us and left this morning.  There were leftovers, and she told me that they were in the kitchen if I wanted some when I got up.  After waking, I went to the kitchen and grabbed a roll and tossed it in the toaster oven to rewarm it.  Then I opened the fridge to grab the cream cheese icing she made.  The last time she did, I had mentioned the recipe was a little *too* cream-cheesy, so she tried a different recipe this time.  There it was, in a glass measuring cup on the top shelf.  At this point it was cold and hard to spread, so I popped out a few tablespoons and put it on my now hot roll and let it soften and then spread it around.

I sat down at my work computer and at my roll while checking emails and messages.  As I ate, I noticed the icing wasn't particularly sweet, but also didn't taste like cheese at all.  But it was also a bit smoky?  Or maybe that was the cinnamon roll?  Either way, I was hungry and I finished my roll and my first morning meeting.  Curious about the icing, I asked my wife if she used the recipe my sister had sent us yesterday, and she said she had.  I noted it was a bit smoky and not very sweet and she was confused.  I mentioned where I had pulled the frosting from, and she cackled, ""THAT'S NOT ICING, THAT'S BACON GREASE!"".  So I responded in kind, ""WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE ICING?  AND WHERE IS THE ICING??""  Apparently, the icing was on the counter, still in the mixing bowl.

As I write this, my stomach is occasionally gurgling, like a thunderstorm on the horizon, and my wife is shaming me to her sisters and mine, and anyone else she can get ahold of.  I expect in a few hours greased lightning will be shooting from my anus and my wife will be laughing outside the door.

Keep in mind that there's no alcohol involved to make this kind of decision, but oh boy...curse my hubris.

,tifu,"Throwaway account for anonymity of everyone involved. Let me start by explaining that before our wedding, my fiance (34m)  and I (28f) were going to premarital counseling with the pastor who would be our officiant. This was more a formality than anything else, as my partner and I aren't especially religious. But having a Christian ceremony would make our large families happy, and this was a pastor I've known well since I was a small child. So we met up with him several times before the wedding to get mentally and spiritually prepared for the commitment.

As we are wrapping up one of these meetings, the conversation casually turns to the enormous saltwater fishtank in his office. My partner and I are also aquarium people, and I was excited to show the pastor a new fish we had just added to our home tank. As he's standing over my shoulder in anticipation of fish pics, I realize there are other photos in my phone from some kinky fun times my partner and I were having the night before. I attempt to quickly scroll past those photos, but accidently open one instead. 

There, on the screen, burning into our pastor's eyeballs, is a very explicit photo of my partner bent over, bits danglin' and bussy POPPIN'. 

I will emphasize, this is NOT a picture of a fish.

He made a frightened ""oop"" and literally dashed to the other side of the room behind his desk. I was mortified but he said nothing, just kept talking about fish, and acted like nothing happened.

But I know. My partner knows. The man who is going to stand at the altar and marry us has seen into the depths of our souls. Or at least, the depths of my partner's butthole 🙃. This is a man who also knows my father VERY well, a man that would never understand the kinds of things we do in the bedroom to satisfy queer fantasies (because being queer will send you to hell, supposedly). 

The wedding is soon. I really hope he still agrees to officiate and we didn't scare him off. I'm going to be standing at the altar thinking about my new husband, and the pastor certainly might be too!!!

So we met up with him several times before the wedding to get mentally and spiritually prepared for the commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we are wrapping up one of these meetings, the conversation casually turns to the enormous saltwater fishtank in his office. My partner and I are also aquarium people, and I was excited to show the pastor a new fish we had just added to our home tank. As he&amp;#39;s standing over my shoulder in anticipation of fish pics, I realize there are other photos in my phone from some kinky fun times my partner and I were having the night before. I attempt to quickly scroll past those photos, but accidently open one instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, on the screen, burning into our pastor&amp;#39;s eyeballs, is a very explicit photo of my partner bent over, bits danglin&amp;#39; and bussy POPPIN&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will emphasize, this is NOT a picture of a fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He made a frightened &amp;quot;oop&amp;quot; and literally dashed to the other side of the room behind his desk. I was mortified but he said nothing, just kept talking about fish, and acted like nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I know. My partner knows. The man who is going to stand at the altar and marry us has seen into the depths of our souls. Or at least, the depths of my partner&amp;#39;s butthole 🙃. This is a man who also knows my father VERY well, a man that would never understand the kinds of things we do in the bedroom to satisfy queer fantasies (because being queer will send you to hell, supposedly). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wedding is soon. I really hope he still agrees to officiate and we didn&amp;#39;t scare him off. I&amp;#39;m going to be standing at the altar thinking about my new husband, and the pastor certainly might be too!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: As in the title, I accidentally showed a very intimate photo of my partner to the man that will officiate our wedding and I have no idea how to face him on the day of.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"My first post here - A Midnight Cooking Disaster

Last night was one for the books. After a really long, exhausting day, I found myself feeling hungry around midnight. I was tired but thought I could handle cooking up something simple—boiled eggs. Low efforts, right?

I set the egg to boil and unfortunately, crashed on my bed while waiting for them to be ready.

Fast forward four hours, I wake up to the smell of something burning and a light haze of smoke in my home. I bolted to the kitchen only to find my stainless steel pot still on the stove, the egg.....cooked is an understatement.

Luckily, nothing caught fire. I quickly turned off the gas and opened all the windows to air out the place. Took a breather outside, letting the house clear out.

Not gonna lie, the whole thing shook me up a bit. I can’t help but wonder what might have happened if I’d woken up any later.

,tifu,"As I (29F) do every weekend, I was watching Shayne Topp from iCarly read “yikes” reddit stories after having a lovely, calm, peaceful weekend. They read this story about a teacher whose student found out his dad may not be his dad, due to having a blood type that would not be possible based on his parents blood types.

A little background info: I will sum up my family relationship as a whole by saying it is straight up complicated and I have the therapy bills to prove it lol. My parents divorced a few years ago and my mom moved away. I have since started to heal and work on myself instead of laughing everything off and detaching.

Now, I have always had little suspicions about my dad being my bio dad. I can see where I look like my mom, but not my dad. The features I share with my sister, are my moms. I have a few that nooo one in my family has. My dad was not on my birth certificate, which was vaguely explained. But when looking for my birth cert years ago I found my mom’s divorce papers from AFTER I was born. My parents got married when I was 2 or 3 I think. But it’s never mattered deep down because my dad is my dad and that will continue to be the case. I have no interest in changing that regardless so besides a few jokes here and there I never looked into it.

That is, until I decided to watch that episode, and without thinking but just being excited about punnet squares, text my dad asking his blood type. Now my mom is type O, and I know this bc what kind of narcissist would she be without informing everyone that she is a universal donor. So when my dad said A+, I went “…..” and speedily opened up google and what do you know THEY CANT MAKE A B- BABY LIKE ME NOW CAN THEY

I verified with him my mom is O and then told him to call me. Then IMMEDIATELY REGRETTED IT and breathed a sigh of relief when he said he was golfing and would later. And then IMMEDIATELY called my grandma (she’s a real one, ultimate confidant) and asked if she knew any secrets and explained the situation (and how genetics works which was a journey and made me sound real smart, so at least there’s that) and she was not helpful but bless her for trying. 

Chatted with my dad on the phone, he was kinda like wtf and he looked for his blood donor card while we chatted about things. Books, tv, his girlfriends kids starting school. We were both pretty chill about it. He couldn’t find it but did tell me that my mom was actually still very married to this man, but he said they had a horrible relationship, and it seems like they may as well have been estranged/separated/whatever like I was told. But they lived together…..neither of us seemed surprised, and later over text he said he was always curious but it wouldn’t change anything. 

So, we may take a Walgreens paternity test this week when we have our planned dinner. I feel incredibly guilty for making this a thing when I’m either completely desensitized to the point I don’t care, or I really don’t care. Either way, it does not change anything for me. He will remain my dad that I love and look up to, and I will not be going on some “who is my real dad” kind of journey. That’s not my thing. However I may have just inadvertently hurt my dad, causing or reopening a wound that I feel so guilty for. I wish I had not been curious, I pray that he really is all “wow color me surprised…not” about it like he seemed. I always joke that the one thing I got from my dad was his sense of humor and skill at COD. Praying to the universe I did get his sense of humor and it matches in this scenario (blood or not blood). I will be so mad at myself if I am hurting him.


I fun fact-ed myself too close to the sun, I fear.

TLDR; Shayne Topp from iCarly read a story about blood types spotlighting paternity inconsistencies. Realized my blood type spotlighted paternity inconsistencies.

,tifu,"When my wife and I met, she was about 135lb and I was 200lb. She’s 5’8” and I’m 6’. I was very active and went to the gym 5x a week back then so I could pick her up and toss her around easily. That was 10+ years ago. Since then, I had a health issue that made me lose 25lb. I’m better now but I obviously also lost a lot of strength from that. We’ve also had two kids so obviously my wife put on some weight from that and wasn’t able to lose it all after like she wanted to.

My wife now weighs 160lb and I want to make it very clear that I absolutely love it. That extra 25lb went to all the right places, if you know what I mean. I do not think she’s fat or overweight, I have never said that, or even joked about it. I think she’s the sexiest woman alive.

So earlier this year, our youngest started school so we finally had 100% alone time at home for the first time in years (neither of us have family nearby). So we started messing around throughout the house, just like we did before kids. But I noticed I couldn’t lift, carry, or toss her the same way I did when we met. So I decided it’s time to hit the gym again since it’s been years and I only weighed 175. I’ve been working out for 6 months, gained about 10lb already, and got a lot stronger. My wife noticed the muscle gain and we started talking about working out and she asked why I decided to start again out of nowhere. So without thinking about how it sounds, I told her exactly why 🤦‍♂️. 

In my head, she’s perfect, and me struggling to lift her is my problem, not hers. But obviously she sees it differently. She’s not super pissed or anything, but I can tell she’s a bit bummed about it. She’s a confident woman and she’ll be just fine in a day or two but I should’ve worded it differently or just made up a different reason when she asked lol.

May 2023, I realised I developed some feelings for R, and requested for some space in our friendship, so that I can sort out the feelings. I went to therapy, worked on myself and was able to move past the feelings and got in contact with R again and we slowly began to become friends again. Few months ago, we had an honest conversation about although she has moved past the incident, she sometimes gets uncomfortable and overthink if she is giving me some signals. The main reason for this is that unfortunately I am an overwhelmingly clingy person and can often give a lot in friendships and sometimes that can be a lot for her and can make her uncomfortable. She also confesses that she hasn't had any close guy friends, because most of them would develop feelings for her and then cut off contact with her and I am the only friend who started talking to her again. We had a discussion and decided that I will try to respect her boundaries more and she will try not to overthink too much whenever we are just being friends. 

Now, let's come to what happened last weekend. I went on a trip with some of my friends (but not R) and I found a really cool hat which was perfectly R's style and 100% would have suited her. I did not think about it properly and impulsively bought it for her. It costed me 15 Dollars, which is not too bad for me. When I gave her the hat, I realised she actually got a bit uncomfortable.

It immediately hit me then that I came on too strong, and seemed like a creep because I bought something specifically for her. She did say that she knows that I didn't have bad intentions and was just trying to be a friend, and she doesn't like saying this either, but this is something that did make her uncomfortable. We did decide that I will take the hat back, but I feel like a shitty person at the moment. I definitely messed up really bad and in hindsight it all was kind of creepy.

,tifu,"I live I a conservative red state. I had to attend a funeral in another state last week. To do this I had to leave my 14 year old son alone overnight. He's a pretty good kid and I didn't even think twice about it. All he had to do was get up and go to school and I'd be home after school that night. 

Well on my way out the door I jokingly said ""no parties"" thinking nothing of it. 
I attend the funeral. Make my way home. Everything is good. 

Saturday comes around, I wake up, step outside to smoke. And there's a note on my door.. it says,"" I have pictures of your son sucking a big pick veiny dildo. I'm almost as big. Want to let let me smash""

Le sigh.. it's 7 am on a Saturday. I'm too old for this shit.  So I immediately check my box of adult toys that I keep under my bed. And be damned if I'm not missing a big pink veiny dildo. I woke my son up, shoved the note in his face and I'm like "" what is this"".

Being a typical teenager he's like "" I don't know"" 
Then I'm like ""where is it""
Again "" I don't know"" 

It's now 715 in the morning on a Saturday and I'm on my way to his friends house. Madder than hell. I knock on the door. Mom answers the door with the cutest little baby money on her shoulder. I ask for her son. She brings me two sleepy teenage boys. 

First thing I do is show her the note. Her son tries to blame his friend.. but Mom is not having it and says bull shit that's your handwriting. So now I know who wrote the note. Some kid I never even met.

Ladies and gentlemen do you know how hard it is to yell at 2 sleepy teenage boys at 7 30 am on a Saturday.. When all you want to do is pet the little baby monkey. But you can't cause you've been yelling for the last 10 minutes and have scared it.

I had to attend a funeral in another state last week. To do this I had to leave my 14 year old son alone overnight. He&amp;#39;s a pretty good kid and I didn&amp;#39;t even think twice about it. All he had to do was get up and go to school and I&amp;#39;d be home after school that night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well on my way out the door I jokingly said &amp;quot;no parties&amp;quot; thinking nothing of it. 
I attend the funeral. Make my way home. Everything is good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday comes around, I wake up, step outside to smoke. And there&amp;#39;s a note on my door.. it says,&amp;quot; I have pictures of your son sucking a big pick veiny dildo. I&amp;#39;m almost as big. Want to let let me smash&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Le sigh.. it&amp;#39;s 7 am on a Saturday. I&amp;#39;m too old for this shit.  So I immediately check my box of adult toys that I keep under my bed. And be damned if I&amp;#39;m not missing a big pink veiny dildo. I woke my son up, shoved the note in his face and I&amp;#39;m like &amp;quot; what is this&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a typical teenager he&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t know&amp;quot; 
Then I&amp;#39;m like &amp;quot;where is it&amp;quot;
Again &amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t know&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s now 715 in the morning on a Saturday and I&amp;#39;m on my way to his friends house. Madder than hell. I knock on the door. Mom answers the door with the cutest little baby money on her shoulder. I ask for her son. She brings me two sleepy teenage boys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing I do is show her the note. Her son tries to blame his friend.. but Mom is not having it and says bull shit that&amp;#39;s your handwriting. So now I know who wrote the note. Some kid I never even met. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I have to proceed to yell at these 2 sleepy teenage boys about privacy. And how violated I feel. This went on for a good 10 minutes. Cause I was mad and felt violated.

,tifu,"This did not happen today, but just about a year ago. At the time, my wife and I were married for about a year.  My wife and I have very opposite interests, but we both support each other in the things that the other loves.  

For example, I love going to different conventions, dressing up in costume, meeting celebrities, and checking out the unique merchandise that is sold. My wife is a big football fan, and will never miss a game if she can help it. My wife will come to conventions with me and I'll watch the games with her and occasionally we make it to one in person.  

A lot of people have questioned our dynamic because of our interests. To distill it down simply, I was a theater kid who wrote for the school newspaper and she played softball and loves football. People asked how on earth we fit together, even my mother, but we balance each other very well and I can't see myself with anyone else.  

My wife pointed out to me at one point that even if my interests aren't her thing, she loves that when I do my favorite things, the fact that I want her to be a part of them speaks volumes about how I feel about her and I feel the same way.  

On to the fuck up. Last year we attended a game for her favorite NFL team. Her dad bought tickets for the entire family and invited us to get there early to tailgate in the parking lot.  

As we were getting ready, my wife stated that as we would be grilling in the parking lot and going through a crowded stadium, it might be prudent to leave our wedding rings at home. Earlier in the year, a stone fell out of mine when we were on vacation, and I searched for an hour before finding it. So I agreed with her.  

I jokingly asked her what we should say if anyone asks why we're not wearing our rings. My wife rolled her eyes and said nobody would notice that. I said that someone was bound to notice it and we need to come up with something funny to say. We decided that if anyone asked, we would whisper, ""Well, we're working on things..."" and just leave it at that.  

Well, we arrived, had a great time, and nobody said anything. We posted several group photos to Facebook and Instagram along with photos of us grilling in the parking lot. About ten minutes later, my mother texted me.  

""Why aren't you guys wearing your wedding rings in the photo you put up on Facebook?""  

I showed it to my wife, and we both cracked up laughing.  

So I sent the following back, ""Well, we're trying to work on things, but the tickets were already purchased, so...""  

We had a good laugh, forgot about it, headed inside, and had a great time.  

Cue the end of the game. We headed out to our car, waited in the queue to get out, and then began to drive home.  

About five minutes into the trip, notifications start going off on my phone. I hadn't realized that the stadium had terrible cell service, was essentially a dead zone, and didn't bother to connect to the stadium WiFi.  

""I know you're kidding, but please confirm that for me...""  

""It's really not funny to joke about. I'm very nervous about you guys...""  

""What does that mean you're working on things? Why aren't you wearing your rings?""

""Please pick up your phone.""  

""This is not to week to do this to me, I am freaking out right now!""  

""Why aren't you answering your phone?""  

By the time I called to assure her that I had simply been joking, she had already called multiple relatives freaking out that my wife and I were splitting up and I wasn't answering the phone. When they heard the details, everyone else thought it was pretty hilarious. My mother, however, did not, and is still angry that we pulled that on her.

,tifu,"So recently, I started going to the playground with my 2-year-old. He loves it – slides, swings, the whole deal. It's been great, especially since he gets tired out, making bedtime a breeze. But... I seriously messed up.

It's been getting colder, so he's been wearing longer pants – those soft polyester ones because they're warm. The playground has plastic slides and metal stairs, which means a lot of static electricity gets built up.

The first time it happened, he went down the slide, I grabbed his hand to help him off, and zap – static shock. He looked confused but shrugged it off. He goes down the slide again, and zap, it happens again when I grab his hand. Now he's visibly upset, not crying, but giving me that ""what the hell, Dad?"" look.

This has been happening for the past 3-4 playground trips, and now he outright refuses to hold my hand. Every time I reach for him, he says, ""Dada, no poke."" He still wants to go outside but won't touch any of the playground equipment except the swings.

The worst part? He somehow managed to shock himself on the metal stairs, and now he won't hold the railing either, which is definitely not safe for a toddler.

So yeah, no more playground for us for a while. I’ll just have to deal with longer nap times until he forgets about the ""pokes.""

,tifu,"So this happened in the last 24 hours. My wife wife and I are poly. She's bi so we both get to date women. There is a girl at my work who is recently divorced who I've been friends with for past 6 months. No feelings by either party. Well I told her about being poly and we had became pretty close. Well I'm dumb cause this is where I fucked up. I'm on the spectrum and have a hard time with girls hitting on me. I can never get it right. Anyways I thought I was crazy cause over text we were friends but in real life she seemed like a different  person. I thought I was looking into it too much maybe she's being nice and that's all. Well she came into work after her shift alittle drunk cause she was going to drink with the other servers at my work. I made her some food and then she got really close to me kept touching me. She even said I looked really nice and that she liked my eyes. We talked about some other stuff. She asked if I wanted to come with to the bar. I declined cause I was tired and live far away. She asked for a hug I gave it to her and they left. I thought at this point she liked me, but I didn't know if it was the drinking or if she actually did. We texted that night she apologized for the hug I told her it was OK so now I'm confused. Finally, last night we were texting all day. I was still really confused cause she's way out of my league but I didn't know how to feel. I wanted to clear the air. I asked her if we could talk about that night cause I was confused. I said that were the vibes I was picking up real because I feel crazy. I also said that I didn't want to lose our friendship over something that isn't there.

My wife wife and I are poly. She&amp;#39;s bi so we both get to date women. There is a girl at my work who is recently divorced who I&amp;#39;ve been friends with for past 6 months. No feelings by either party. Well I told her about being poly and we had became pretty close. Well I&amp;#39;m dumb cause this is where I fucked up. I&amp;#39;m on the spectrum and have a hard time with girls hitting on me. I can never get it right. Anyways I thought I was crazy cause over text we were friends but in real life she seemed like a different  person. I thought I was looking into it too much maybe she&amp;#39;s being nice and that&amp;#39;s all. Well she came into work after her shift alittle drunk cause she was going to drink with the other servers at my work. I made her some food and then she got really close to me kept touching me. She even said I looked really nice and that she liked my eyes. We talked about some other stuff. She asked if I wanted to come with to the bar. I declined cause I was tired and live far away. She asked for a hug I gave it to her and they left. I thought at this point she liked me, but I didn&amp;#39;t know if it was the drinking or if she actually did. We texted that night she apologized for the hug I told her it was OK so now I&amp;#39;m confused. Finally, last night we were texting all day. I was still really confused cause she&amp;#39;s way out of my league but I didn&amp;#39;t know how to feel. I wanted to clear the air. I asked her if we could talk about that night cause I was confused. I said that were the vibes I was picking up real because I feel crazy. I also said that I didn&amp;#39;t want to lose our friendship over something that isn&amp;#39;t there. She said that she was just tipsy and that she only saw me as her friend.

,tifu,"I'm laughing so hard about this that I've had tears. Sorry about formatting, I'm on mobile

Sunday I try to tidy my house, visit family and get ready for the work week ahead.
Im a single woman, recently bought my own place and live alone. 

This morning, after waking up, I was a little bored and horny so I took one of my toys to have some fun.
It's purple, vibrates and is double appendaged (sorry about details but they're important lol).

After I finished having my fun I went to the bathroom, washed my friend but instead of drying it I left it hanging on the towel rack using the appendages to hook it onto the rack.
I had to go out to the shops and then went to see family.

Ended up going to lunch with my sister  and niblings and invited them to spend time at my place...completely forgetting about my little friend in the bathroom...

Thank God we stayed in the backyard, the kids were distracted helping me build a few chairs and playing with a kid friendly axe game I recently bought.

My sister went inside to use the toilet where she had a ""dizzy spell"" after washing her hands in the ""kitchen"".

About 15mins later she and the kids left and I walked into the bathroom, saw my purple friend was still hanging there and freaked out. 
I rang my sister straight away and asked ""You said you used the kitchen sink to wash your hands yeah?""
She said ""Um yeah, whys that?""
I was relieved and just said ""No reason. Just asking.""

Hours passed, I fired up my new BBQ and was cooking some sausages when I got a text from my sister. 
Here's the text exchange word for word:

Sis: ""Urgh... I'm so sick of buzz kills""

Me: ""Huh who's killing your buzz?""

Sis: ""You did, that's why I left...""

Me: ""Mkay...and how did I do that exactly?...""

Sis: ""Don't worry about it. I'm sick of talking until I'm purple.""

Me: ""Ok...Still don't know what you're on about though""

My sister then sent 6 gifs all relating to ""good vibes""

This is when I clicked and not only was absolutely horrified but I couldn't stop laughing.

Me: "" You went into the bathroom...🤣""

Sis: "" No idea what you're on about""

Me: ""Freaking knew you did 🤣""

Sis: ""Loser""

I apologised for forgetting about it and let her know I'll be more careful next time. She said I'm fucked but I know she must be laughing about it as well. 

I'm laughing so hard and I just know my sister is going to tell our cousins. They're going to be coming atound next week for my house-warming. I'm freaking dying lol 😆

,tifu,"I finally decided it was time to clean my room and free up some space. I eventually made my way to the nightstand by my bed. I started with the bottom drawer and worked my way up to the top, where instead of a drawer, there’s just an open shelf. After sorting through that space, I noticed a clear bottle lying on its side in the far left corner.

At first, I was confused, just staring at it trying to remember what it was. I had brought in some paint thinner called gamsol and left it in the nightstand during my move in a year ago. Strangely the bottle looked empty, and I couldn't spot the air bubble. I was slightly confused so I reached in and grabbed it. Upon closer inspection, I realized about 1/6 of the paint thinner was left, but the cap was slightly loose. Mind you, this bottle is the size of a regular Costco water bottle, and last time I saw it, it was practically full.

Apparently this stuff had been slowly evaporating into my room, and I’ve been unknowingly breathing it in every day for hours.

Now I’m a little worried. I’ve had some breathing issues recently, and for the past four months I’ve been dealing with gut problems. Are these connected? Who knows. But at least I found the bottle now.

,tifu,"Trigger warning: child abuse, domestic violence

I recently started seeing a man who I've known on a surface level for five years. We decided to do a few question and answer activities to get to know each other more intimately and landed on one asking what we would change about our childhoods. 

He said something innocuous about not moving so often and I just nonchalantly answered ""Probably the child abuse."" He was visibly uncomfortable but didn't ask questions about it and we moved on.

A few questions later we were instructed to tell our life story in an abbreviated version. His was ""First we moved to A location then B location then C, etc."" And mine started nice enough with being born and having a few siblings and then moved into the violence we faced at the hands of my dad, going into some details about the situations that have stuck with me.

In the moment, it was just me describing shocking things that happened to me but his reaction had me rethinking sharing these things and wondering if I'm actually still traumatized and not the well adjusted adult I believe myself to be.

I talked with him about it a few days later and apologized for being so blasé about my upbringing and the abuses we faced and for sharing too many details. He said it's ok because it's my experiences but that it just made him sad for me. 

I discussed the situation with my therapist sister and was reassured I'm likely not traumatized by it based on how I'm able to discuss the events nonchalantly.

,tifu,"Just started a new serving job at a small restaurant downtown in my city. I have worked three shifts before this, and the atmosphere there is super cute and intimate and everyone is lovely, and it is CRAZY busy around dinner time. 

I hopped in the shower a couple hours before my shift and started having intense cramps and nausea. I’d had been (tmi) painfully stuck on the toilet before that. I ended up taking a few tylenol about 1.5 hrs before my shift, but they didn’t help my stomach and I was honestly feeling pretty weak. I was getting nervous about what the reason for the pain was, as I have recently been going through a slight health scare with random patches of Petechiae on my body, along with feeling weak and exhausted as well. I asked my bf what he thought I should do, and he suggested that I get ready and continue to monitor how I feel; it wasn’t until 30 minutes out that I texted my manager that I wouldn’t be making it in. I ended up labelling the pain as due to my period as well.

I’m realizing now that I fucked up ROYALLY. I don’t know what happened, but I swear that while she was first showing me around the restaurant on my first day she had told me that if I ever need to call out, that I could just text her and let her know… I thought she had spoke about some other people doing that and it being fine? But honestly, I probably misunderstood what she said, as it was very loud in there. I don’t know why I assumed that calling out would be okay. It wouldn’t make any sense for her to say that she was okay with her staff doing that. 

After grabbing some painkillers from the store with my boyfriend, the pain noticeably decreased. I wound up going to bed early anyway because I was bone tired. 

I’ve just woken up to a text from my manager at from a couple hours ago and she is understandably extremely upset. She told me that I should not come in for anymore shifts; I got fired. I don’t know what to do. I quit my other job to take this one, and am putting myself through school and have bills I’m responsible for.

,tifu,"This happened less than 24 hours ago.

So my girlfriend (25F) is pregnant with our first child so she spends a lot of time at my (24M) house. She's from out of town (30ish minutes away by car), so she's at my place on and off.

Yesterday I had a relative's birthday at a bar ( private event ) so I decided to invite her since she doesn't really go out anymore. I worked in the morning and had the chance to have a Tequilla tasting with a guy who drinks Tequilla for a living, which was amazing since I could get tipsy for my shitty shift. Then, I worked my regular 12 - 10 pm shift, got back home at 11, showered, and went straight to the party with my SO and family.

We all had a great time she sipped on her virgin cocktails while I destroyed my wallet and got shit faced. Everything was going perfect we danced, socialized, saw some people that I hadn't seen in years and the bonus was that I was drunk but nowhere near my limit ( blacking out, fumbling or puking ).

We stayed till around 3 am. before we finally decided it was time for us to go. We get home, change into our pyjamas, and hit the sack.

Now, this is when the FU happens. See, I have a history of sleepwalking ( alcohol makes it more likely to happen ), and it turns out I was gonna relive what usually ends up being a funny story.

So those who are familiar with somnambulism will know that you'll generally have little or no memory of these incidents, so all I have is my SO's testimony and the evidence  i had the next morning ( unusable work attire ).

Essentially I woke up in the middle of the night/morning got up and went to the corner of the room where she had her purse, she found it a bit weird since I was just kinda staring at the wall. Until she heard a noise that sounded like a stream, confused as she was, she started to put two and two together and started yelling and berating me. I stopped turned around and stared at her for a few seconds and then went to finish what I started in the right place. After a minute or two, I came back to our room, ignored her cleaning my mess, and went back to bed.

Safe to say, I got the cold shoulder in the morning until we finally talked and laughed about it. I had already told her I was a sleepwalker and a few funny stories that happened in the past. Now, she one upped me in embarrassing stories to tell our future child.

TL;DR: Sleepwalked and pissed in my girlfriend's purse.

She shoplifted like a 5$ keychain, when she had so much money in her purse. I didn't find out about this until later that day when we hopped on a facetime call and she showed the keychain to me. And I was like ""Oh that's cute, where did you get it?"", and she got all weird. She told me that she stole it and how much it was. And initially I didn't say anything about it, but I was honestly irked. The next day (The day before my birthday),  I confronted her shoplifting the dumb keychain. And she said ""Its not my fault, its just how I was raised"", and I got pissed off and told her to take accountability for her actions instead of blaming other people for her mistakes, then she ""took accountability"" by blaming it on her mental illnesses, which IMO shouldn't be ones scapegoat, and that's not taking REAL accountability for your actions. Which I told her. And we got into the worst fight in my life, and even though it was just words...It felt like I was hit by a train. At the end of the fight, she told me that she wanted to break up and blocked me. Which hurt even more.

,tifu,"This was not today, sorry. It was a few weeks ago. 

I had an outdoor electrical plug that had been on the fritz for a long time. If I had to guess, I'd say I neglected getting it fixed for a couple years if not more. Then I decided that I wanted to fix it. So I hired an electrician to come to my house and replace the outlet. He showed up the next day, was very nice and understanding.

Generally it wouldn't have required him to come into my home, but unfortunately I don't have the fuse box labeled so I couldn't just go hit the switch. I have 3 cats however, and they like to hang out in my bedroom. I don't want to close the door to my bedroom because their food, water and litter boxes are in the living room. 

The man went into the basement to get to the fuse box, and the doorway to my bedroom with the door wiiiiiiide open is right by the door to the basement. He had to try a few switches before getting the right one, and in retrospect I wish I asked him to help me get my fuse box labeled. That aside, he turned off the power in my bedroom at some point. But that wouldn't really do anything right? 

Well, I found out that, no, that *would* actually do something. The guy finished up what he was doing outside, then went back downstairs to turn the power back on. When he came back into the living room, where I was, he had a grin on his face. I didn't think much of it. I paid for his service and he left.

After that, I went into the basement to check that none of my cats went down there. As I passed my bedroom, I noticed my image LED light had turned on when the power got restarted. I thought it was neat. I checked the basement, then came back upstairs. This time I *really* looked into my room at the light. 

I was watching it change colors when I realized something. I was so used to it that I hadn't thought twice about where the light was placed. It was in a very dark room on top of a display case full of adult toys. I keep my room dark so it was hard to see much, but it was obvious what was in the case even in the dim light. That would have been bad enough, unfortunately that was not all. I air dry my toys after cleaning them by putting them *on top* of the case. In front of the light was a large dragon dildo. And in front of that was a second *larger* dragon dildo. 

I understood why the electrician smiled at me the way he did. He *saw*. 

I gave him 5 stars online with zero comment. 

TL,DR: I hired an electrician to fix an outlet, and accidentally exposed him to my silicone sculpture collection.

I (f31) and my little sister (f27) work at the same store. I was at a different location but this year I transferred to the store she works at as a manager 3 levels higher than her.

At my old store I always made special treats for holidays or whenever I got stressed out. And my coworkers at my old store all loved my baked goods to the point that ot looked like the wildebeast scene from the lion king. My sister also did the same at her store

My sister expressed to coworkers when I moved stores that she was worried the people at her store would love my baked goods more than hers. Because of this, I just avoided bringing sweets all together and just kept them to neighbors or something of I was stressed.

It came to a head this month because for work we started our month long charity fundraiser. We were finally given permission to do a bake sale to raise money so I jumped in because I am used to mass production. So I made quite literally 200 dozen cookies (if not more), about 40 loaves of banana bread, peanut brottle, snack mixes of all kinds, and easily 45 dozen muffins over the course of a month. And whenever I brought product in, our coworkers would scavenge the boxes before even getting to the sell table and more times than none sold out of product within 12-18 hours. Meanwhile, my sister made cinnamon rolls and brownies and sold almost none in 2 days. She then went off in a huff, made a small scene about throwing everything in the garbage, and never brought product in again. 

Now, the fundraiser is over so obviously the bake sale is done. But now she hears from all of our customers and coworkers about how amazing the food was and of ill ever make more. Several regulars came in asking for the recipes. My sister made a whole show and said ""the stuff isn't even from scratch"". Which is a lie and she knows it. The only thing that wasn't 100% scratch was the muffins and it was still a dry mix. But one customer told her ""I don't care of it's not from scratch, they taste delicious!"". And since then, she has not brought anything to work, doesn't want to bake, and stopped talking to me about opening up her own bakery. I feel like an asshole but I also feel like she needed a reality check a bit.

Which by the way, I raised almost $6000 by myself with the food. And I spent some 200 hours of my own personal time for the month to make this stuff on top of my 50 hr a week job and 2 smalls kids. I am exhausted haha

,tifu,"Apologies in advance for typos. For reasons that will become apparent I'm typing this with my non-dominant hand.

A couple months ago my dad brought down a couple trees by his home. My parents live in an old farmhouse so he needs the wood for heating during the winter. Usually I help split it by hand but his year he decided to be sensible and rented a gas powered log splitter.

It was fantastic. 22 tons of hydraulic pressure tore even the largest and most knotted logs apart in seconds. What would normally be four weekends of work went by in six hours. 

We were careful the entire time. One person grabs logs, the other loads it, and hands stay off the lever until everyone knows a clear. 

Until the end. When we had five logs left we came across a log where half of it has grown perpendicular to the rest. There was no nice fork to aim the splitter at and the wood brought the blade to a dead stop every time we tried to split it. There were clear weak points I could see, but the log was large enough that it would overhang the edge and fall off the splitter if I tried to align those spots with the blade. But if I put a hand on the side of the log I could hold it steady while keeping it lined up. 

So I did something dumb. Five logs before I could go eat and this was the only one that looked difficult. It'll be fine, right? Just hold it steady for a couple seconds, split the log, then go inside. Easy.

Not easy. The log twisted the second the blade touched it, trapping my finger between the log and the steel strike plate at the back. Remember those 22 tons of pressure? Turns out that's a tiny bit more than a finger can take before crushing. I pulled the lever back immediately, but it was too late.

TL;DR - tried to hold a log steady while splitting it and crushed my finger when it shifted",t2_igmgf,False,,0,False,TIFU by being complacent while using a log splitter,[],r/tifu,False,7,M,0,,False,t3_1frpjbi,False,light,0.88,,public,80,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},M,False,80,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,2024-09-28 22:12:30,text,7,,,text,self.tifu,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies in advance for typos. For reasons that will become apparent I&amp;#39;m typing this with my non-dominant hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago my dad brought down a couple trees by his home. My parents live in an old farmhouse so he needs the wood for heating during the winter. Usually I help split it by hand but his year he decided to be sensible and rented a gas powered log splitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fantastic. 22 tons of hydraulic pressure tore even the largest and most knotted logs apart in seconds. What would normally be four weekends of work went by in six hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were careful the entire time. One person grabs logs, the other loads it, and hands stay off the lever until everyone knows a clear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the end. When we had five logs left we came across a log where half of it has grown perpendicular to the rest. There was no nice fork to aim the splitter at and the wood brought the blade to a dead stop every time we tried to split it. There were clear weak points I could see, but the log was large enough that it would overhang the edge and fall off the splitter if I tried to align those spots with the blade. But if I put a hand on the side of the log I could hold it steady while keeping it lined up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did something dumb. Five logs before I could go eat and this was the only one that looked difficult. It&amp;#39;ll be fine, right? Just hold it steady for a couple seconds, split the log, then go inside. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not easy. The log twisted the second the blade touched it, trapping my finger between the log and the steel strike plate at the back. Remember those 22 tons of pressure? Turns out that&amp;#39;s a tiny bit more than a finger can take before crushing. I pulled the lever back immediately, but it was too late. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately only some of my finger got pulped completely. I&amp;#39;m at the hospital right now to see how much can be salvaged. Any related puns or nicknames you have for me while I wait (90 minutes and not triaged yet...) would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"TIFU by thinking I’m more of a handyman than I really am.

 

I’ve been seeing this woman for a few months now. At our age, middle years, it’s more about learning about each other, understanding each other’s past and predilections, rather than the bounce and tickle.

 

It’s been a learning process for both of us, because we both own our own homes. My kids are all gone and her eldest moved out a few weeks ago. She has a daughter at home who needs special care. We've both enjoyed the journey so far.

 

To help out, I do handyman chores that she can’t do. She’s a wisp of a woman, barely 90 pounds soaking wet, but she has a big home with a lot of little chores that keep me busy on Saturday morning and early afternoon. When she comes to my place, we play cards, cook, watch movies and enjoy my gardens.

 

Today, however, may be the last time she ever has me over to her place. With her son gone, she asked me to remove the air conditioner unit from the window in his room. I told her it wouldn’t be a problem.

 

The room was on the second floor of her house, and she stayed on the porch drinking coffee while her daughter and I checked out the a/c unit. It was small, about 30 pounds and would be easy to take out of the window. I pulled off the insulation surrounding it and tried to pull it out but there was a screw holding an L-bracket that the son had installed.

 

Thinking it was just a safety precaution, I got my screw gun, and the screw came out easily. As it fell to the floor the a/c until fell out of the window, trailing its power cord. It fell through the roof of the porch below with a rather unsatisfying amount of noise and screaming by the little girl.

 

My friend screamed as well and said curses I hadn’t heard since breaking up a fight between a couple drunk teamsters.

 

Of course, I’ll pay to have the damage repaired and buy her a new air conditioner, but she is pretty mad at me.

,tifu,"Today started out fucking awesome. I was gonna help one of my greatest homies move back to our hometown. Let's call him C, I'll be accompanied by another buddy, J. J and I left town about noon and drove about 30 mins to the next town over where we found C hanging out with his gf's mom, she's gonna be T. She was driving a Uhaul for him. C had a pretty big distaste for his landlord/roommate which will become important later. I also got myself a red bull and brought no water, which will also become important later. T will stay in the car while us strapping young men take care of business.

Things went very smoothly for us, C's landlord kept butting in but largely left us alone and C was admittedly kind of an asshole to him, which still has me pretty miffed because I think we could've solved what happened next in a civil way. C's landlord was very unhappy because my buddy didn't exactly give notice. We threw a bunch of bags in the trash can and this old man starts throwing a shit fit, he comes out ranting and raving in that righteous drunk old man rage and starts grabbing trash bags out of his trash can and throwing them into the Uhaul. He got one bag in there before I got up in his face and told him to stop being an asshole, I further explained that he could've asked us nicely and we would've taken the bags out of there. He fucked off continuing to rant and I grabbed those bags out of the trash can and set them on the curb for now.

Once we packed everything up, C had gotten everything from the house except some insulin. He started throwing the trash bags back i to the trash can, though J and I had already planned to just take it and toss it elsewhere. I guess C just really hated the landlord. T stepped out with us and J and I watched C start doing this. I immediately knew this old fucking man landlord was about to cause a scene so J and I head back to my car and I hoped things didn't escalate. Well, the old man comes out, starts throwing a fit, and they get into a tussle where I haul my happy ass over to them. T is yelling at them to break it up. By the time I get there, they had broken up but this old fuck goes back inside yelling about some crazy shit, I'm half expecting him to come back packing heat but thankfully he just calls the cops. Unfortunately, C has left his damn insulin inside.

We wait and the police arrive. C and J are hanging out in my car while I sit with T on the back of the Uhaul. The trash is and will remain in the landlord's trash can to be his problem. Right before police arrive, the old guy comes out to T and I and NOW starts trying to be nice to us. He offers us a voucher if we just take the trash to the dump. We tell him that we just want the insulin and we'll gtfo. A cop pulls up while he makes this proposition and he tells to the sheriff that he thinks we got it handled. I yell over him that no, Mr. officer I think you should stick around. As I walk around, low and behold I fucking know the sheriff, which may or may not have helped our case. 

The sheriff is incredibly polite and pretty much takes C's side over the whole thing. He escorts C and the landlord inside and I didn't hear details but that trash was not coming with us and that insulin definitely was. Nobody was arrested and we left the place without further incident. J and I rode together and we were a little peeved at C for instigating but that old dude was definitely an asshole. I was just glad that it was over, and I was thirsty as fuck.

I'm driving home and I start feeling a headache come on once we get into our hometown. I stop and get some water and we continue to the place C will be staying. Once we get there, I help unpack and start feeling real sick out of nowhere. My head and heart are pounding, I was pretty sure I had a migraine coming on. I was sweating like crazy and drank my whole water bottle. I stopped helping and sat down awhile. J gave me some ibuprofen. My buddies definitely could tell I wasn't doing so good and kept checking on me until I told them that I was just gonna head home and lie the fuck down. I am so glad I did, but I think I should've probably taken my happy ass to the hospital.

I got home clutching my head and rushed inside. I vomited up that whole water bottle and all the ibuprofen before I stripped and sat and in the cool shower for like 40 minutes. My eyes especially felt really droopy and I was so, so, so very tired, if that makes sense. That headache might've saved my life because I absolutely could not sleep until it was gone. I suspect it was probably some good old heat exhaustion or heat stroke fever that had set in before I cooled myself down. After I got out of the shower, I lied in bed where my head continued to pound and I weirdly kept forgetting to breathe or was breathing real shallow so I kept kicking on deep, manual breaths until I managed to sip down a little water and 2 more ibuprofen. The head pain subsided, I could drink water if I was slow and laid down on my right side, and I took 2 more ibuprofen and finally felt well enough to fall asleep. I definitely should've gone to the doctor, the more I read the more I think I could've accidentally killed myself had I not cooled myself off ASAP. I woke up about an hour ago, my head is sore as fuck but I feel alright again and I think that today, I fucked up.

,tifu,"So my shitty day starting by driving my two kids to school and kindergarten. My first mistake was dropping the eldest off at school first, causing her to make a huge scene, ""because she wanted to be dropped off last"". Big drama. Tears, yelling, the works. Somehow get her sent to school and the other to kindergarten.

Drive home to work remotely (pretty standard office work). Decide to play some dota 2 to blow off some steam, while attending our regular weekly meeting. It's a pretty basic meeting that is rarely relevant to my work, as it is basically our head manager relaying broad information from the whole company, but I attend in case something of relevance turns up. About 150 people usually attend. I sign in before the meeting starts, mute my webcam and microphone and queue up a game of dota.

As is the case with many video games, things get heated. After about 5 minutes, my lane partner starts flaming me, due to us not agreeing how to play the lane. So I say ""it's way too early to flame bro"" and keep playing. A couple of minutes pass and things are still going poorly. My teammate keeps flaming, and I just can't deal with more shit so I say ""whatever, muted"" and keep playing.

About 30 seconds pass and I notice I'm getting pinged on Teams, Outlook and via texts on my phone. Six different people from different departements are telling me my mic is on and they can hear everything. Mortified, I check the video call. I muted my webcam and *the audio from the video call, instead of my own microphone*. I desperately sign out, sign back in and mute correctly. Apparently our head manager has been saying ""can whoever has their mic on please mute it"" a couple of times already. I thank the people giving me a heads up embarrassed but trying to shrug it off, finish the match while on the call and feel horrible the rest of the day, although not hearing anything else about it.

Anyway, we still one the game, even though I played like shit, we lost all lanes, and we had no business winning it, lol.

,tifu,"Hi, long time lurker here and this one is probably the most embarassing and just totally panic inducing thing I did in my teenage years so yeah it didn't actually happen today but a few years back. I had just started highschool and the school management was just basically non-existent. Chances of there being a garbage bin in the washroom were like 0.002% which is ridiculous considering it was an all girls school. So there was no proper place to dispose used pads and girls would just bring a garbage bag, put the used pad in it and then had to keep it in their school bags which was disgusting ofcourse. We had an empty pocket reserved for that purpose in our school bags. There was only one stall in the floor my classroom was and it was in the balcony area, thankfully the stall had three walls and a door that had a lock. But the sink was in the open, I hope you get the picture. And the school building was facing a two story complex which looked like a haunted house in a narrow lane. There was a big garbage container located right in the front of apartment complex and it's lid was broken so it was always half open.

Now you might know where this is going. So I was on my period and had to change, normally I'd do what everyone did with the used pad which is wrap it in 3-4 layers, put in the garbage bag and into it's reserved pocket in the school bag. But I suddenly got this bright idea of aiming the garbage bag right into the garbage container on the street. And I was on 4th floor. This was the day I accepted that my aim is total shit when the garbage bag in which the pad was landed right at the edge of the roof of the complex. My heart jumped out of my chest the moment I realised what I have done and I started panicking. I went back to class and I was sweating profusely, told my friends what just happened and now all of us were panicking. We went back to check and see if by some miracle it fell down but no, it was still there, unmoved. One friend came up with the bright idea of throwing something else at it to make it fall down but we couldn't muster up the courage because teacher's office was right above.

Now though I had never seen anyone on the roof ever before, I knew that a family with lots of kids lived there and well kids are curious and unpredictable. But this one curiosity could literally traumatize a kid. I imagined the parents suspecting the school because of obvious reasons and making a complaint, then the witch-hunt following it. Gosh, now everyone was panicking and making up scenarios so we took a BLOOD oath that we'd never open our mouths if ever questioned. And it became a daily routine to check on the poor garbage bag sitting on the roof. I had never wished for a thunderstorm so much before but that never happened. Then after 3 months of praying and hoping, it was gone one day, finally out of the sight. Saying I was relieved would be a huge understatement, we even went out for ice-cream to celebrate surviving that lol.

Chances of there being a garbage bin in the washroom were like 0.002% which is ridiculous considering it was an all girls school. So there was no proper place to dispose used pads and girls would just bring a garbage bag, put the used pad in it and then had to keep it in their school bags which was disgusting ofcourse. We had an empty pocket reserved for that purpose in our school bags. There was only one stall in the floor my classroom was and it was in the balcony area, thankfully the stall had three walls and a door that had a lock. But the sink was in the open, I hope you get the picture. And the school building was facing a two story complex which looked like a haunted house in a narrow lane. There was a big garbage container located right in the front of apartment complex and it&amp;#39;s lid was broken so it was always half open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you might know where this is going. So I was on my period and had to change, normally I&amp;#39;d do what everyone did with the used pad which is wrap it in 3-4 layers, put in the garbage bag and into it&amp;#39;s reserved pocket in the school bag. But I suddenly got this bright idea of aiming the garbage bag right into the garbage container on the street. And I was on 4th floor. This was the day I accepted that my aim is total shit when the garbage bag in which the pad was landed right at the edge of the roof of the complex. My heart jumped out of my chest the moment I realised what I have done and I started panicking. I went back to class and I was sweating profusely, told my friends what just happened and now all of us were panicking. We went back to check and see if by some miracle it fell down but no, it was still there, unmoved. One friend came up with the bright idea of throwing something else at it to make it fall down but we couldn&amp;#39;t muster up the courage because teacher&amp;#39;s office was right above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now though I had never seen anyone on the roof ever before, I knew that a family with lots of kids lived there and well kids are curious and unpredictable. But this one curiosity could literally traumatize a kid. I imagined the parents suspecting the school because of obvious reasons and making a complaint, then the witch-hunt following it. Gosh, now everyone was panicking and making up scenarios so we took a BLOOD oath that we&amp;#39;d never open our mouths if ever questioned. And it became a daily routine to check on the poor garbage bag sitting on the roof. I had never wished for a thunderstorm so much before but that never happened. Then after 3 months of praying and hoping, it was gone one day, finally out of the sight. Saying I was relieved would be a huge understatement, we even went out for ice-cream to celebrate surviving that lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR : Aimed a used pad at the garbage container, missed it and it landed on the roof of a complex where a family lived.&lt;/p&gt;

I was sick for 2 days and just sat on the sofa bored and feeling terrible. I clicked on some fitness influencer to see a good exercise (I save good ones to do later myself) and she had a whole bunch of self promoting pictures from holidays and other typical influencer pictures. Scroll down, oh there's another girl showing off her glute progress, and the most effective way for that is to wear very little or shorts/leggings that enhance. Scroll down, and there's some girl with something else along those lines. 
Well, the highly intelligent algorithm decided to do it's job and change my feed from the usual fitness related material with some nerdy topics mixed through, to a page of semi-clad women in bikinis.

My wife, the highly observant woman that she is, noted that it's not like me to spend as much time just scrolling so she decided to open my Instagram and see what I was doing.

,tifu,"Me and my daughter (13) like to prank each other. 

Normal harmless stuff - Fake spiders in wardrobes, sent her a glitter bomb (her mum opened it - we spent the next HOUR cleaning it up and giggling), chillies in food etc.

Whilst cooking dinner I decided to put a fake cockroach in her drink, held down with a straw, so that when she moved the straw, it floats up. It was normal Vimto, so it was purple and thankfully plastic. This bit becomes crucial later. 

I'm thinking this is going to be hilarious.

She sits down to eat, takes a sip, and up floats the cockroach. She spits out her drink laughing/crying. Her mum goes from 0 to 100 really quickly because daughter has just spat. She snatches the cup about to start shouting, notices the cockroach, screams, and throws the drink. 

10 minutes of clearing up later, we sit down to eat, and I'm getting devil eyes off the wife while my daughter is snorting in laughter as she knows I'm in trouble. 

The wife's comment halfway through dinner was, "" Someday you'll act your age, not your shoe size."" and hasn't mentioned it since. Not sure how much trouble, if any, I'm in.

,tifu,"Like the title says, my brain just wasn't working today. (Also, posting this to spread awareness just in case this happens to anyone else).

I was checking my Instagram feed, as you do, when I get a message from one of my bandmates asking me for a favor. I barely know them, but I recognized them as one of my bandmates, so I replied. This person, pretending to be my bandmate, decided to bait me by requesting a code to access their Instagram account.

Part of me thought this was weird, but the logic processing part of my brain hadn't kicked in yet (for context, I'm autistic. This results in a myriad of holes in my social iq. What's relevant to this tifu story, is that my brain sometimes takes longer to process information, hence why some of these red flags took a while to go off in my brain). I then proceeded to give this person a code to my account (stupid ik, but that's what this post is for)

As soon as the red flags started to finally process in my head, I reached out individually to this bandmate via BAND to ask them if it was really them. That's when they confirmed that I'd been had. Before I knew it, I was booted out of my own Instagram account, the link to my Facebook account and phone number was undone, and for a whole 2-ish hours, my Instagram account was no longer mine.

Cue an autism meltdown. For those who don't know what a meltdown is like, it isn't fun. At least for me, my brain just starts spiraling out of control. No matter what I do, my brain just can't get out of what's bothering me in that moment. Furthermore, all of my thoughts and feelings come out in forms of yelling, crying, and rage fits. It's not pretty, ik, but having friends nearby helps.

Eventually, a couple sorority sisters managed to help calm me down, and I managed to get to the screen that this douchebag baited me in with. Instagram had me contact two friends to verify my account so I could reset my password (my mom and one of the aforementioned sorority sisters were who confirmed my account), and what do you know, my account is mine again. As soon as I got my account back, I immediately took precautions to hopefully prevent this whole debacle from happening again.

(Also, posting this to spread awareness just in case this happens to anyone else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was checking my Instagram feed, as you do, when I get a message from one of my bandmates asking me for a favor. I barely know them, but I recognized them as one of my bandmates, so I replied. This person, pretending to be my bandmate, decided to bait me by requesting a code to access their Instagram account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of me thought this was weird, but the logic processing part of my brain hadn&amp;#39;t kicked in yet (for context, I&amp;#39;m autistic. This results in a myriad of holes in my social iq. What&amp;#39;s relevant to this tifu story, is that my brain sometimes takes longer to process information, hence why some of these red flags took a while to go off in my brain). I then proceeded to give this person a code to my account (stupid ik, but that&amp;#39;s what this post is for)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the red flags started to finally process in my head, I reached out individually to this bandmate via BAND to ask them if it was really them. That&amp;#39;s when they confirmed that I&amp;#39;d been had. Before I knew it, I was booted out of my own Instagram account, the link to my Facebook account and phone number was undone, and for a whole 2-ish hours, my Instagram account was no longer mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cue an autism meltdown. For those who don&amp;#39;t know what a meltdown is like, it isn&amp;#39;t fun. At least for me, my brain just starts spiraling out of control. No matter what I do, my brain just can&amp;#39;t get out of what&amp;#39;s bothering me in that moment. Furthermore, all of my thoughts and feelings come out in forms of yelling, crying, and rage fits. It&amp;#39;s not pretty, ik, but having friends nearby helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, a couple sorority sisters managed to help calm me down, and I managed to get to the screen that this douchebag baited me in with. Instagram had me contact two friends to verify my account so I could reset my password (my mom and one of the aforementioned sorority sisters were who confirmed my account), and what do you know, my account is mine again. As soon as I got my account back, I immediately took precautions to hopefully prevent this whole debacle from happening again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, this is something that I wouldn&amp;#39;t wish on anybody, and I&amp;#39;m so lucky that I managed to get my account back. If someone randomly messages you for a favor when you weren&amp;#39;t expecting it, and asks you to send over stuff from your email, please don&amp;#39;t give them anything.&lt;/p&gt;

TIFreakedUp by realizing that it’s my fault my son bites. 
I (24f) have one son, who’s 10 months. He has been off and on teething since August. He now has 7 teeth. Sometimes, he comes over to me or my husband (27m) and will bite (or try to bite) my (covered with a blanket) knee, leg, toes, or more recently, an arm. For the past couple days, I’ve been brushing it off, thinking it’s just a part of him teething, seeing as that’s something he’s definitely done these past couple of months. When he’s teething, he just acts like he desperately needs something to gnaw on it have in his mouth. 

However, something that my family has done growing up, and I know this may sound weird, is we playfully tickle or bite each other (like in the sides or feet usually). It’s something my parents would playfully do to us as little kids, and it’s something my mom and I both do to my son (ex: snatch him up and pretend to eat him, please tell me someone else knows what I’m talking about lol). 
These past couple of days, it seems like when my son bites does it more in a purposeful way, making me think he’s doing it to play. He just doesn’t know how to not bite like he’s actually eating! 

TL; DR So, today I messed up by realizing it’s my fault he bites and I’m not sure how to go about it 😅. On one hand, it’s been a very fun way to play with him — he loves being wrestled and roughhoused.

So I (19M) have a half-sister (26F) from my dad’s side who has borderline personality disorder. 
When I was around 15 she did a few things that deeply hurt my feelings. She lied to my mom and told her all sorts of false things about me. 
I don’t know why but I never was able to let it go. I saw her manipulate people I love around me and just tried to get attention whenever someone in my family wanted to share their success. I had thought about cutting her off a few times but never did because my family invites her to events. (I also want to quickly add that she hangs out with the family from my mom’s side, which isn’t her biologically family. Also important to note that my mom became her stepmother when my sister was 2 years old.)
So yesterday I turned 19. And we had a small conversation via text. I was pretty cold towards her because I just didn’t want to speak to her. 
And today she send me a long message where she told me she’s done trying to stay in contact with me because she’s the only one putting in effort. She said she loved me but just feels hurt every time she interacts with me. 
And then it all hit me. I do want contact with her. I love my sister. And I fucked up big time. I’ve been crying for 1 hour straight being mad at myself. How could I be so cruel and horrible? I’m so mad at myself. My mom has been trying to console me, but I don’t want that. I don’t deserve that. 
I’ve texted her that I wanted to meet up so we could talk. She said she doesn’t want to call but that I’m welcome to come over. 
I’m going to try to go to her tomorrow and say that I fucked up. I don’t expect her to forgive me, but I hope we can start building a relationship again.

,tifu,"TIFU - the other day I was in a meeting with several coworkers discussing a project we are all involved in.  I struggle with one individual, Vikram, because he is rude to women in our meetings and I quite frankly I just don’t like him.  I joined the meeting from my desk which is in an open office and not in the conference room, that was my first screw up.

In all of our past meetings he constantly talks over top of people and repeats himself, asking the same questions or making the same statements over and over.  During this meeting, he wouldn’t stop talking over top of me and another coworker who were trying to explain what we were working on.  I had finally reached my limit and told him to stop talking so that we could finish our explanation.

He didn’t stop, so I asked my female coworkers to leave the meeting then proceeded to chew him out.  I didn’t raise my voice, but I was talking with what my kids would call my mean dad voice, which is low, firm and very direct.  Second screw up.  Like I said, I am in an open office.  I have people all around me.  My manager, “Vijay” who is a director, and the manager above him, “Joe” who is an executive, are within 20’ of my desk and overheard what I was saying.  I told Vikram to shut his mouth and open his ears while I explain the process.  He then yelled over top of me “you can’t tell me to shut up” and I proceeded by saying, “I just did.  Now shut up and listen so I don’t have to repeat myself again.”

Somewhere in the middle of my comments I said that he was acting like a child and if he wanted me to treat him like a toddler I would.  Third screw up.  After that comment he kept quiet, but I could see the door to Vijay’s office close and Joe was in his office asking what the hell was going on with me.  I have worked with these two in various roles for many, many years and they know I don’t ever talk like this to anyone.  I finished my explanation of the process we were developing and our current status, then asked if he had any questions.  Before allowing him to respond I said that if history was any indication I lost him about 3 sentences into my explanation, so I needed to know where I lost him.  He said he didn’t have any questions and immediately left the meeting.

Vijay and Joe were still in Vijay’s office with the door closed when I went to check on Annie, one of my female coworkers who had stayed in the meeting.  This guy has been known to back her into conference rooms and berate her about her part of the project.  She is more than half his age and a recent hire in our company.  By the time I got to her desk, Vikram came storming out of the conference room looking for Joe.  He pulled Joe into the conference room and proceeded to unload everything that had taken place.  As per his normal behavior he talked over top of Joe, I could hear most of what was being said.  He wasn’t too terribly off on his story of what happened.

I met with Vijay for my regular one on one later in the day.  He told me I was out of line and I should never have called Vikram a toddler.  He went on to say I should have joined the meeting in the conference room and going forward I am not allowed to join Vikram’s meeting from my desk.  

My take away is that since I was in an open office and several people overheard me chewing Vikram out, that was the problem.  If I had been in a private conference room I wouldn’t be in trouble.

I struggle with one individual, Vikram, because he is rude to women in our meetings and I quite frankly I just don’t like him.  I joined the meeting from my desk which is in an open office and not in the conference room, that was my first screw up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of our past meetings he constantly talks over top of people and repeats himself, asking the same questions or making the same statements over and over.  During this meeting, he wouldn’t stop talking over top of me and another coworker who were trying to explain what we were working on.  I had finally reached my limit and told him to stop talking so that we could finish our explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t stop, so I asked my female coworkers to leave the meeting then proceeded to chew him out.  I didn’t raise my voice, but I was talking with what my kids would call my mean dad voice, which is low, firm and very direct.  Second screw up.  Like I said, I am in an open office.  I have people all around me.  My manager, “Vijay” who is a director, and the manager above him, “Joe” who is an executive, are within 20’ of my desk and overheard what I was saying.  I told Vikram to shut his mouth and open his ears while I explain the process.  He then yelled over top of me “you can’t tell me to shut up” and I proceeded by saying, “I just did.  Now shut up and listen so I don’t have to repeat myself again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the middle of my comments I said that he was acting like a child and if he wanted me to treat him like a toddler I would.  Third screw up.  After that comment he kept quiet, but I could see the door to Vijay’s office close and Joe was in his office asking what the hell was going on with me.  I have worked with these two in various roles for many, many years and they know I don’t ever talk like this to anyone.  I finished my explanation of the process we were developing and our current status, then asked if he had any questions.  Before allowing him to respond I said that if history was any indication I lost him about 3 sentences into my explanation, so I needed to know where I lost him.  He said he didn’t have any questions and immediately left the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vijay and Joe were still in Vijay’s office with the door closed when I went to check on Annie, one of my female coworkers who had stayed in the meeting.  This guy has been known to back her into conference rooms and berate her about her part of the project.  She is more than half his age and a recent hire in our company.  By the time I got to her desk, Vikram came storming out of the conference room looking for Joe.  He pulled Joe into the conference room and proceeded to unload everything that had taken place.  As per his normal behavior he talked over top of Joe, I could hear most of what was being said.  He wasn’t too terribly off on his story of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met with Vijay for my regular one on one later in the day.  He told me I was out of line and I should never have called Vikram a toddler.  He went on to say I should have joined the meeting in the conference room and going forward I am not allowed to join Vikram’s meeting from my desk.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My take away is that since I was in an open office and several people overheard me chewing Vikram out, that was the problem.  If I had been in a private conference room I wouldn’t be in trouble.  I have been asked to apologize - a genuine apology.  The problem for me is I’m not sorry for what I said or for how the message was delivered.  He had it coming for a long time.  Now, for the first time in my nearly 30 year career I have been put on an “improvement plan”.  &lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"So I recently matched with this attractive girl on a dating app and it turned out she was leaving to another country for school. We spent a couple of weeks getting to know each other sporadically through texts and video calls whenever our schedules and time zones allowed. Things were going pretty great, we had very similar values, life goals and outlooks. Even had some obscure similarities in food, movies and music. 

At one point we were sharing our sense of humor and she hesitantly brought up dark humor. I am totally into that so I encouraged her to share a joke. The day we were having this phone call happened to be 9/11 so she hit me with a 9/11 joke. I thought it was pretty funny and we laughed together. We both agreed that jokes like this aren't meant to belittle the tragedy but rather share a bit of laughter and comfort around the subject.   
She then recommended I watch a stand up special by Daniel Sloss called Jigsaw. Great stand up, by the way, go watch it. The first ten minutes was basically talking about voluntary child abuse. 

This is where I fucked up. Fast forward a week, things are still going great and I heard a pretty dark joke that I found funny. So I decided to send it over to her, thinking she was also into dark and messed up humor like I was. 

The joke was: ""This guy went to a paraplegic strip club the other night. The place was crawling with pussy."" 

Well, following that joke I didn't get a response for two days and then when I asked if it was too dark she just replied she didn't like it. What a glorious way to self-sabotage. Needless to say I think that's a lesson to keep dark jokes until much later in the dating process lmao.

I checked my response and to my horror, my phone autocorrected my sign-off from  ""Thanks in advance,"" to ""Thanks I'm advance."" 

Small mistake not big deal, except it is in this line of work. I'm not even mad if they decided not to continue for that spelling mistake. 

TL:DR there was a grammar mistake on a response email I sent to a recruiter.

I learned how to do laundry a long time ago but never did since. Parents did the laundry so I just kinda tried to do what they did from memory.

I put my load of laundry into the washer and close the door. Next I grab the detergent stuff. I knew for large loads you need to pour more.

Ex- Julian and Old mutual friend- Cole. 


Im not sure even where to start so ill start with the gist. I fell in love with Julian when i was a freshman, i am a junior in hs now. It will be 3 years since our relationship this december. He was tge first peraon that i loved and he was the first memory in my life that was healthy for a good 5 years. I really struggled with mental health issues when i was younger to tge point where i had become a psyche patient at only 10 years old. He always comforted me and i became codependant and didnt realize i even fell in love for the first time until a almost a year after the relationship when my sluislidal ideation and depression became more agressive around 4 months before our anniversary. 

Now to the past week. Julian and i have been talking more and we have finally gotten past the cusp of awkward exs and started becoming friends again around a month ago. This week specifically broke my heart... 4 days ago i get a tezt feom him which was a surprise since i normally reach out first so i immediatly responded. We began talking and it quickly became a non stop rush of questions, reminiscing, and random conversations for 3 days straight. We didnt talk for about 4 hours yesterday and he asked me if i had eaten, which made me tear up quite a bit cuz he only dis that when we dated.. anywho to tge dream last night. I  had trouble sleeping so i texted our mutual friend cole to talk to him about how he was and how julian and i, i think, are getting closer again but i wont have false hope. Cole continued to comment on how cute our conversations were and how he was happy to see julian and i getting closer again. I began to tear up and stopped answering as quickly which prompted cole to call me.out of concern i guess. I immediatly started sobbing and explain that i just want julian to love me like he used to which i knew was selfish and col conforted me through it and even said that i wont know until life shows me that were meant to be in the future. After a couple hours on the phone i fell asleep. This is where the problem starts. I had a dream about me and julian as an older couple with children and grandchildren around a christmas tree...i know this seems childish but the fact that i woke up crying made me realize that i have no idea what to do with myself....i was hoping the internet people couls thats why im writing this. I was in a different state for a school trip last night but that dream hurt me ao bad that i immediatly started driving 7 hours home and came home to talk to my mom. I sat there unable to even talk for about an hoyr before my mom spoke up. The second she spoke i broke down in sikent tears and asked my mom to hold me like i was 5 again. I havent cried tgat loud and hard since my childhood dog died last year in september.... i realize now that i either have to stop talking to him to geal myself but i cant...i mean i cant but...god i dont knoq what to do...can you talk some sense into me? 

Edit: we had a short conversation. I asked him the full reason as to why we broke up and all he could say other than his parents and me not knowing how to process love was "" i dont f***in know i forgot...drank and smoked it all away low key""...ive been on read since i apologized...ig this TIFU has gotten worse.

,tifu,"My (29F) boyfriend ""Alex"" (28M) have been together for 3 years and living together for over 2. We both agree on and plan to get married, but we want to be more financially stable first. We've never had a fight, just a few very calm disagreements and our communication is great 99.9% of the time. This is all to establish that as far as I can tell we have a very healthy relationship and I'm not totally crazy for doing this.

I have a tendency to plan out things that I want to say in my head, but have a terrible memory, so I write them down. I'm also one of those people who always dreamed of getting married. I was single for a lot of my young adult life and had started to be convinced it would never happen. Then I met Alex and was absolutely blown away by happiness. I've never known love like this and we've weathered a few complex life events with no problems. My friends and family love him, his friends and family love me, aside from normal life chaos things are great. 

Now to the meat of the story.
A month or so ago I couldn't sleep and my brain had already been in the mode of ""I wonder what our wedding would look like?"" (which isn't super common but happens). I then thought down the path of what I would say for vows. To be fair, I've been to a handful of weddings but never closely studied the vows so I'm not even 100% sure what I came up with will work, but my brain generated something that sounded like the perfect little speech before leading into the ""I promise to..."" Part. I'm not a writer and usually don't come up with things that pretty so I wrote it down in my notes app. 

Fast forward to last night.
Alex was at a concert with friends. I had plans to meet up with one of my best friends, ""Jess"". They're also in a happy long term relationship and have also been thinking about wedding stuff in general. While talking I without thinking said something along the lines of ""I even kind of started writing my vows so..."". They freaked out and of course wanted to read what I had, and I know they wouldn't tell Alex, so I showed them. Jess of course started crying saying they loved it. The conversation continued, I went home, and Alex got home from his concert too.

Here's where I went wrong. 
I'm terrible with secrets and lies. Ever since I was a kid and had a lie bite me in the ass I just don't. I've found life to be better when open and honest. 
Alex is also friends with Jess and asked how our hangout was. I started to say ""great but I made them cry"" and cut myself after ""but I"" upon realizing what he would ask next and I don't want to lie to him. He obviously realized I had a secret and started playing 20 questions to find out what it was. Like I said I'm horrible with secrets and he managed to figure out that it's some sort of gift but that he won't get it for possibly years. It's worth noting that he HATES both gifts and surprises, they make him anxious, uncomfortable, and feeling indebted. This is when I knew I messed up, because once he knew something existed, I knew he would dwell on it indefinitely and it would bother him. Yes I could have lied and said it was something about Jess and their partner but I was also anxious at that point and picked the wrong cover up. 

After apologizing for knowing that I've created a train of thought that will bug him, and trying to convince him that he would be best off forgetting I said anything, we went to bed. He said he had a dream about solving a puzzle, and throughout the day has been texting me probing questions trying to figure it out. I am obviously not going to reveal any more, and I certainly won't be showing him what I wrote, but I feel bad that this will genuinely bother him for a while. 

Also to anyone thinking ""just tell him something but don't reveal it all"", that might make things worse. We both fully plan to get married but it's not really on our radar anytime soon, and I know he has a lot of anxiety about ""not feeling enough like a grown adult"" especially when it comes to marriage. I should add that we both have stable careers and he is the most emotionally intelligent man I've ever met, so other than saving money and him feeling comfortable with the idea, I don't think there are actually any roadblocks. I'm in no rush whatsoever and will happily wait until he is as enthusiastic about it as I am. If I was to reveal that it had anything to do with our future vows it might make his anxiety worse. He doesn't mind talking about it, weddings are a common topic with many of our friends getting married, but it's not something he thought about prior to our relationship so discussing little details for our own wedding stresses him out a little, his brain just hasn't thought that far yet. I don't want to give him even the slightest idea that I'm trying to rush him, when in reality I'm just living the dream of my inner little girl thinking about her future wedding.

TLDR:
In the midst of a happy long term relationship I randomly thought up part of what I might want to say for my vows at our eventual wedding. My boyfriend hates surprises, and I accidentally revealed that I have a secret after I showed what I wrote to a friend. He is now going to drive himself crazy trying to figure out what it is, which I obviously will not confirm even if he does figure it out.

,tifu,"So I'm currently on a trip to Spain, staying in a hostel.

I was in the shared kitchen on the first night, and wanted to make a cup of tea, but some guy was using the kettle. No issues.

Me: ""Can I use the kettle when you're done?""

Him: ""Why""

Me: ""Uh, I'm just looking to make some tea""

Him, annoyed: ""Why""

Me: ""... I just feel like making a cup of tea, what's the issue""

He turns to me, clearly very irritated, and says the word again, more enunciated, at which point I realise he wasn't saying 'why', he was saying 'wait' in a very strong accent.

At this point a group of people standing nearby are staring at us. One is amused, one is giving me a dirty look, while a third is rolling her eyes. I realise I'm looking like a Karen.

I go red and try to explain that I just misheard the guy but before I could get enough words out he cuts me off really angrily, and one of the girls from the group goes 'leave him alone and have some patience, he will be done soon'.

So anyway I walked away embarrassed, didn't get my tea, and am seriously considering just booking a whole new hostel.

,tifu,"I’ve (24F) worked alongside a male coworker (32M) for a few years now, we have a great friendship and connection. He is married with a daughter who he adores, however doesn’t have a good relationship with his wife. He isn’t happy. He is openly bisexual, and in my mind I’ve always thought he preferred men, so I have always felt really comfortable with him and been affectionate with him. He has never made me feel remotely uncomfortable, we are both affectionate people so we will hug, happy to link arms, hold hands for emotional support. If I need a minute I will put my head of his shoulder, it comes naturally. We will have “flirty” conversations sometimes with others, but nothing directly sex related. I recently left my job so we no longer work together or see each other everyday.

On the weekend we were out drinking with friends, we were both intoxicated and had been holding hands crazy dancing on the dance floor. We went out side to the smoking area alone, on the way there he stopped and faced me and put his forehead on mine and said “I really want to kiss you right now” and he kissed me really gently. 
I pulled away sort of in shock more than anything and we went outside away from people. He held my hands and talked about how much I meant to him and he loves me and wishes we had met earlier in life. He was apologetic and said he didn’t want to make me uncomfortable at all. We kept kissing and then we were making out. I really enjoyed it but I pulled away at times and put my head on his chest and said that we couldn’t door this (married remember). He said he knows and just wanted to have tonight. We kept kissing and he literally made me feel like the only girl in the world. we briefly spoke about implementing boundaries as we don’t want to loose each other or our friendship. (Still tbc) We caught a cab back to our respective homes after.
I love him as a friend and loved kissing him so now things feel a bit different. I really want to kiss him again. We will catch up at an event in about two weeks. Being in shock that night I didn’t get to really know what I was thinking and feeling. But now I feel I can’t stay away. 
In my background I have been taken advantage of by men in the past so this was my first intimate interaction with a man as an adult and that felt safe.

,tifu,"My mom and I were returning from a trip this past weekend and she had been coughing quite a bit during the 7 hour drives. She had just come back from a theme park the week before, so it was safe to assume she caught something out there.

As a precaution, I gave her a Covid test last night and found it was positive. At this point though, we had all been vaccinated and boosted at least 2 times each, so the next day, we masked up and went about our business. We’re in the process of moving and the new house still needs a lot of work. I went to my job for a quick shift. 

My throat was starting to become sore, but I figured that with a day off the next day, if I was to get any worse, I’d have a whole day to be REALLY sick and could make the call if I couldn’t come in afterwards. But aside from the sore throat, I was fine. I wore a tight mask and used my personal bottle of sanitizer more frequently.

A customer tried to call in an order over the phone twice. The first time, my co-worker answered and transferred her to the kitchen. We’re at the lull in our staffing, between the lunch rush and dinner rush, so servers were scarce. As a result, the call bounced back to the front where I answered. She explained that she wanted to place an order, come into the store to pay and then leave. No problem, my co-worker just forgot to radio the kitchen that there was a call on hold. I transfer her again and this time I tell the kitchen to answer.

A few minutes pass and a lady walks in, masked up. Not an uncommon sight in my store, but still somewhat rare. She wants to place a to-go order with a server, explaining that she tried to call in twice, but was never answered. Great, it’s the same lady. Our call-ins are supposed to go through a third party, but for some reason, some calls come through to us and transferring them to the kitchen is hit or miss. Frustrating, but again, no problem. I call up a server and her order finally gets taken.

She toils around the store for a bit, grabbing a few packs of jelly beans. Employee protocol calls for us to hand customers baskets to encourage them to shop more. I walk up to her with a hand basket and politely offer it to her. She thanks me and drops her candies in. I walk away to go back to my register duties.

A few minutes later, she walks up to me and asks if I was okay. And this was where my fuck up happened. I have a bad habit of over sharing at work. Not gross out over sharing or secret-spilling, moreso familial gossip. Still no one’s business. But in my head, Covid is no longer the Plague it used to be. You mask up, wash your hands frequently and only stay home if you’re really sick. Having to isolate for a week is not something you’re required to do anymore, so in my head, I was not nearly as contagious as I could’ve been if I wasn’t wearing my mask and also very sick.

So I told her my Mother was positive, but I was having mild symptoms.

“So you’re saying you were exposed?! I can’t be near you!!”

The next thing I knew, this lady dove into the dining room, placed her hand basket (which we keep on the floors) on a table and raised a stink to my managers. I was called into the office and appropriately reprimanded for over sharing.

On the somewhat bright side though, my managers reassured me that this particular customer was infamous for raising a stink about germs. She would frequently place curbside orders and then demand the servers who brought out her food to take her money so she wouldn’t have to step into the store to pay. She even freaked out when my co-worker touched his face.

The managers cancelled her to-go and walked with me to the front of the store where we watched the lady go out to her car, rub hand sanitizer onto her hair, wrap herself in a fitted sheet and get into her car to drive away. My managers were joking amongst each other over the ridiculousness, but I refused to mock her because this was my fault. That lady was dealing with a mental health crisis and I made it worse by opening my big mouth.

,tifu,"In order to truly express my FU I need to give some context.

In August 2022, I went into a coffee shop I've never been to which is where I met this girl. She works there as a barista and there is a bar top that pretty much faces their workstation. I sat at the bar top and she immediately starts conversing with me. I think she's just being kind but I enjoy our conversation. 

Since then, I have been going to this coffee shop every weekend and we always end up talking. Now, before people say I'm being creepy, I'd like to mention that after the first few weeks, I got a surprise follow request from her on Instagram. I did not give her my info although I'm not hard to find because I have a unique first name. Safe to say she enjoyed our conversations just as much as I did.

Anyways, I found out early that she has a BF she is in a long distance relationship with. He works in a different state while she is still in school. Still, at this point even though I knew there was no chance at dating her, I still enjoyed our conversations. 

Fast forward to April 2024. She has graduated college and quit working at the coffee shop. With that, I also stopped going. I never saw her or talked to her again. The only connection we had now was through Instagram where time to time she would like my stories and I would like hers but nothing more.

Another thing to note is that during the time I got to know her, she told me she did not want to live in the state her BF lives in and that she wants to stay in our current state. So I knew that when she graduates , either her BF would move back or they would break up.

So over the summer, every few weeks I would check her insta to see if she still had pics of her BF posted. Its now September 2024, I go to check her profile and no more BF pics.

I'm excited and nervous. I'm thinking all week if I should just DM her and ask her out. Then, on Sunday Sept 15th, I GET A HINGE LIKE FROM HER.

To my own fault, I got overly excited. Not only was this a girl I was super into but the fact that it was someone I knew prior and IRL made this situation so much better. I can't remember the last time I went on a date with a girl that I didn't know anything about prior to hinge. 

It's also worth noting that over the last couple years i've more or less given up on online dating. I just have not had any genuine connections and every first date feels like the same.

So, yeah, I'm just too excited. Already thinking about our future together. Too much of that, which is not something I ever really do.

So i match and message her on Monday. Say 'hey its been a while' , 'how are you' etc...she responds immediately and then follows up asking for my number so we can swtich to texting (wow she's really into me).

She texts me saying she wants to catch up and I ask if she wants to go out for drinks Friday night so we can catch up in person. She says yes.

So there are mixed opinions of what to do when date night is a few nights away. I try to do minimal messaging of 'hey how does 8pm her sound' one night then maybe the next day say 'hey just want to check if were still on for tomorrow'. I don't want to message too much because I want to have conversations in person.

Well she messages me saying ""I know we're supposed to catch up Friday but I can't wait lol. I want to hear about your new job!"" (WOW she's really into me!)

So we are message pretty heavy back and forth. She is hearting all my messages. It feels like a true love story. Romance is in the air. My heart is beating, I'm smiling, I'm just so happy that this opportunity has come. I'm on cloud 9.

The Wednesday morning I woke up to a cold sore (FML FML). I immediately applied treatment. All day I'm applying treatment to minimize its visibility. Though i prevented it from getting huge, there are still blisters and its noticeable. Thursday is same case. I'm applying treatment all day, looking in the mirror every 20 minutes wondering if I need to re-schedule or if it'll get better. I really really did not want to cancel and just prayed it would be good enough by Friday. 

Its Friday morning. It's improved but still noticeable. Enough that i'm still checking myself out in the mirror every 20 minutes debating if I can see her like this. I'm really trying to hold out hoping its good.

Its Friday at 3pm. 5 hours before date night. I realize too late that I can't be seen like this. It's probably more in my  head than realistically but I made the decision to text her asking to re-schedule. I wanted to be honest but cold sores are something I'm pretty self conscious about and I just felt scared that it would be a major turn off telling her that. So i told her I had a migraine and that I don't see it getting better anytime soon so I want to re-schedule. Ironically, it seems the real turn off was cancelling a few hours before. And looking back, migraine sounds like such a dumb excuse.

She doesn't respond on Friday.  
Saturday morning I send a follow up text telling her how sorry I am. She immedieatly responds and says its no problem. These things happen. She says shes busy all weekend but that we can find time to reschedule again later. I ask if she's free weeknights and would like to meet Monday night. No response rest of Saturday. No response Sunday. Over the weekend i'm checking Hinge to see if she's made any changes to her profile(nope). On Monday no response. I check her Hinge profile again that night and she unmatched me. 

At this point my heart has sunken. I feel like the universe dangled happiness in my face and pulled the rug out from under me. I feel like I've been kicked to the ground. I feel as if every bit of hope and happiness has escaped me. I haven't been able to sleep. I can't stop thinking about this. I'm constantly looking at my phone screen hoping to receive a text I will probably never receive. I am looking upwards to god every hour swearing at the top of my lungs at how un-fucking-believable this timing could have been. To finally get my opportunity for a date with her and a cold sore in the same week! FML! It is 100% my fault for getting too excited about this too early because the disappointment has crashed down so hard on me. I think its hurting because this girl knew me IRL. She was into me. I had already attracted her and then I fucking blew it up. To go from texting everyday to absolute silence. It fucking hurts.

It's Tuesday. I just sent her another message this morning asking how her weekend was but I think its over.

TL;DR: Had a date planned with an amazing girl I've been into for over a year. Got blessed with a cold sore and had to cancel. Tried to reschedule and  haven't heard from her since.",t2_b8p4vu6,False,,0,False,TIFU by cancelling 5 hours before my date due to a cold sore.,[],r/tifu,False,7,L,0,,False,t3_1fomfpi,False,light,0.4,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},L,False,0,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,2024-09-24 20:25:24,text,7,,,text,self.tifu,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to truly express my FU I need to give some context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2022, I went into a coffee shop I&amp;#39;ve never been to which is where I met this girl. She works there as a barista and there is a bar top that pretty much faces their workstation. I sat at the bar top and she immediately starts conversing with me. I think she&amp;#39;s just being kind but I enjoy our conversation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have been going to this coffee shop every weekend and we always end up talking. Now, before people say I&amp;#39;m being creepy, I&amp;#39;d like to mention that after the first few weeks, I got a surprise follow request from her on Instagram. I did not give her my info although I&amp;#39;m not hard to find because I have a unique first name. Safe to say she enjoyed our conversations just as much as I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I found out early that she has a BF she is in a long distance relationship with. He works in a different state while she is still in school. Still, at this point even though I knew there was no chance at dating her, I still enjoyed our conversations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to April 2024. She has graduated college and quit working at the coffee shop. With that, I also stopped going. I never saw her or talked to her again. The only connection we had now was through Instagram where time to time she would like my stories and I would like hers but nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to note is that during the time I got to know her, she told me she did not want to live in the state her BF lives in and that she wants to stay in our current state. So I knew that when she graduates , either her BF would move back or they would break up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So over the summer, every few weeks I would check her insta to see if she still had pics of her BF posted. Its now September 2024, I go to check her profile and no more BF pics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m excited and nervous. I&amp;#39;m thinking all week if I should just DM her and ask her out. Then, on Sunday Sept 15th, I GET A HINGE LIKE FROM HER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my own fault, I got overly excited. Not only was this a girl I was super into but the fact that it was someone I knew prior and IRL made this situation so much better. I can&amp;#39;t remember the last time I went on a date with a girl that I didn&amp;#39;t know anything about prior to hinge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also worth noting that over the last couple years i&amp;#39;ve more or less given up on online dating. I just have not had any genuine connections and every first date feels like the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, I&amp;#39;m just too excited. Already thinking about our future together. Too much of that, which is not something I ever really do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So i match and message her on Monday. Say &amp;#39;hey its been a while&amp;#39; , &amp;#39;how are you&amp;#39; etc...she responds immediately and then follows up asking for my number so we can swtich to texting (wow she&amp;#39;s really into me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She texts me saying she wants to catch up and I ask if she wants to go out for drinks Friday night so we can catch up in person. She says yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are mixed opinions of what to do when date night is a few nights away. I try to do minimal messaging of &amp;#39;hey how does 8pm her sound&amp;#39; one night then maybe the next day say &amp;#39;hey just want to check if were still on for tomorrow&amp;#39;. I don&amp;#39;t want to message too much because I want to have conversations in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well she messages me saying &amp;quot;I know we&amp;#39;re supposed to catch up Friday but I can&amp;#39;t wait lol. I want to hear about your new job!&amp;quot; (WOW she&amp;#39;s really into me!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are message pretty heavy back and forth. She is hearting all my messages. It feels like a true love story. Romance is in the air. My heart is beating, I&amp;#39;m smiling, I&amp;#39;m just so happy that this opportunity has come. I&amp;#39;m on cloud 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wednesday morning I woke up to a cold sore (FML FML). I immediately applied treatment. All day I&amp;#39;m applying treatment to minimize its visibility. Though i prevented it from getting huge, there are still blisters and its noticeable. Thursday is same case. I&amp;#39;m applying treatment all day, looking in the mirror every 20 minutes wondering if I need to re-schedule or if it&amp;#39;ll get better. I really really did not want to cancel and just prayed it would be good enough by Friday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its Friday morning. It&amp;#39;s improved but still noticeable. Enough that i&amp;#39;m still checking myself out in the mirror every 20 minutes debating if I can see her like this. I&amp;#39;m really trying to hold out hoping its good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its Friday at 3pm. 5 hours before date night. I realize too late that I can&amp;#39;t be seen like this. It&amp;#39;s probably more in my  head than realistically but I made the decision to text her asking to re-schedule. I wanted to be honest but cold sores are something I&amp;#39;m pretty self conscious about and I just felt scared that it would be a major turn off telling her that. So i told her I had a migraine and that I don&amp;#39;t see it getting better anytime soon so I want to re-schedule. Ironically, it seems the real turn off was cancelling a few hours before. And looking back, migraine sounds like such a dumb excuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She doesn&amp;#39;t respond on Friday.&lt;br/&gt;
Saturday morning I send a follow up text telling her how sorry I am. She immedieatly responds and says its no problem. These things happen. She says shes busy all weekend but that we can find time to reschedule again later. I ask if she&amp;#39;s free weeknights and would like to meet Monday night. No response rest of Saturday.

,tifu,"Last week, my mother had my cousins down to the house to stay. I wasn't entirely excited about this as it was going to be an extremely hectic two weeks for me at work. I was retroactively denied time off due to understandable circumstances, and my workload was about to triple, but I had it in writing that I was likely going to get the newly available supervisor role with this trial period went great. Massive pay bump too.

What this meant was I wasn’t going to be able to see my gaming cousins much, which was an absolute bummer, but I still had some evenings we could talk. At least, I thought that was going to be the case. Anytime I got home after work, they were in the spare room together gaming with each other on their Switches. I was able to join in on their LAN games, but they never once left the room unless it was for the bathroom or something.

I never asked anyone why they kept to the room. It just didn’t cross me. In my house, when the door is closed, they want privacy. Admittedly, I was a little disappointed, as I was under the understanding they were into board games and was hoping to play some Settlers or 7 Wonders with them. Since my brother moved out and my friends across the country, I’ve been a bit starved for board gaming.

This went on for the whole week, the only time I saw them was when they went to the Bathroom we shared. (IMPORTANT)

Friday at work was an extremely busy day trying to get everything done before the weekend. I was rushing between everyone making sure things kept going, and my adrenaline was extremely high. I didn’t even register that anything was wrong until I got home that evening and absolutely crashed.

I felt weak, dizzy, my strength absolutely sapped. As a result, I didn’t even talk to my parents, I just called it an early night and went to bed.

I was feeling absolutely horrible Saturday, fever, headache, upset stomach, and the water I took with my medication tasted like a Switch Gaming Cartridge. I was sick. I went downstairs to get something light to eat, and my dad pushed one of the COVID test kits into my hands. That's when the shoe dropped.

The reason why my cousins were not leaving the spare room was because they were quarantining themselves. They caught COVID from a wedding they went to five days before they came to visit, and no one bothered to inform me. Hell, I am kicking myself that I didn't realize it out sooner. Worst off, I was sharing a bathroom with them while my parents were using the downstairs bathroom. I didn’t ask, no one told me. It just completely slipped my mind.

Of course I had it and the next three days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) was hell on Earth. Despite having all my shots up to date to say it was the worst I felt ever would be an understatement. It could have been a lot worse, but today, Tuesday, I felt good enough to return to work with proper precautions in place to ensure it would not spread…

But it was too late.

Remember when I said that Friday I was rushing between everyone to make sure things kept running. This involved handling things, passing it to others, talking to others, and ensuring quality of prints. Where I live, COVID Regulations are not mandatory, it's basically “Use common sense, if you have it, wear a mask, clean up your area, don’t be an idiot.” Now we can add “Don’t be an uninformed MORON” to that list.

It started with two people calling in sick. Then, one by one my team started feeling sick and ill. Some were more resistant and able to continue working, but a lot just asked to leave early. Someone used one of the tests provided by the company, and yep, they have it. Not just them, but after they were confirmed the rest of the team took the test and everyone save for the one person I don’t interact with caught it (and I don't think thats going to last long). Because the one person I don’t interact with was the only one who didn’t catch it, it was easily traced back to me as Patient Zero.

My boss said he is going to stick up for me, argueing their should be no disciplinary actions against me for being careless or not adhering to due diligence. I was genuinely uninformed, and the moment I learned I emailed my boss to do a wipe down of the facility, but it was too late. Right now I am sitting in an empty print shop, three quarters of my team missing, still have a headache, and brainstorming with my boss about how we are going to get out of this mess.

Right now the only thing that has been set in stone is Face Masks and Hourly Wipe downs are coming back into effect, which the team is just going to absolutely love but won't help right now.

I don’t think I am going to get that Supervisor position. I am sure my direct boss will stand up and fight for me, but an entire facility shutting down from me, that’s going to be hard to ignore.

I had a good eye appointment as usual and then went to buy my glasses. The place I go is usually more expensive, so I expected it to be more.

I didn't really remember what I got. Then, after a while, I get told the total. I wasn't asked anything else. The total was nearly $300. Last time, I didn't pay that much and I asked if all my insurance got applied. I was told yes and your paying for the anti-coating. I asked once more and was told it's correct.

I couldn't remember, so I figured must be right. The price just seemed wrong to me. I have to pay before seeing the charges or getting the reciept. I pay, get a sheet about a warranty, and then I see a warranty in addition to the other charges. I was never asked about a warranty. 

I don't know why, but I didn't check until after in my account how much I paid last year ($110) and I knew I had the files from last year. I check it, last year my anti-coating was a different type (which is covered) and I didn't get a warranty.

,tifu,"Well if there ever was a case for bad timing, bad luck, and bad sex, this would be it…

I (25M) met a woman (24F) on Tinder and after some time talking, invited her over to my place for some dinner and to play some games of Mario Kart. We added a twist where for each race a person loses, they must remove one article of clothing. What ended up ensuing was multiple competitive rounds, but in the end I won. From there things escalated very quickly and progressed from making out, to both our clothes coming off, eventually reaching the point of us having sex.


Here’s where the fuck up of the fuck down comes in: In the middle of it things were rough and heavy, and she starts to say her lips are getting itchy, and while this is happening I can see her breasts, thighs, and many other parts start to turn red.

We stop and she asks me if the dinner we had, had any sort of seafood in it, and that she has a severe allergy to fish. It was not in the dinner, but in all of that I remember that I had salmon for lunch, and I kissed her in many spots on her body…

I tell her what happened, after which she immediately gets dressed back up, grabs her bag and immediately runs to her car and speeds off, presumably I think to go to a hospital.

I tried calling and texting her but got no response to both. More than anything I wanted to make sure she was okay, and if it was a bad allergy attack to the point of anaphylaxis I was willing to go with her and drive her to the hospital considering this whole situation was my fault.

After 3 days she texts me a short paragraph basically saying i’m a sweet guy but she wasn’t feeling a spark. I feel horrible about this and I feel like me causing the allergy attack probably contributed to her decision.

I had my fresher night yesterday, and my friends and I were enjoying the vibe of the DJ; the room was closed, tiny (for 900 students), and quite hot with no air conditioning, due to which the floor was slippery as fuck; I was jumping and dancing like crazy, and in some moments my leg slipped inwards, and I had a crack sound in my ankles and knees (i crack my knees often so not a big issue for me, but the ankles scared the shit out of me because this type of shit had never happened to me before). I rushed outside the crowd (because of adrenaline) and fell as soon as I passed the crowd. A guy(fresher) helped me check both my legs out and brought my chair so I could sit properly with my legs well-rested; halfway through the checking, my friends also came to help me. They called the security guards so we could call for an ambulance to the medical center (I could not walk). We had to fucking wait for the ambulance for 20 mins while it was just inside my campus. Till then, I informed my father about it; he got worried and scolded me for dancing/jumping and said that I was too careless (but I told him to chill down a bit). When I was in the medical center, the doctor said it was just a sprain(both the ankles), but he would need to examine it tomorrow (that being today). I came back and told him everything; he then told my mom when I went to sleep (my mom resides in a different country). I slept a lot and missed one of the meds prescription that was given by the doctor the night before. 



Now, I woke up and called my mom. She started to yell at me that I had lost all of my schedule/discipline (a bit back context on it: The last whole week, I had a lot of quizzes and a butt load of assignments {for clubs and departments that I have joined or trying to join and was trying to squeeze out time my from sleep/classes for that}} and not maintaining a fucking proper schedule that I should follow. I told her I was trying to get a proper schedule, but the load was too much, and this went on for 20 minutes. She had to sleep, so she hung up.



I went back to the medical center (the doctor told me to) and got my X-ray done from a hospital outside my campus. A minor fracture in the right ankle (it was written ""?undisplayed fibula fracture""). The general doctor said tomorrow, the orthopedic will come and check on you to see if you require a plaster or not. I told my father everything; he was quite chill about it now (my mom was sleeping, so I was unable to talk with her).



Back again, my mom woke up and started to scold me. She said, ""You've changed a lot since you went to university."" Not talking with us as you used to (the amount of time), and to be honest, I am to be blamed here as I feel like she will scold me if I say, ""I am going somewhere inside the campus"" or ""Hanging out with my friends"" maybe I am being too judgemental and harsh (she doesn't do that normally), but I feel like I have already disappointed my parents a lot and don't want to disappoint more.

,tifu,"My husband recently went to the doctor for routine blood work/checkup and the doctor suggested a magnesium supplement to help him get to sleep at night. I thought, great! We have magnesium, I've been taking it for years. Husband points out that the doctors specified magnesium glycinate. We have magnesium oxide. Didn't think much if it other than the doctor had mentioned less stomach upset with the glycinate. We promptly got busy and I forgot to order the supplement until last night. 

A little history, I've been taking magnesium since I was a teenager on and off. I have chronic anxiety. Back then, we called them my happy pills, and it's possible that they were actually the glycinate because they seemed to help my mood. But once I was out in my own I either didn't take them, or just went to the drug store and bought whatever supplement was available. Generally the Natures Best Magnesium, which as verified last night is magnesium oxide. I go through phases where I take it, and have taken it based on doctor's recommendation even, but I have never noticed any improvement in mood. This last go around, the only benefit I noticed was that if I took two it would clear up some constipation with some diarrhea.

As we were laying in bed last night, hubby asked if I ever ordered his magnesium and as I hadn't we went down the rabbit hole of trying to remember which specific magnesium we needed and I got curious, so googled the difference between oxide and glycinate. The first response was that oxide is used to treat things like constipation and glycinate is used for things like anxiety and sleep. Anxiety and sleep is what I've always been told, yet have not in almost two decades felt the result of.

Two decades of shitty sleep that led eventually to a sleep specialist that told me I'm perfectly fine. At least 15 years of trying to manage anxiety with various meds and doctor visits, weekly therapy, and finally most recently after a panic attack that put me in the ER, a psychiatrist. I'm not saying that taking the right supplement would have changed any of that, but I have spent the last two decades thinking magnesium just doesn't do anything for me. When it turns out I've been taking the wrong supplement the whole time. 

And as icing on the cake, as I went down my google rabbit hole last night, I ended up on a reddit thread what when I exited out of left me on my reddit home page on my phone, to be immediately informed that an iconic musician in our community was tragically killed in a horrible motorcycle accident. Something I would have learned eventually, but really didn't need to find out as I was trying to go to sleep. Just because I'd put my book down to google magnesium.

,tifu,"I have been eyeing this guy for a while but i was too scared to initiate the conversation cause he was friends with people with whom i don’t have a good relation so I thought he would know about this thing cause they are homies. Anyway, he used to reply to my stories and then we started chatting casually and  we have been talking online for a while. 

I really liked talking to him. He was funny, had a good taste in movies and films. Only issue was he didn’t reply me on time and i confronted him once or twice about it but he explained that he is not much of a texter(?) but slowly he started changing this habit and used to reply me with 1-2 hrs. 

So fast forward to today, we decided to meet and we did meet. We went to a bar, had couple of drinks. Yapped a lot. It was perfect. But then he casually told me that he is checking out some girl at the table. At first I was like “haha yeah right as if she’d choose you” like in a fun frolicking way. Then he started checking out other girls randomly and he was telling all these to me. I was getting uncomfortable and sad cause i was literally sitting in front of him and all he could see was the other girls. 

I had a lot to drink and so i confronted him then and there like why would you check out other girls when you’re out with me? So he was like why shouldn’t I? If you want you can do the same too? I was like no why would I, I am literally here with you. My whole focus should be on you. It’s a bit rude. So then he goes like what do you think this is? Do you think this is a date because I thought it was a simple meet and greet. 

Now here I knew that this might be platonic from his end but u was being delusional and thought no it might not. So I told him yeah I thought it was a date and I like you. I like talking  to you and I was looking forward to meet you.  Here he went completely cold and distant and he went like see i didn’t realise this was the case for you cause from my end i have been very clear that it’s a casual hangout for me. If i have some feelings for you later, i would tell you but now I don’t but I really liked spending time with you and u would like to meet again. I asked him how do you want to hang out the next time we meet to that he replied casually only and not to expect anything else. 

This went on and i returned home. We texted a little bit talking about the same thing and he was being completely honest about his feelings which I appreciate and I also agreed to be friends with him. 

But today morning he has not replied to my texts. He’s posting stories and everything. Completely ignoring me. I think I fucked up a perfectly good relationship by being dumb and I am so embarrassed.

If i have some feelings for you later, i would tell you but now I don’t but I really liked spending time with you and u would like to meet again. I asked him how do you want to hang out the next time we meet to that he replied casually only and not to expect anything else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This went on and i returned home. We texted a little bit talking about the same thing and he was being completely honest about his feelings which I appreciate and I also agreed to be friends with him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today morning he has not replied to my texts. He’s posting stories and everything. Completely ignoring me. I think I fucked up a perfectly good relationship by being dumb and I am so embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I messed up a perfectly good relationship by misunderstanding the situation and now i can’t stop spiralling  over it. &lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"Obligatory disclaimer - this did not happen today. 

So I actually f'ed up earlier in this month but only realised very much recently. Our team has an overseas work trip in October and we were supposed to book our own hotels. My manager requested for me to help her book her hotels as well, which I did (via her app). 

Where I f'ed up was when another colleague suggested a change of hotel. Now, I had to cancel and change one of the bookings. And I also had to do the same for my manager. And it was a very rushed day at work so I didn't double check the dates. This is where I screwed up - I mistakenly booked for Sep instead of Oct. And I didn't realise it until weeks after. 

When I realised, it was too late and the dates had passed, I couldn't cancel it. I was out 1k from my mistake. The mistake was compounded as I came in to work on Monday to realise I made the same mistake for my manager's booking, and she requested me to compensate her for her loss which amounted to 1.2k.

Now I'm really depressed as I've essentially lost about half my monthly salary due to 1 stupid mistake in a wrong month entry.

,tifu,"A bit of background for the story’s sake:
I (32 M) live with my soon to be spouse (32), in the “in-law unit” of the house that our friends  have. I work from home, so our little unit is essentially a bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, and instead of a living room I have my workspace and the den in the big house is communal to all six of us so long as it’s kept up with. 

In the morning long before I wake up, my partner will leave post it notes around if they need something for me since they work the crappiest hours.  This is normally stuff like when to heat up the dinner already prepped so he can eat and pass out when he gets home or asking to grab something from the house he left in the den, etc. 

This morning he asked me to clean the den up after him. Not the first time; we’re all friends but some of us have different habits, work schedules, whatever so sometimes I wind up just doing it anyway cause I’m home and wanna be in a clean space. When I walked into the den I couldn’t help but wonder if I missed a party or something. 

I don’t know who all was involved still, or what but when I saw the mess it looked like a group of freshly made pledges should be cleaning I just walked away. I made sure the big houses pets weren’t able to get to the mess, then went out till about an hour ago (11 pm) after having my phone of DND for most of the day. I’m used to cleaning bc I want to, not bc I have to. I’m an adult, and so is everyone else so I hated thinking they could take advantage of me being the only one home all day. 

 Here’s the thing. I missed some post it notes in the den that my partner assumed I’d see while I was cleaning. One of these was apparently  along the lines of “wake (housemate) up, you don’t have to do this all by yourself hes gonna do most of it!” Which is great bc when he did eventually wake up w/o me getting him he just did it so it’s not like everyone came back to ants or anything. 

However, some of them were more for just my partner and I. Like “take meat out of freezer, I’ll be home early want wanna cook for us” … or, y know, more importantly “please charge my arm, I wanna cook for us!”

Yeah. So. My partner has (a few kinds of) prosthetic arms. He uses the bionic for more “delicate” work but he’s still not very used to it and loses things so 1) I keep track of the charger and 2) he needs help putting it on and taking it off. From what I’ve gathered he got help from housemates to set the arm on and gather unfrozen meat to start cooking “for when I come home”. Due to housemate cleaning the den before and not mentioning I wasn’t around to help, no one knew that I was angry or when/where I went since I wasn’t answering my phone. 

Well. The arm died when he was cooking, attaching him to the oven under the stove. He tried to continue cooking I guess, while also trying to undo the mechanic that locked the arm in place, and was shouting out the window to the main house hoping someone would hear him. I still don’t have all the details but it was about half an hour until someone got to him and longer than that for them both to get the arm undone so he wasn’t attached anymore. In the fight with it, he stumbled and burned his hand on the pan on the stove and left the arm hanging from the oven for me to fight with later. 

He’s upset so I’m sleeping in my “work space” to give him room. Our relationship isn’t going to be ruined by this or anything and I’m sure we’ll laugh about it eventually… but yeah foresight really is 20/20. 

TLDR; I left a messy house + ignored my phone when my partner was cooking my favorite meal in return for cleaning, but his robot arm shut down resulting in him being stuck to the oven for almost an hour and he got a minor burn on his good hand.

TIFU and got maced 

So, I took a trip to California this weekend to take care of my DUI, and of course instead of solving my legal issues, I created more of them.

I decided since I was alone, what better to do then go find trouble. I’d walk down West Hollywood and have some drinks. 

I drink a lot as is and I had been boozing heavily in the last week with my buddies down south. This means I wasn’t holding back and probably had around 10-15 doubles of Jame-O. Fast forward to the last bar I was at, I was completely black out at this point and don’t remember leaving.

However I do remember waking up in a frenzy. You know when you come out of a blackout and become conscious again. Well when this happened my face, eyes, and skin were on fire, and a rather large older “rent a cop” (neighborhood security) was standing in front of me. He lets me know that he had maced me. Of course he also tells me that I “punched him in the chest”, I was definitely not at my air bnb, but in front of some high end house in a very nice neighborhood on the porch. How nice of my brain to basically shut down for the first part of me being maced in my face. As a result of all of this I began to yell in the face of the neighborhood watch, and in doing so spread the mace to all sorts of places on my body. In retrospect I could’ve probably just ran considering the age and weight of this guy, and because technically he wasn’t a police officer. So if you’re familiar with LAPD, they are extremely slow to respond to any disturbance call. I got to sit on the ground and call this loser names for about 3 hours while my skin marinated in mace!  By the time LAPD arrived the owner of the home showed up and was just as confused as I was, luckily he didn’t press charges for trespassing. Lucky me, and because of all the commotion the neighborhood watchmen citizen arrested me, and it was time for my super chill trip to the holding station. Two lovely Latina police officers showed up and escorted me to holding. 

Once there I was allowed to use the restroom, and buddy, no one told me I should’ve held my member with a paper towel. I got to feel what it would be like if icy hot challenge met bear mace for a long time in a holding cell by myself. Now I have a battery charge and didn’t finish the DUI as I planned on doing. So, I spent 250 dollars on drinks, then got maced, spread it to my underside and had to walk 3 miles back to my place with 2 percent battery. I think it’s time I stopped drinking.

The best part is no one also told me that showering resets the mace! AND, according to Google all you can do is stand in front of a fan and wait for the mace to dissipate. ITS really cool that mace has almost no solutions that work quickly, and I got to get home at 7 am and sleep for 2 hours before the pain wouldn’t let me sleep!

,tifu,"My fiancé and I got some rare alone time and we wanted to make the best of it. We have super busy schedules lately so finding time to be intimate has been difficult. 

We discovered very quickly that we were out of condoms. He went to the store as fast as he could and grabbed the first box he could see, and came back home. When he put it on he said it felt a little tight and after a few seconds he said he was going soft. 

I figured I should be a good fiancée and help him out so I had him lay down and I gave him head until he was hard again and then a little longer for good measure. He didn't take the condom off so we didn't have to deal with him trying to put one on again and potentially going soft so I just sucked him off with the rubber on. We successfully had sex and then almost immediately afterwards, I realized I couldn't feel my lips or tongue. 

 He said his lips felt tingly too but we didn't know why. He decided to check the condom box to see what they were made out of. Apparently whatever he bought had some kind of numbing stuff on it to make the guy last longer, which adds up cause it took him absolutely forever to finish. So when I sucked his dick I got the numbing stuff all over my mouth and didn't even realize it because I was so into the foreplay and sex, and then when I kissed him during sex I transferred the numbing agent to him and gave us both a numb tongue. 

I couldn't drink water without dribbling it for a good twenty minutes and even slurred my speech a little bit because I couldn't use my tongue to properly speak.

,tifu,"I'm posting this to get it off my chest about how disappointed I am with myself after messing up what I thought was a dream opportunity.

For the past few months, I've been going through an intense interview process for an Enterprise Architect position at Universal Studios. It was the 8th round of interviews, and I had already provided references, including at least two previous managers from my current company. Passing these references meant my current employer now knew I was looking for a new role.

The position was a perfect fit for me because I was already doing exactly what the job description outlined in my current role. The world around me was aligning in a way that made this experience feel like it was the role to have—it was going to be the fresh start I was needing in life. Being involved with an industry that I could be proud to work for because it focuses on providing experiences and distractions to millions of people a year (yes, it's all about the money, but the people going to these parks are also trying to get away from life). It felt like a **shoe-in**—everything the company was looking for was right there in my experience. Life events were happening around me that pointed me down this path, making it feel like the stars were aligning for this opportunity. During the interviews, they quizzed me on things I was already excelling at in my current role, which made me feel even more confident about landing the job.

After the references, I was told I needed to have a 30-minute conversation with the CTO and a manager in HR. They couldn't schedule both in the same meeting, so I ended up having the meeting with the HR rep right as COVID was kicking in. The meeting with the HR rep went really well—she was thrilled with me and even asked if I wanted a job in HR, which was both unexpected and flattering. However, shortly after, my COVID symptoms took a turn for the worst, and my body told me to stay in bed.

Wednesday was the big day: my final virtual interview with the CTO's direct report. Unfortunately, I was in the midst of my 3rd day of COVID symptoms. I had been bedridden for two days, feeling absolutely horrible, but I didn't want to let the opportunity slip away or disrespect their time. So, I decided to power through and attend the interview while still recovering.

During the interview, I tried my best to put on a good face and answer the questions, but deep down, I knew I wasn't at my best. I did mention that I had COVID, hoping it would provide some context, but I fear that my performance didn't reflect my true capabilities and leadership skills because of how sick I was.

A few days ago, I received an email from HR informing me that I wasn't selected for both the role I had originally applied for but also another position I wasn't even aware I was being considered for. It hit me hard because this was a dream opportunity, and I feel like I messed it up by not rescheduling the interview when I was so unwell.

I'm now reaching out to the recruiter to see if there's any chance for reconsideration or another interview, but I'm unsure if that's even possible. This whole experience has been taking a toll on me mentally, feeling like I let myself and potentially the company down.

I feel like I have let myself down and even though they say everything is fine, I feel like I have let my family down. The past couple of years have been a struggle for us as a family because we can't seem to figure out which direction we want to go in life. With all the things aligning, like they were, this seemed like the option that would finally be the path forward for us all... only to be pulled out from under us due to me not putting myself first. Now, I sit here, not able to mentally align myself towards anything, and the reality of the world around me, of the things that I was going to be able to get away from or not have to deal with by going down this path, are starting to overwhelm me more.

Looking back, I should have prioritized my health and communicated better about needing to reschedule. Instead, I tried to tough it out and paid the price.

  
**TL;DR:** I regret not prioritizing my health and letting my illness affect this dream opportunity. I went through 8 rounds of interviews for an Enterprise Architect position at Universal Studios, which perfectly matched my current role. During my final interview with the CTO’s direct report on Wednesday, I was seriously ill with COVID-19 but didn’t reschedule. My poor performance led to rejection from both the role I applied for and another position I wasn’t aware of.

,tifu,"So, this happened earlier today, and I’m still dying of embarrassment. I work in an office where we use a messaging app for communication (you know, typical corporate stuff). I’ve always been super careful with who I’m messaging, but today I managed to make the mother of all mistakes.

I have a friend who also works in the same company, and we’ve been passing the time by sending each other funny GIFs throughout the day to keep our spirits up. You know the ones — ridiculous, sometimes a little inappropriate, but all in good fun.

Anyway, I was in the middle of a boring workday when I came across *the* perfect GIF for my friend. It was this clip of a cat slapping another cat while the words ""Shut the F\*\*\* Up"" flashed across the screen. A little aggressive, but hilarious in context (we’d just been talking about how annoying someone in the office was being).

I clicked on the GIF, hit send, and immediately continued with my work like nothing had happened. A few minutes later, I saw a notification pop up. My stomach dropped. It wasn’t my friend who replied. It was my BOSS.

Turns out, I didn’t send the cat slap GIF to my friend. I sent it to my boss. And not just any boss—*the* boss. The CEO of the company. The guy who literally signs my paycheck.

Cue full-on panic mode.

I quickly opened the message thread and there it was: the aggressive cat slap GIF, sent directly to the CEO with absolutely zero context. No “Hey, sorry, wrong message!” or “This was meant for someone else!” Just a GIF of a cat telling the CEO to shut the f\*\*\* up. I was horrified.

My immediate instinct was to try and fix it. I started typing out an apology, but then stopped. *What the hell do I even say?!*

""Uh, sorry for telling you to shut up with a violent cat, Mr. CEO? I was trying to send that to a friend who was venting about their lunch break?""

I panicked, deleted the draft, and left it on read. My brain was screaming, and I had no idea how to handle this situation. So, I did what any rational person would do—I turned off my computer and pretended it didn’t happen.

Fast forward to about an hour later, and I’m still sweating bullets, checking my phone every five seconds to see if I’ve been fired via email. Then, suddenly, a reply notification comes through. Heart pounding, I open it.

And this is what I see:

“Aggressive, but I like it. Let’s keep the meetings short today.”

My jaw hit the floor. Not only did he not fire me, but he actually responded with...a joke? Was this real life? I don’t know if I’m in the clear yet, but at least for now, I still have a job.

Moral of the story: *Always check who you’re sending GIFs to.* Or better yet, maybe don’t send your boss a cat slap meme at all.

,tifu,"So I was dating my then girlfriend at the time for about 10 months. We'd obviously been talking for a little longer than that. From the beginning of our relationship we basically lived together on the weekends. Spending the night at each other's houses from Friday night until Sunday night. We'd also see each other Thursday nights and text every night. The last month of our relationship was a little shaky.

She'd been looking another job for a while and I was trying to help her in her search. I actually found her the program that she's currently enrolled in. We'd also talk about it over text every night.

So one Saturday we went out with a friend and came back and I played some video games. This was only the second time I played my Xbox in front of her. After a while she got upset and said that I love the game more than her. I didn't really take that comment seriously because I'd tell her I love her every day but I stopped and hugged her but she said it was too late. She said she was stressed about her job related stuff and after I saw her get really upset I just turned it off but she was crying and decided to sleep in another room. At some point she came back in the room and the next morning was awkward. I didn't even know how to react to her because I was surprised she got that upset. She ended up storming out of my house and said that I wasn't there for her.

After she left I found out she texted her ex as soon as she got home. I never brought this up and I don't think it would've made things better if I did. I texted her to see if she was alright and I apologized and said I was here for her. Admittedly I didn't think I was the bad guy and did anything that egregious but I just told her sometimes I like doing my own thing but I still loved her. I never played video games in front of her again. We still spent the remaining weekends together in their entirety.

I felt bad because I made her upset. I just wanted to have fun on the Xbox for a little while after a long week and a night out. I apologized and never played video games in front of her again. But that was when she started talking to her ex and now she's going back to him.

,tifu,"The fuck action didn't happen today, but the ticking time bomb caused by my actions in the past exploded today.

All because of fucking Threads.

Way way back last year, when Threads launched, I checked it out. Used it for a couple days. Did a post, followed some accounts, and then proceeded to ingore it ever-after. Here is where the fuck up was planted.

Amongst the brand new (at the time) Thread accounts I was following, I followed a bunch of content creators associated with Rooster Teeth. This included all the big names; Gavin, Geoff, Jack, Blaine etc.... and some of their partners that show up in content and voice actor/actresses on their shows. This is was the fuck up. 

I followed some ladies, such as Meg Turney, Jessica Nigri, and Lindsay Jones.

I know they cosplay, but I'm not a big fan of that side of theor content. I recognise they do it well and move on if I ever see it, which is rare nowadays as I use social media very little. Never use instagram or X, only use facebook for messenger with older family, and i avoid tiktok like the plague.

Well... With the seed planted, lets fast forward to tonight. I'm in bed next to my wife and while glancing over at my phone, a notification pops up. ""You have 1 new follower"". Its probably a bot, i swipe away the banner, but my wife gets curious. She wants to know who followed me. I say its probably a bot or nobody, who cares. She then gives me look and says aloud that she thinks I'm being dismissive too quickly. She has a lot of axieity and gets suspecious.

So she insists on looking and i relent. She opens the app and looks at the notifications. Its a nobody. But she then decides to have a look at the home page feed. One scroll down and she sees a Jessica Nigri cosplay post.

All hell breaks loose.

She immediately explodes and accuses me of cheating on her by looking near-naked cosplay models online. In her anger, she starts looking for more. Into my followers list. I'm a bit flustered because I had forgotten about who I followed on threads and can't answer when she screams at me asking why I follow 'naked' girls online. She find another ex-Rooster Teeth employee who posts cosplay pics. 

Now she explodes a second time and she thinks i'm a serial cheater, screaming i'm a dirty liar and a pervert.

It's a full on meltdown and no matter what I say, it doesn't get through. The way she expresses what she thinks at the moment makes it sound like I am actively going online to look up these women and self-pleasure myself to them. (A complete fabrication in her own mind). She claims that I must not love her and that she not enough to satisfy my 'needs', which is also not true at all. I love her. With my whole heart. It's killing me how upset she is.

I try to explain to her that everything she is saying is not true and that I love her. Nothing gets through. 

Now i'm locked out of the bedroom. I can hear her crying and it breaks my heart. I'm afraid she might hurt herself, as she has gotten dangerously close to it in the past. Depression during covid-lockdowns hit her very hard. My axieity levels are through the roof right now.

&lt;p&gt;All because of fucking Threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Way way back last year, when Threads launched, I checked it out. Used it for a couple days. Did a post, followed some accounts, and then proceeded to ingore it ever-after. Here is where the fuck up was planted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst the brand new (at the time) Thread accounts I was following, I followed a bunch of content creators associated with Rooster Teeth. This included all the big names; Gavin, Geoff, Jack, Blaine etc.... and some of their partners that show up in content and voice actor/actresses on their shows. This is was the fuck up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed some ladies, such as Meg Turney, Jessica Nigri, and Lindsay Jones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know they cosplay, but I&amp;#39;m not a big fan of that side of theor content. I recognise they do it well and move on if I ever see it, which is rare nowadays as I use social media very little. Never use instagram or X, only use facebook for messenger with older family, and i avoid tiktok like the plague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well... With the seed planted, lets fast forward to tonight. I&amp;#39;m in bed next to my wife and while glancing over at my phone, a notification pops up. &amp;quot;You have 1 new follower&amp;quot;. Its probably a bot, i swipe away the banner, but my wife gets curious. She wants to know who followed me. I say its probably a bot or nobody, who cares. She then gives me look and says aloud that she thinks I&amp;#39;m being dismissive too quickly. She has a lot of axieity and gets suspecious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So she insists on looking and i relent. She opens the app and looks at the notifications. Its a nobody. But she then decides to have a look at the home page feed. One scroll down and she sees a Jessica Nigri cosplay post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All hell breaks loose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She immediately explodes and accuses me of cheating on her by looking near-naked cosplay models online. In her anger, she starts looking for more. Into my followers list. I&amp;#39;m a bit flustered because I had forgotten about who I followed on threads and can&amp;#39;t answer when she screams at me asking why I follow &amp;#39;naked&amp;#39; girls online. She find another ex-Rooster Teeth employee who posts cosplay pics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now she explodes a second time and she thinks i&amp;#39;m a serial cheater, screaming i&amp;#39;m a dirty liar and a pervert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a full on meltdown and no matter what I say, it doesn&amp;#39;t get through. The way she expresses what she thinks at the moment makes it sound like I am actively going online to look up these women and self-pleasure myself to them. (A complete fabrication in her own mind). She claims that I must not love her and that she not enough to satisfy my &amp;#39;needs&amp;#39;, which is also not true at all. I love her. With my whole heart. It&amp;#39;s killing me how upset she is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to explain to her that everything she is saying is not true and that I love her. Nothing gets through. &lt;/p&gt;

And I failed. In my defense we had just woken up and I was still a little sleepy. But I turn my dumb, DUMB head towards her and say probably the single worst thing I could have said.
*“No. How would that even work.”*
Cue the utter look of disappointment. I’m talking big, puppy eyes. Shoving her lower lip forwards. Pushing up her nose slightly. I pretty much got the whole “you fucked up” package delivered to my face. 
She says “you could keep me in a little jar with dirt and leaves” and this is the moment a smart boyfriend realizes that this question has nothing to do with logic but instead is more of a “would you love me no matter what” question with a cute and funny twist.
And like the moron that I am I **double down and say the second worst thing I could have said**
*”But how do I like- love you? I can’t really like kiss you anymore or talk to you really.”*

Boys. Gals. Everything in between and off the spectrum. If your partner asks you if you’d still love them if they were a worm, just say yes. The look of “well I’m upset now” doesn’t make the victory in that discussion worth it. In my head I thought the two of us were on even terms there. In her head- I simply should have said yes and moved on. 
Luckily I quickly defused the situation by looking up how to hold worms as pets. One of the tips was that “worms need to wiggle” so I wrapped her in a blanket and shook her a little while making a dumb noise. That made her so happy and giddy that all was right in the world again but she did immediately tell her best friend who slid into my DMs to call me a dumbass and ask why I didn’t just say yes. She has reminded me several times of what I have said already and I get the feeling that she will not let me live this down anymore. Luckily she’s very easily distracted and I get her giggly with the “worms need to wiggle” but even as I’m typing this I’m wondering what in the world I was thinking. 

TL;DR Igot asked if I would still love my girlfriend if she was a worm and said no. Don’t do that.

,tifu,"This happened in the past two Thursdays.

I work from home as a technical writer and use Word for everything. I'm supposed to learn new software, called ""Confusion"" for this story. Confusion is a really complex hard to learn software with a thousand buttons, commands, and hundreds of features I'll never touch. Training was scheduled for 8:00 a.m Thursday on Teams with a few other writers in the company who were learning it too.

My day normally starts at 830. Two Thursdays ago I forgot about the start time and logged in at 830 only to discover training had started already. Immediately I was lost. Then my laptop wouldn't connect to the servers, so I couldn't even use the Confusion software. So the instructor said to follow along and the issues would be corrected the next day.

After staring at this ""training seminar"" for a while, completely lost, i started to do my regular work since I'm facing deadlines, and tuned out the seminar. Mercifully it ended at noon.

The next day the connection issues were fixed so I could train.

The next Thursday I was ready at 8:00, but my laptop wasn't. It took over ten minutes for my laptop to boot up, so by the time I was ready, they were already training. Immediately I was lost. My software worked, but I had no idea what was going on.

After staring at the screen for a million minutes, I wondered how I would learn Confusion since this training seminar was a huge waste of my time. I started looking online for tutorials but couldn't find one.

 Then I noticed the instructor kept referring to a pdf with instructions on it. I wondered where to get that pdf since it was something I evidently needed. So I hunted through my emails and found a link to documentation for the training seminar.  And THERE was the mystery pdf along  with other critical documents I didn't know about.

Now ignoring the seminar, I started reading the pdf and found step by step instructions on how to do each thing the instructor had been demonstrating. 

I spent the rest of the time on Step 1 trying to learn the software myself. After working with it for a while, I started understanding the basics. 

The other students were pretty much done and asking questions and sharing their screens with the instructor and asking for clarification. Meanwhile I was still diddling around with the first steps. No way I was sharing my screen or progress since I didn't want them to know what a complete dumbass I was the whole time. I never even turned on my camera or mic.

Everything would have been explained in that first Thursday morning that I missed. I would have known about the pdf and training materials. I could have learned Confusion in the traing seminars, but didn't. Now I'm behind and have to learn it myself 'cause I'm a dumbass.

,tifu,"TW: Suicide

A few days ago I was pretty drunk and I called a childhood friend to reconnect with, we’re in our mid 20s, he lives with family

As we were talking his mom came to talk to him, he had mentioned he was talking to me and she asked if he had told me yet, he said no and she said “oh -lucogamer- you know -friends sisters-, well her fiance just killed himself” and without hesitation or thinking I blurted out “she wasn’t that bad, was she” 

I don’t know what possessed me to say that and the worst part is the awkward sad hah I got from his mom, followed by “yeah she’s devastated, they just bought their first home together and he came out as trans, she ultimately left him because she didn’t want to be with a women, his family didn’t approve so he killed himself” 

The alcohol masked the realisation of what my joke was until I was recalling the events to my wife later on and once the words came from my mouth in the retelling and horror on my wife’s face I realised how awful my joke was 

Anyways I rarely ever drink, I’m a huge lightweight and this just shows that it’s probably for the best I keep my alcohol limited and my jokes to myself

TLDR : me drinking makes me not respond well to bad news

Edit:  I appreciate the laughs at my stupidity!

,tifu,"So I bought a house about a year ago and everything was going pretty good. I recently started working on getting a fence put up so I can start working on creating the perfect backyard garden. I got a couple of quotes and found a fencer that was reasonable and seemed to have a good record. 
 They wanted 2000$ up front and the remainder of the 3000$ in payments or full upon completion. Now this house is a fixer upper, it's the only way I got a house, so I got a lot of my money invested in other projects. I made payment arrangements for the down payment and made all, but one payment to them. When I gave the previous payment to them I mentioned being happy about being so close to getting the project started finally. The guy I was talking to said, 'what do you mean this is the first payment we received?' 
   I went inside where I had a list of the payments on the intial agreement and the signinature of the person I paid. He looked at me and goes, 'that man doesn't work for us. Do you have receipts from us?' 
   I then was handed a company marked receipt out of the book he had in his had. I gave that guy 1000$ and he never mentioned he didn't work there or a receipt. He drove a label van and a embroidered t-shirt and bag and answered the company phone number that the same guy I was talking to did. 
  The guy I was with looked at me and said, 'always ask for a receipt.' Like I didn't get the guy to sign the sheet I did every time. I took my money back, but I'm still out the 1000$. I talked to a lawyer and he did some research on it and filled a lawsuit against him, but since I gave cash payments to him I had no prove of exchange minus the 'fraudulent invoice' I 'forged' his signature on.

,tifu,"So this happened at school one day at lunchtime. I saw some of my friends playing handball, and thought it would be funny if I walked into the middle of their game, took a drink from my water bottle, and then walked off as if nothing had happened. In hindsight this was a horrible idea I know but at the time it seemed so funny that I wasn't thinking of the consequences.

So you could probably guess what happened next: I walked into their square, got my water bottle, and casually poured some water in my mouth as if my friends didn't exist. That's when I realised my FU: I couldn't stop myself from laughing and I still had a mouthful of water. I ended up spitting out most of the water but some of it came out of my nose. I was coughing so bad my friends looked at me like I was dying.

Fast forward to last week: I haven't seen these particular friends for a while and saw them again that day. Talked for a while, then they got up and started playing handball. Now I don't know what I was thinking, but I decided to do the same joke again. Yep, the joke which ended up with me choking on water. I suppose I thought that I would be able to control my laughter this time. Spoilers, I couldn't and the exact same thing happened again: water coming out of my nose, uncontrollable coughing.

,tifu,"A few years ago, I agreed to meet up an OfferUp seller to buy a bicycle for $200. there were multiple red flags that I consciously acknowledged but chose to ignore.

The seller already had the bicycle posted for a decent price but I figured why not shoot an offer and try to get a better deal, worst they could say was no, or so I thought. the seller agreed to the offer and we scheduled to meet a few hours later that day. 

the city of the meet up location was the first red flag. definitely not the safest city and I would see a reason why. but I proceed to head over to the park for the meet. as soon as I get off the freeway, I notice that this area does not look like the best part of this already unsafe city. I continue on. 

I pull up to the park and see multiple families and think this shouldn't be too bad, there's several people around so I message the seller and he tells me to meet him near the bathrooms at the back end of the parking lot. okay, on my way!

I move my car to the designated, much more secluded meeting area where I see three guys, probably in their mid to late teens, with the bike I'm there to buy. oooo I want it. 

I attempt to greet the three fine young gentlemen holding onto my soon to be ride but there was no response so I ask if I could check out the bike to which one of them actually speaks and says yes. 

after a quick look over, I tell the non-mute young buck that I'll take the bike and give him the cash. instead of letting go of the bike and handing it over to me, the one holding the bike says he'll help me load it in my car. sure, I'm right over here. 

as we start walking the 15 feet to my car, the three youngsters turn in the wrong direction. I try to say hey my cars right here but they keep walking so I say hey where yall goin?? 

the response was definitely not what I anticipated but looking back, I know I put myself in the situation. 

one of these bad boys turns around and lifts his shirt just enough to reveal the handle of a handgun in his waistband. definitely not worth it and i was not going to FAFO if it was actually real or not. I immediately stop and watch as they duck through a hole in the chain link fence and down into the wash with my bike and my $200.

I call my girlfriend, fuming and tell her what happened. she asks if I had called the cops. that's probably a good idea....

given the unsavory nature of this city and the mention of a gun or maybe it was a slow day, the local police showed up within 10 minutes and I see/hear a helicopter overhead. I tell them my story and they say that criminals in the area prey on folks from out of town, although I graduated college in the same city so I was familiar lol. the officer gives me a police report number and tells me a detective would be in contact. never heard anything after that day. the officer also suggested meeting at a bank where there are cameras or at the police station. they have designated rooms to conduct that type of business. also preferably do not go alone.

,tifu,"A friend got me to reinstall and play GTA V Online again a few weeks ago, since he bought a new copy for himself since it was fully compatible with his Steam Deck (a hand held pc that uses Linux instead of windows).  He had previously had it on Playstation.

We played for the past few weeks.  Well about a week ago, after we are done heisting, I shoot him in game.  The game had put a bounty on him for leaving my motorcycle club.  I also hunt down our other friend who was with him, for the lolz.  I expect the other friend to retaliate, so I put down proximity mines behind me as I go hide in the mineshaft.  What I did not know is that there are cryptids (big foot) hidden in game, and that he was looking for one.  Going in the mineshaft to find the cryptid, he runs into the proximity mine and gets killed.  He gets angry and quits the game for a few days.

I feel like an Asshat, so while I wait for him to return to the game, I do the setup missions (which are mostly annoying) for all the heists, even completing some of those heists to reset them in hopes for more/better loot, and doing the setup.  So I have 4 heists ready to rock, giving him all the fun without the frustration.

2 days ago, Rockstar implements a new anticheat, which doesn't even work.  More importantly, it prevents anyone with a steam deck from playing GTA Online, meaning I can never make it up to my friend in game, nor can I play with him on that game.

,tifu,"So recently, I had a runny nose which was lasting for a while and not going away. My parents recommended I boil water and try to take the steam from it as it should clear my nose. It made sense to me. 

I boiled water in a kettle and poured it into this mini pot, put it on a table and put my face over it. The issue was the steam wasn’t really going in my nose directly so I decided to put a towel over my head to cover the flow of steam, which means the towel was covering the mini pot. At this point, I am sitting on a chair with my head over the pot and a towel over my head. 

It was working fine. The steam was clearing my nose. Then all of a sudden, someone called my name and I looked up. As I looked up, the towel got caught under the handle of the pan and it spilled all over my legs, and stomach. 

It was scorching hot and I started screaming while jumping up rushing to take my clothes off. I literally took everything off in the kitchen and told everyone to not come there as I was butt naked in my kitchen with burns all over my legs, lower stomach and private parts. 

I tried to put aloe Vera gel and some other shit over it but it kills. Might go to the hospital idk.

,tifu,"This happened today, I was cooking Indian Food, lot of heat in the kitchen. My mom kept aside a pressure cooker in which she made rice and I didn’t pay attention to it. The pressure cooker was kept near the ingredients I had to use. 

So in an attempt to quickly do the cooking, while reaching out for the ingredients, I picked up the pressure cooker not by its handle but like how one picks up a jar. I obviously forgot that it had freshly steamed rice in it. 

guess what happened next? Yes, it was too late by then. I let out a loud scream and dropped the hot pressure cooker on the ground. Its lid broke and all the rice cooked for lunch got spilled. 

I belong to an Asian household, so what happened next was not pleasant. Mother shouted at me because she didn’t realise I had burned my hand. Even I forgot the pain for a few minutes. But after that scolding, when the temperatures in the kitchen calmed down, my hand started to burn. I have a patch of burnt skin now.

,tifu,"TIFU. I cheated (maybe) on my girlfriend who lives in the same building with me. 

I met this girl in late December last year right around Christmas. Nothing happened between us, although we were hanging out occasionally on the terrace and having coffee. In February, we made out once after a party, and again nothing happened, we distanced for a while and then stayed as friends. Late march, early April, we kind of started seeing each other no definitions, very casual scene, soon after I fell sick , and she had a trip to Thailand so we were apart for two weeks or so, when I came back , I fell sick again and went home for 1.5 months, we were basically doing long distance in a casual scene. When I came back, we did have conversations about who we are and where this is going(more on this later). During this time, my ex girlfriend texted me and I sexted with her(not exact sexting but flirting with the idea, we previously have slept after the breakup as well, she texts me every month or two). I talked to her a 3-4 times once in may, once in July, twice in august but never slept with her. When I came back from home, we had this conversation about where this is going and she said she is not ready to call it a relationship yet, at this point, I realised I didn't want to do a relationship anymore either, and in my mind had decided that I will end things with her. but didn't do it then, because she was again going on a trip and I didn't want to ruin her trip. Two days before the trip, she asked me whether I want to call it a relationship , I Was unsure but still said yes. Two days later, she went to the Vietnam, I came back to my home. During the trip, we had a lot of fights, and I was getting sure that I will breakup with her, when she comes back. A day before coming back, I texted this girl from my past who I really liked at one point, congratulations ( she became a doctor) and we got to talking. Next day she asked to see me if I haven't  left?, we met for 15 minutes in the hospital she was working at. when I came back, I was talking to her, but my girlfriend and I were fighting and I didn't want to talk to her anyway. She came back on 3rd sep, I went to the airport, picked her up and couple of hours later, we again had a fight and broke up. We didn't talk for two days, and 3rd day I went back to her room just so we could end things on a good note, but out of guilt, I said let's try again, and that thing got prolonged for 12 days, one day, I was taking a shower, and she saw the chats with my ex girlfriend, I hadn't talked to her for a while since I didn't want to sleep with her. After this, again out of guilt, I said give me a chance, two days later she agreed, and immediately within minutes I told her about the Girl from my past. We started fighting again, I kept saying that give me a chance just out of guilt. I started having anxiety attacks as well, ( I have been depressed for 5 years or so). She helped me with it and so did I,( she also has same issues, and she has done self harm as well). We were spending time with each other to help each other, but due to guilt I was constantly giving her the option to get back. She said that until I leave the building(I have been considering this) , we can stay in touch, stay normal I decided I don't want this and have been staying away from her for the past 2 days. now I don't know what to do. Did I cheat on her? Should I get back to her just because of guilt and since I never wanted to hurt her? What should I do?

A day before coming back, I texted this girl from my past who I really liked at one point, congratulations ( she became a doctor) and we got to talking. Next day she asked to see me if I haven&amp;#39;t  left?, we met for 15 minutes in the hospital she was working at. when I came back, I was talking to her, but my girlfriend and I were fighting and I didn&amp;#39;t want to talk to her anyway. She came back on 3rd sep, I went to the airport, picked her up and couple of hours later, we again had a fight and broke up. We didn&amp;#39;t talk for two days, and 3rd day I went back to her room just so we could end things on a good note, but out of guilt, I said let&amp;#39;s try again, and that thing got prolonged for 12 days, one day, I was taking a shower, and she saw the chats with my ex girlfriend, I hadn&amp;#39;t talked to her for a while since I didn&amp;#39;t want to sleep with her. After this, again out of guilt, I said give me a chance, two days later she agreed, and immediately within minutes I told her about the Girl from my past. We started fighting again, I kept saying that give me a chance just out of guilt. I started having anxiety attacks as well, ( I have been depressed for 5 years or so). She helped me with it and so did I,( she also has same issues, and she has done self harm as well). We were spending time with each other to help each other, but due to guilt I was constantly giving her the option to get back. She said that until I leave the building(I have been considering this) , we can stay in touch, stay normal I decided I don&amp;#39;t want this and have been staying away from her for the past 2 days. now I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. Did I cheat on her? Should I get back to her just because of guilt and since I never wanted to hurt her? What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL : DR
I FUCKED UP WITH THE GIRL LIVING IN MY BUILDING. &lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"Obligatory ""this actually happened over the course of months.""



So, I rent a house with two other people. One of them is 26M and has ADD, and is terribly scatter-brained. To the point where he struggled to keep a job. Something that really bothered me was that he'd often leave dirty dishes on the counter and just forget to do them. It would often be days before he'd notice or remember them. Sometimes I'd remind him and he'd say he'd do it but then forget again.

I knew that he wasn't doing it on purpose because he'd also forget things that inconvenienced him, e.g. cooking a large batch of food, leaving it to cool and then forgetting to put in the fridge later, wasting his time and money. I like to think I'm a considerate person, I started reminding him if I noticed it was getting late and his food was still out. I'd also put his milk back in the fridge or other things he'd forget about that could spoil.

I also started doing his dishes if he left them out for more than a day, because it really bothered me and I honestly prefer doing them to having the awkward conversation. If he noticed he would ask me if I did them, and then apologize for leaving them out and ask me to just tell him to do them instead. But I'd done that and he'd forget again, so I'd just be dealing with the awkwardness for nothing.



One day he asked me when I **hadn't** actually done the dishes, so I said no. He shrugged and said he must have just done them and forgotten that he had. The next time he asked, I was frustrated and a lightbulb went off in my head - I could say no and he'd probably assume he'd just forgotten doing them.

I said I hadn't, and it went exactly as I'd thought. I felt like a huge weight was off my shoulders, I could enjoy a cleaner home without having to play mommy to this guy.

From then on I always denied doing his dishes, sometimes other things too. One time he went on a three-week trip and I went in his room and took out the dirty dishes and emptied his trash to prevent pests, because we'd struggled with flies.

After a couple of months, he mentions to me that he's seeking a proper diagnosis and medical treatment for his ADD. In this country it's not particularly easy to get diagnosed and it costs a good amount money or a years-long waitlist. I encouraged him to do it because he clearly has problems. But then he admits to me that he's been particularly concerned because he's been forgetting things much more the last few months, particularly in terms of chores, and it's been disturbing him.

I felt terrible. I almost confessed, but I worried about the consequences and fallout. Instead I just tapered off doing the chores.

I feel conflicted because my intentions were good and my actions also had good consequences. He told his doctor about his distress and she got him bumped up the waitlist, now he's diagnosed and on Adderall. He seems to be doing a lot better in life, less forgetful, managing to hold down a job. But I still gaslighted him and caused him distress over a long period of time, so of course I feel guilty.

,tifu,"I don't even know where to begin with this, the title makes it sound so bad but I don't know how to word it better. I apologize for how long this post will probably be- I guess I'll just start with some context.

I (29M) and my wife Fiona (26F) have a stable, if somewhat generic, marriage. We have two kids (and a third that died). We have a solid friend group and a good family support system. Two notable members of this friend group are Garth (29M) and Cheri (24F). Garth is a friend I've had since high school and we still associate quite regularly. Cheri is Garth's wife, who I also met back when she was dating Garth, and we had similar interests and became quite close, quite quickly. 

At this point I am closer to Cheri than I am to Garth due to our similar interests. We've never crossed any serious boundaries except for on one occasion when we fell asleep together on their couch while watching a movie. Nothing happened, but things looked shady for a while. We're now back to normal as both Garth and Fiona have realized it was an honest accident and nothing inappropriate happened.

My wife is quite religious, while I'm more of a ""direct spiritual connection to God"" type of person. As such we are both happy to be members of a small church that has a small community of friendly people. They do yearly courses and sessions on various topics, and one of the ones that was organized for this year was a marriage-related one. Essentially, it focuses on how one's relationship with God will affect one's relationship with others. Fiona and I both agreed that it would be nice to join the group. I spoke to Cheri and tried to convince her and Garth to join the group, and while Cheri was interested, she is a bit cliquey and didn't like a few of the people in the group so she ultimately declined.

So the first session rolls around, and that self-same day one of our children is not doing so well. Fiona opts to stay home which means that I would be going to the marriage study by myself. The group chat for the session revealed that two men, of the ""more traditional"" members of the study, were also staying home that session, and those were the two guys that Cheri hadn't wanted to be around while talking about marriage. I messaged this change of plans to Cheri and asked if she and Garth want to show up now that these two guys are gone.

When I mentioned that Fiona is also staying at home, Cheri enthusiastically responded, ""How about I be your +1? Hahaha it would be so funny."" I did think it was funny but I asked about Garth, which Cheri replied that he had just got home from work and could babysit the kids while she went out. Cheri checked with Garth and he was fine with her going out with me to the course just as friends. So, cue the TIFU, I decided to pick up Cheri on my way to the marriage course and show up with a +1 instead of, well, my actual wife.

Well. It *was* funny. Cheri and I both laughed when she called herself my +1, and most of the other people in the group laughed as well. We explained the situation and everyone was mostly cool with it. During the session every so often when relationship topics came up, we would refer to our friendship as if it was a marriage that also had its issues and needed work, which was a regular source of comic relief for the group. Cheri also joked on our way back home that it was a good thing this particular session didn't have any discussions involving the bedroom or we would have looked very unconventional indeed. She also told me she was glad she came along with me. So it essentially went as expected.

What I did *not* expect was for one of the women in the group to call my wife the next day. I had made the mistake of not telling Fiona that I was taking Cheri as essentially a ""stand-in for my wife"" (as the woman who called Fiona put it). I came home from work to find Fiona very upset with me, asking why I hadn't at least told her I was taking Cheri there. I explained that I didn't think it was very important to brief her on every plan I make with my friends. Fiona replied that this was different because there's an implied level of intimacy to courses like this and I had now created a semblance of said intimacy with Cheri. I did my best to assure her that this wasn't the case, I simply like Cheri and was hoping that by coming along she'd be convinced to actually join the group (with Garth of course).

Fiona didn't seem convinced though, probably due to the last time the boundaries had been accidentally blurred with Cheri. She went through my phone and read my messages with Cheri, which I let her do because I had nothing to hide. The messages revealed to Fiona that Cheri was generally the one to initiate contact with me, and that I was clearly the ""better person"" in our conversations, and that we never spoke about anything overtly inappropriate, and that if any boundary pushing had been happening at all, it was from Cheri, not me.

So now my reputation in the local community may have shifted because we all know how church people like to gossip a bit, and also my wife is unhappy with how I handled the situation.

,tifu,"I bought a 80 x 32 inch door hoping it would fit in my 2023 Camry. I was skeptical but I went ahead and bought it and it fit perfectly with the seats folded down. So if anyone is wondering, you CAN fit a whole door in your Camry as long as you have short legs. I don’t, so my drive home was awkward and totally worth it. I got the door to replace my garage door so I could add a cat door. During all my excitement, I forgot to lock my car. (Live in the suburbs of Austin). 
Then my dumbass cut a hole in the top of the door instead of the bottom, so now I have a nice door with a properly installed cat door and a giant hole at the top :). icing on the cake…the one night I forget to lock my doors, someone rummaged through my car, took my credit card and approximately $60 cash, spent almost  $400 at Walmart on chocolate milk, makeup, men’s pants and shirts, 2 $105 gift cards, and I’m pretty sure they stole my AirPods. Kicker is I was in the garage around the time I think this happened, I stay up late…and while I was in there I swear I heard leaves crunching and voices outside, but thought maybe it was someone walking by talking on the phone at 1am?? Dumb..Probably a sign for me to check if my car was locked. PROBABLY the person in my car telling their friend they finally found someone dumb enough to leave their card door open. Hindsight is 20/20. I’ve always had an issue leaving my stuff in my car because I don’t carry a purse. Will definitely be working on that.  The worst part for me personally was I had two red tail hawk feathers I found over 7 years ago, I kept these in my console and they broke one in their rush to steal my things, maybe that’s silly, maybe I’m weird. What a great day! 

P.S. fu to the person who did that, I’ve tried all day to stop myself from setting up some kind of booby trap, but unfortunately they are all illegal :) I hope your chocolate milk is spoiled, and it spills all over the new pants you bought. I hope you went to another store, loaded up your cart and tried to check out and it got DECLINED. I’m sure that’s why you got the gift cards tho, so what’s better… hmm Idk any suggestions would be helpful for my mental state.

I was skeptical but I went ahead and bought it and it fit perfectly with the seats folded down. So if anyone is wondering, you CAN fit a whole door in your Camry as long as you have short legs. I don’t, so my drive home was awkward and totally worth it. I got the door to replace my garage door so I could add a cat door. During all my excitement, I forgot to lock my car. (Live in the suburbs of Austin). 
Then my dumbass cut a hole in the top of the door instead of the bottom, so now I have a nice door with a properly installed cat door and a giant hole at the top :). icing on the cake…the one night I forget to lock my doors, someone rummaged through my car, took my credit card and approximately $60 cash, spent almost  $400 at Walmart on chocolate milk, makeup, men’s pants and shirts, 2 $105 gift cards, and I’m pretty sure they stole my AirPods. Kicker is I was in the garage around the time I think this happened, I stay up late…and while I was in there I swear I heard leaves crunching and voices outside, but thought maybe it was someone walking by talking on the phone at 1am?? Dumb..Probably a sign for me to check if my car was locked. PROBABLY the person in my car telling their friend they finally found someone dumb enough to leave their card door open. Hindsight is 20/20. I’ve always had an issue leaving my stuff in my car because I don’t carry a purse. Will definitely be working on that.  The worst part for me personally was I had two red tail hawk feathers I found over 7 years ago, I kept these in my console and they broke one in their rush to steal my things, maybe that’s silly, maybe I’m weird. What a great day! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. fu to the person who did that, I’ve tried all day to stop myself from setting up some kind of booby trap, but unfortunately they are all illegal :) I hope your chocolate milk is spoiled, and it spills all over the new pants you bought. I hope you went to another store, loaded up your cart and tried to check out and it got DECLINED. I’m sure that’s why you got the gift cards tho, so what’s better… hmm Idk any suggestions would be helpful for my mental state. &lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"I ate my first meal super late today. I didn’t really make enough to fill me up and I don’t keep much for snacks around. I poked my head in the freezer and there sat my mostly uneaten tub of Chapmans espresso frozen yogurt. I thought to myself, “why not? I’m an adult. I can have some fro-yo if I want.”

I grabbed a spoon and sat at the table with my 2L tub of delicious frozen dessert. I scrolled Reddit while carefully spooning small bits into my mouth because I have sensitive teeth. I stopped watching the time or how much I ate. Suddenly my guts rumbled. I can handle small amounts of dairy and the like but because I’ve had my gallbladder removed I don’t tolerate them very well in large portions. I looked at the tub. I’m pretty sure I cleared a full litre of the delectable “snack” while doomscrolling through garbage. 

The explosion was imminent. I popped the lid back on and threw it into the freezer while hobbling my way to the bathroom like some kind of sideshow freak. Now you might be saying “oh no, Larry-Man, this isn’t a huge TIFU and shit happens” but I haven’t gotten to the worst part yet.

As I sit here typing this atop my porcelain throne, I am dying from stomach cramps while only 3 weeks post-op from my hysterectomy. I am basically trying not to cramp up so bad I damage things internally and I’m terrified my vagina is gonna turn inside out. I’m sweating buckets. And to make matters even more horrifying - the toilet roll is empty. And it’s my fault. I was going to bring some fresh rolls into the bathroom after lunch. But in my haste to drop the kids off at the pool I forgot to bring it with me.

So while I’m technically an adult I have been left unsupervised. I’m at home alone and wondering if I can make it upstairs to the cleaning supplies closet to get toilet paper without leaving a trail of fecal destruction in my wake.

And it’s so bad that I don’t even want to go into the shower without a pre-emptive wipe or 6. I’m sure it’s how this is gonna go but I’m not happy about it.

For 5 days over it and my parents are livid. I genuinely don’t know what to do since she knew it was meant to be private but then again is said it was ok. I’m stressing tf out rn and I’m just lost. 

This will most likely fuck up my school record and I was just about to start applying for colleges. Hoco is canceled, plus I can’t match for the band anymore and I’m a primary leader for a section.

For context, i'm a Venezuelan-American. I was born in the US but i was actually raised in Venezuela for about the first 10 years of my life, this mainly consisted of visiting the family over the summer vacation (although i did spend one full year there when i was three, in fact my earliest memory ever is of my uncle tricking me into drinking beer at age 3 in a town called El Tigre). Obviously because of this upbringing i grew up fluent in both English and Spanish. The thing about Spanish though is that when you learn it, you're learning it, you're learning a specific version of it. English has it's regional differences too but at least in my experience it's not as big. Though the Spanish i speak is Venezuelan, growing up i at least knew that Colombians call beans ""frijoles"" instead of ""caraotas"" and that Spaniards use the ""vos"" prefix. Once i became an adult though, i came into much more contact with various different versions of Spanish.

From confusing my coworkers by asking for a ""pitillo"" (straw in Venezuela, cigarette in Puerto Rico), getting confused when an Ecuadorean (i think) came into the store looking for a ""buso"" (jacket). But all of these usually result in a good laugh and we move on. Except for one time where i think the guy i accidentally offended was gonna take a swing at me. In the store i work at, we do offer free tailoring with purchase. This Salvadorian man came in looking for a suit and so we go to take his measurements.

Thankfully it was resolved and he was able to get his suit.

When i got home, i went online and searched if there were other meanings of the word. See, in Venezuela, as you have read, chola is slang for sandals. Yeah we say ""sandalia"" too but more often than not we're saying chola (unless they're from Maracaibo, that's the Quebec of Venezuela). As it turns out though, in several Central American countries, of which include El Salvador, chola/o is an indigenous slur. Well. That's the day i learned something. That said aside from being more careful, i'm not really sure what i'm supposed to do about it because that's not what it means where i'm from.

&lt;p&gt;Fasst forward to 10 minutes ago and I realised I left my AirPods case on the bus. I’ve done nearly done this a few times but every time before someone has noticed and let me know, but not today. So I basically just got robbed of like $300. I’ve just had the worst day and this just made it 10x worse &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tldr: I had a shit day and shouldn’t have left my house this morning &lt;/p&gt;

It’s possible I was overreacting in the original post. But I think I could have been in real danger. If I made it awkward, it would have been awkward. If I had come in with my tail between my legs. If I tried to ask for their forgiveness, rehashing the whole conversation over and over. Knowing myself, I would have probably let it distract me from doing a good job, which would have made the whole thing way worse and cemented me as the office fuckup.

Instead my attitude was, I’m here to do my job and be great at it, yes I said what I said and yes it was awkward, but let’s move forward. Thinking about it now, I wonder if my initial catastropizing reaction to the meeting was based purely out of fear for their over-aggressive reaction to what I said, rather than actual regret for what I said.

I’m glad I decided to listen to all the folks in the comments who said “no one will remember, and you may even laugh about this one day.” All of your kind and thoughtful words helped me navigate this situation.

Talked shit about the previous people to hold this job. Accused people of not doing their job. Talked about rumors that were spreading within the company as though I believed them, rumors which were easily disproven. Complained about people not liking me.

,tifu,"First of all I want to clarify, I don’t have any hate or prejudice against handicapped or special needs people, I better don’t, since I’m married to one, my wife had a traffic accident a few years ago, shes not wheelchair bound, but she sometimes needs a cane to get around.

Now, to the story, I’ve been a little sick in the stomach for a couple of days, (it starts with D and ends with rrhea) so I didn’t want to get out of the house, but my wife really needed to buy some things and really hates going out by herself so she convinced me to go along with her.

We were in a Wal-mart type store and suddenly, as expected, I felt the urgent need to go to the restroom, I hurry over.

As in many places, the last restroom stall is way bigger than the rest, and while there aren’t any signs to indicate it, it is understood that they are meant for handicapped people so they can maneuver as needed, I usually refuse to use them, but boy was this an emergency!

All the other stalls were taken, I tried holding it and waiting, but they sure were taking their sweet time, so I ended up using the last stall, thinking “what are the odds that someone who really needs it will come right now?”

Lo and behold, shortly after sitting down, I hear a loud bang on the door, I look and can clearly see the wheel under the stall door, and the guy starts loudly yelling “come out! I need to use it! You’re not supposed to be there!”

I should have come out immediately but, you know those people who can’t stop once they get going? Im one of them. I did my thing as fast as possible, but still took me 3 or 4 minutes.

I opened the stall door and there he was: an elderly man (probably 60-65) on a wheelchair, he rolled right in, but not before throwing me a hateful look, I look around and everyone was looking at me, (like four guys among the ones waiting and the ones washing hands, but still) I felt really embarrassed.

,tifu,"Hello Everyone. 

I am not sure how updating works, but after the many responses I received yesterday I just wanted to keep you all in the loop of the situation. I asked the Mods if I was allowed to post an update and they agreed (Thank you Mods)

If you don't know me &gt;[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1fi1dmw/tifu_by_turning_my_daughter_into_a_wannabe/) &lt; is my post from yesterday - 

Firstly, please can I thank everyone in the comments showing support and sharing your own stories. Thank you. 

I honestly thought, and still do to some extent, that I have f'ed up and failed my daughter. I thought her need to protect came from the fact she had seen me so broken. A comment which I have now lost said something along the lines of ""mummy got hurt by bad people, and now her friend is being threatened, so she wanted to stand up for us"". As honourable as that is, I don't want my little girl to feel that way. I want her to be a child for as long as she can be. I want her to play with her friends and have no cares in the world apart from who's going to be the goalkeeper or if she wants ham or turkey on a sandwich, do you know what I mean? 

I have spent some time with her over the weekend and last night reassuring her of that fact. I am always in her corner, I am always right behind her, and I will always believe her, no matter what. She has promised me going forward that she will always tell me, from the small things to the big things. I'm her Mum, no matter her age, she is always going to be my baby and I am always going to go to bat for her.  

We have also discussed if she feels safe in the school and if she feels the teachers would have dealt with it if she had told them - she said she feels safe, but she doesn't know if they would do anything, but she has never asked. This is something I will be keeping an eye on and discussing with other parents if their children have similar feelings.

So, on to the update - My daughter is suspended until Wednesday. I had a meeting with the deputy headmaster, because the headmaster is ""unavailable"" today. 

Alex's mum, who for ease I am going to call Joanne, had a meeting with him yesterday afternoon. For context, my meeting with him was about 20 min long. Joanne kept him locked in the office with her for nearly 2 hours. In those 2 hours, she made him go through chapter and verse the ""anti-bullying"" policy and explain each point to her. 

Joanne told me she had him admit that what the other child said to Alex alone should have been grounds for punishment. He still claims he had not been told about the threats and wants to open an investigation into his staff to ""get to the bottom of it"". Joanne told him she didn't care right now how he handled his staff, he needs to stop trying to place blame elsewhere, and take accountability. She told him, her first and only concern right now was that her child had been at the school less than a week and had received a threat of death twice, and the only person being punished is the only person who stood up for him. He reiterated that ""we have a zero tolerance policy"" to which Joanne stopped him mid sentence and asked him why her son wasn't included in that policy? He APOLOGISED and said ""I can see how that could look that way"", however he has not said how he would be fixing it because he has to do another ""investigation""... I am starting to think he has a word of the day calendar or something. 

My meeting with the deputy head was very basic, I think it was essentially just to placate me, but I have everything documented if I need to go through this again. My daughter has been suspended for fighting, she can return to school tomorrow morning. I did ask if the other child will be punished, but was told they can't discuss the other child and TBH that is fair, but I will be monitoring the situation. There will be no behaviour report or forced apology.

Last night, we went to Alex's house and had dinner. Alex keeps telling my daughter ""you're on my Christmas card list for life"". I don't know where he got it from, but they think its hilarious. 

My daughter has convinced Alex to try karate, they are very excited. Its karate night for us on Thursday, I will be talking with Sensei Paul about the altercation. Just so they can have a chat about safety, when to fight etc, more than anything else I just want her to be safe. She isn't an army, she is still a little person and she needs to remember that sometimes. 

I also told my daughter I told her story to some people on line, and I showed her some of the nicer comments. I asked her if she would like to choose a name you can call her, she has chosen Hawk... suddenly something clicked into place. The flying punch she did, it was a ""cobra punch"", the character Hawk (Cobra Kai) does them a lot, you sort of kick your leg like you're going to kick the opponent but instead move with a punch... NO ONE has taught her this move, but I have seen her jump off the settee and sort of do it before. When we started doing karate, I took that as an opportunity to introduce her to the the Karate Kid series, and obviously following that we started Cobra Kai. She is absolutly obsessed with Hawk and Tori (Minor spoiler for Cobra Kai &gt;!please don't talk to her about the end of the last season, she is very upset with Tori right now!&lt;) So we have now had another discussion about how we shouldn't replicate things we see in TV and Movies. Parenting is hard... and I have the teen years to come yet. I might just dye my hair grey now and get it over with.

One more thing I would like to address. I had two really horrid DM's regarding Alex's gender identity and sexual orientation - FIRSTLY, they are 9. He is figuring out who he is. If they are LGBTQ+, then that's who they are, but its no one's place but Alex's to determine that. He likes bright colours, he likes how make-up and nail polish makes people look, he is just unapologetically HIMSELF, and we can all learn a thing or two about that.

Oh, another thing. I never understood why people felt the need to justify themselves to the people in the comments claiming their stories were AI generated, but now experiencing it, it kinda stings a little. I am not writing this for validation, I don't know enough to care about whatever Karma Points are and I wouldn't know how to use Chat GPT if my life depended on it. I can't prove to you I am human, and this is real, nor does it really matter. But please be careful who you say that to, someone could be out here pouring their heart out and you completely diminish that by diminishing them. Just be kind to people, or don't say anything at all. You know what they say, opinions are like arseholes, everybody has one and they all stink. 

Anyways. ""Hawk"" saw some of the comments saying she deserves a treat, a lot of you were saying ice-cream... she doesn't want that. **She wants a sword**. Apart from being terrifying sometimes, I think she is going to be OK. I am going to buy her &gt; [this ](https://www.southernswords.co.uk/wood-grain-detailed-samurai-wakazashi-training-sword.html)&lt; training sword, and I think maybe some books about the Samurai. If anyone has any other suggestions, I am all ears!! I don't know if they will be a good or bad role model, but she seems like she has developed a passion for martial arts, and I am all about supporting physical activities, but getting some history in there would be amazing too. 

I'm sorry, I intended to keep this brief, but I just seem to waffle. I think I need to find more adults to talk to haha. I was never much into journaling growing up, but I can see why people do it, its nice to just get everything in your head out of there and in black and white. Things can seem a lot more simple when they are on the page. 

Anyway - I am not sure what the future holds, but I know we will tackle it head on, sword in hand apparently. 

Thank you for the love, I really needed it. You are all great people.

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure how updating works, but after the many responses I received yesterday I just wanted to keep you all in the loop of the situation. I asked the Mods if I was allowed to post an update and they agreed (Thank you Mods)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t know me &amp;gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1fi1dmw/tifu_by_turning_my_daughter_into_a_wannabe/""&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt; is my post from yesterday - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, please can I thank everyone in the comments showing support and sharing your own stories. Thank you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly thought, and still do to some extent, that I have f&amp;#39;ed up and failed my daughter. I thought her need to protect came from the fact she had seen me so broken. A comment which I have now lost said something along the lines of &amp;quot;mummy got hurt by bad people, and now her friend is being threatened, so she wanted to stand up for us&amp;quot;. As honourable as that is, I don&amp;#39;t want my little girl to feel that way. I want her to be a child for as long as she can be. I want her to play with her friends and have no cares in the world apart from who&amp;#39;s going to be the goalkeeper or if she wants ham or turkey on a sandwich, do you know what I mean? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spent some time with her over the weekend and last night reassuring her of that fact. I am always in her corner, I am always right behind her, and I will always believe her, no matter what. She has promised me going forward that she will always tell me, from the small things to the big things. I&amp;#39;m her Mum, no matter her age, she is always going to be my baby and I am always going to go to bat for her.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also discussed if she feels safe in the school and if she feels the teachers would have dealt with it if she had told them - she said she feels safe, but she doesn&amp;#39;t know if they would do anything, but she has never asked. This is something I will be keeping an eye on and discussing with other parents if their children have similar feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, on to the update - My daughter is suspended until Wednesday. I had a meeting with the deputy headmaster, because the headmaster is &amp;quot;unavailable&amp;quot; today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex&amp;#39;s mum, who for ease I am going to call Joanne, had a meeting with him yesterday afternoon. For context, my meeting with him was about 20 min long. Joanne kept him locked in the office with her for nearly 2 hours. In those 2 hours, she made him go through chapter and verse the &amp;quot;anti-bullying&amp;quot; policy and explain each point to her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joanne told me she had him admit that what the other child said to Alex alone should have been grounds for punishment. He still claims he had not been told about the threats and wants to open an investigation into his staff to &amp;quot;get to the bottom of it&amp;quot;. Joanne told him she didn&amp;#39;t care right now how he handled his staff, he needs to stop trying to place blame elsewhere, and take accountability. She told him, her first and only concern right now was that her child had been at the school less than a week and had received a threat of death twice, and the only person being punished is the only person who stood up for him. He reiterated that &amp;quot;we have a zero tolerance policy&amp;quot; to which Joanne stopped him mid sentence and asked him why her son wasn&amp;#39;t included in that policy? He APOLOGISED and said &amp;quot;I can see how that could look that way&amp;quot;, however he has not said how he would be fixing it because he has to do another &amp;quot;investigation&amp;quot;... I am starting to think he has a word of the day calendar or something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My meeting with the deputy head was very basic, I think it was essentially just to placate me, but I have everything documented if I need to go through this again. My daughter has been suspended for fighting, she can return to school tomorrow morning. I did ask if the other child will be punished, but was told they can&amp;#39;t discuss the other child and TBH that is fair, but I will be monitoring the situation. There will be no behaviour report or forced apology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, we went to Alex&amp;#39;s house and had dinner. Alex keeps telling my daughter &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re on my Christmas card list for life&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t know where he got it from, but they think its hilarious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter has convinced Alex to try karate, they are very excited. Its karate night for us on Thursday, I will be talking with Sensei Paul about the altercation. Just so they can have a chat about safety, when to fight etc, more than anything else I just want her to be safe.

,tifu,"TIFU by taking the wrong med!

This just happened.

So, my Dad died a few months ago, he was on a lot of medication, some prescription, some not.  The non prescription stuff was mostly kept (prescription meds returned to pharmacy for proper disposal) as it was stuff that will get used (painkillers, antihistamines etc).  

I’ve had a headache coming on for the past hour, so I went to the cupboard, got out a box labelled ‘paracetamol’, and took out two white tablets - thought the shape was odd, but what the hell, it’s not a brand I’ve used before, and it says “paracetamol” on the box - should be fine, right?

As I replaced them in the box I glanced at the back of the foil on the back of the blister pack, and got a warning from my lizard brain that something was wrong - looking closer I saw the words “sildenafil 50mg”.  Panicked, I googled Sildenafil to find out what the hell I just took, and if I need to go to hospital. Imagine my combined relief and concern upon discovering that Sildenafil is generic viagra. Fuck. I’ve just taken 100mg of generic viagra. My partner is 200 miles away. I’m in for a hard night 😳😳😳

Also found out that my parents were on the job far later in life than I thought (Dad was 88 when he died).

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m super embarrassed and idk what to do, like do I apologise or just pretend it didn&amp;#39;t happen? They are pretty chill people but like still I feel so bad even though everyone else was laughing, tf do I do &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: got far too drunk and threw up at a friend&amp;#39;s house, what do I do ? &lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"(Forgive me for any typos, English is my second language as I’m Norwegian &amp; live in Norway.)

I (F28) just screwed up so bad. Ironically, I travel a lot, so I bet my ADHD just got the best of me today. I just have to get this off my chest. 

I’m on a work trip, which will take place in a city in the Lofoten Islands. I had to go by plane, AKA the cause of this mess.

Apparently there were some logistical issues today with the other flights. There were several messages over the speakers, but none regarding our flight. Except our flight being delayed, everything was ok. Until suddenly, two messages were broadcasted simultaneously. One regarding our flight and one regarding the flight that were supposed to leave at the gate next to us. Apparently, our gate was changed last minute. But it was kinda hard to tell as there were two different messages at the same time. I tried asking the lady next to me, and she agreed that our flight would be at gate 20. 

So I just started walking, then I figured the group of tourists next to me didn’t get the memo. They don’t speak Norwegian and the message wasn’t given in English, so I decided to be their hero today. And also I would’ve freaked out if I were in a country where I didn’t speak the language, only to therefore miss my floghr. So I asked one of them in English  “are you going to [final destination], because we have a new gate..” He called for his group and they joined. So did another English speaking woman, as she overheard the conversation. 

We walked across the airport only to see that the screen hadn’t changed. This confused me, so I asked the lady from earlier: “You’re going [here], right?” NOPE! She’s going to the next city over with a different plane.. So I went back to the TSA and asked them. They didn’t know anything, but according to the time table our flight was still the same gate as originally planned. It even said “gate closing” so I started to freak out. Then I got the phone call..

Lady: “Hi, this is from [insert air fare company]. Will you be joining us to [city in Lofoten]?” 
Me: “Yes! I’m on my way! Where from? Gate 12?” 
Lady: “Yes.”
Me: “I’ll be there!” 

So it WAS the original gate! I was just confused as there were two messages on the speaker simultaneously… 

So yeah. 
Fortunately, the group of tourists had also got the memo. I met the English speaker on the flight, she made a remark about bad directions but I didn’t get it haha 😅 

I felt so bad so I ran to the back of the plane. Got a seat, pulled the hoodie over my head…  I was so warm and stressed out… The flight  lasted only 15 minutes fortunately. I sure hope I don’t meet them downtown… I waited until everyone came of the plane before I left haha 😂  


20 minutes later: Alright I just arrived at my paid-for-by-work hotel. They upgraded my room to a superior room with ocean view. I have this for myself for two nights. I feel better now.

,tifu,"To preface this story, I am going to start with my opinion - I do not believe what my daughter did was wrong. In fact, I am incredibly proud of her, even though she may have been overzealous, her reasoning are very much in the right place. We have discussed at length what she should do if ever in this situation again (which I hope she is not).

So, lets start in the beginning, as it is the best place to start.

(TL:DR at the bottom, as per tradition - also, just letting you all know this is a new account and my first time posting on Reddit - long time lurker - if I did anything wrong, sorry)

I, 35F, have a wonderful 9 year old daughter. She is smart, and outgoing and just incredibly strong. 2 years ago, me and my ex-husband divorced. He fell out of love with me and fell into the bed of a 21 year old, its a story as old as time, but it doesn't hurt any less. About 6 months ago, I was mugged on my way home from work. I was messed up, I was covered in bruises, and in a lot of distress mentally. My ex is not a present father, he moved to France for work about 3 months after the divorce was finalised, so he wasn't able to help look after my daughter while I was healing, she spent some time with my Mum. But she saw me at my worst.

I have a lot of guilt about that.

She began getting very anxious to leave the house, she didn't want to leave my side. She was worried Mummy would get hurt again.

A friend of mine's son was being bullied at school a while back. She enrolled him in some karate classes, not for fighting, more to build his confidence and it really worked for him. She suggested that maybe putting my girl in some classes may help her feel more secure. I suggested this to her and she wanted to do them, but wanted me to do them too. Which to be honest, was probably a very good decision - I spoke to the Sensei and asked if I could sit in on the beginners class with her etc. I explained the situation, and he agreed.

We both loved it, she picked it up so quick and she loved the play activities with the other children. A few months after we started, she was leaps and bounds ahead of me and ready to play with a more advanced level of students. The bonus of that is the night the advanced kids met, was after the beginner adults met.

So we changed out nights, I started training with adults, she carried on with the advanced kids. She has picked it up so quickly. Her confidence in her ability is sky high too.

A few times when we have been out she has seen something that has worried her, like someone walking towards us and she will grip my hand a little tighter and move herself in front of me. I keep reminding her I am the adult, we are safe and this is not her burden. (For anyone wondering, Mental Health Care is hard in the UK. We are not very well supported, she has spoken to a counceller that works with her school, she hasn't said that she needs to see anyone more, but we are on a waiting list. Therapy never hurt anyone, so why not look into it. But I can't afford to go private and the NHS just takes a very, very long time)

Fast forward a few weeks, last week was her first week back in school after the summer holidays. There was a new student in her class, we will call them Alex. Alex and my daughter have become the fastest of friends. She couldn't stop speaking about him on Monday when she came home from school. ""Alex likes this food"", ""Alex likes this TV show"", ""Alex said"", ""Alex did"" etc. Its adorable, but my kid has took it upon herself to be Alex's bodyguard. Alex is a very expressive child. They wear a school uniform, but Alex like's to wear nail polish, he has long hair which they wear pulled back or in a plait. He has bows on his shoes. He just wears what he wants and has the confidence to rock a potato sack if that is what he feels comfy in. His parents are amazing too. They have been so welcoming of my daughter and me too. We have had drinks this weekend after the incident and they are wonderful people.

So, the incident.

Last Thursday, Alex changed his black nail polish for a deep plum purple colour. Some of the boys in their class decided to show how bad their upbringing was and told Alex ""you're a boy, you shouldn't wear girly things, because thats what makes you gay"". Both Alex and my daughter told them to shut up, and go bother someone else. This is when one of the bullies says ""If you're wearing girly stuff tomorrow, I'm going to kill you."" (Yeah... you read that right).

So my girl, being a defiant little menace decided she wasn't going to tell an adult (we have had a very long conversation about this, don't worry) and she was going to handle this herself... Alex also decided he was going to handle things his own way too.

Friday morning rolls round, the plum nail polish has gone and in its place is the most beautiful and vivid pink you have ever seen and his hair was in an elaborate viking style plait. It must have took a while. It was stunning.

Well, apparently, this was like waving a red flag in front of the bully boys face. He marched up to Alex and told him he was going to kill him at lunch time. My girl told him he could try but she wouldn't let him.

Lunch came around and they were outside for playtime. True to his word the bully started to run at Alex and my girl took him out.

Now, bare in mind up until this morning I only really had the details from two nine year olds. So when Alex told me she flew, I was fairly hesitant to believe him. He told me she punched the boy in the face, made him bleed, which made him cry and now he is petrified of her.

I got a phone call from the school after lunch asking me to come and pick her up because she has been suspended for fighting. Alex was refusing to leave her and saying that if she was suspended so was he because it wasn't her fault. Alex's dad arrived at the same time I did to collect out kids, the headmaster told us that it was pending an investigation and we would be called in for a meeting on Monday.

Obviously when my daughter told me the full story I was livid, I asked why she didn't tell a teacher, she said she wanted to handle it so he knew he couldn't threaten people, but she told a teacher after the fact and they didn't believe her. So I am even more livid at this point. I contact Alex's parents and discuss, have a drink, bond over our kids etc.

So... this morning. 8am rolls around, I am sat in front of the headmaster, he begins to bemoan about how my daughter has brought violence to the school, how she has broken a boys nose and I SHIT YOU NOT, how this is very unladylike behaviour. I was honestly aghast. ""We are a zero tolerance school when it comes to violence""... My daughter had been stood on top of a little wall at the edge of the playground, essentially keeping watch. She saw the kid running towards Alex, when he got close enough she launched herself off the wall, straight at the boy. She essentially did a flying punch, landed on him and then proceeded to lock her arms in his and keep him in place until the playtime supervisor arrived.

I asked him how his investigation has gone, and he said he has spoken to the boy and because this was a ""completely unprovoked attack"" my daughter would be suspended further for the week, with a behaviour management programme and she would be expected to appologise to the boy she hit. I'll be honest guys, I have never been the confrontational type, I think it skipped a generation. But in that moment I summoned the spirit of my little girl.

I asked him how he could have completed the ""investigation"" if neither my daughter, Alex or the parents had been involved. How he had come to such a conclusion without any facts or evidence? He just stumbled over his words. I asked him ""so is this what happens when students call someone names and threaten to kill them? You punish the person protecting them"". He was silent and said it was the first time he has heard of this and that he had been told it was unprovoked and my daughter was the only aggressor. I asked him who told him this and he was silent. I then called him a liar and that he was informed of the situation because both my daughter and Alex told him. I left the meeting telling him that my daughter was not suspended, however she would not be in school until the situation had been dealt with to a satisfactory conclusion. I have emailed her teacher and asked her to forward any work she would have been doing in class and she will do it from home.

I have her with me in the office today, and my boss is letting me work from home for the rest of the week.

I know I am responsible in part for what she has done, I know violence isn't the answer. I am very proud of her for standing up for what she believes in, but we have had a talk about how she needs to always tell me things like this.

I am furious with her school. I called Alex's mum when I got out of the meeting. Alex isn't in today because they are having a meeting this afternoon about the bullying Alex has been subjected too. She has supported my actions though and said that if she doesn't get the right response today she will be pulling Alex too.

There aren't many primary schools locally that will have space left for them if the best decision is to pull them out of this school permanently, but I am not happy with how the headmaster has dealt with the situation to be honest.

Thanks for listening. I just needed to word vomit into a void.

I have fucked my daughter up royally, I know.

**TL;DR - My daughter used her karate training to defend her friend from a boy who said he was going to kill him. She broke his nose, but the headmaster is only punishing her. I am livid.**

In fact, I am incredibly proud of her, even though she may have been overzealous, her reasoning are very much in the right place. We have discussed at length what she should do if ever in this situation again (which I hope she is not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, lets start in the beginning, as it is the best place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(TL:DR at the bottom, as per tradition - also, just letting you all know this is a new account and my first time posting on Reddit - long time lurker - if I did anything wrong, sorry)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, 35F, have a wonderful 9 year old daughter. She is smart, and outgoing and just incredibly strong. 2 years ago, me and my ex-husband divorced. He fell out of love with me and fell into the bed of a 21 year old, its a story as old as time, but it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt any less. About 6 months ago, I was mugged on my way home from work. I was messed up, I was covered in bruises, and in a lot of distress mentally. My ex is not a present father, he moved to France for work about 3 months after the divorce was finalised, so he wasn&amp;#39;t able to help look after my daughter while I was healing, she spent some time with my Mum. But she saw me at my worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of guilt about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She began getting very anxious to leave the house, she didn&amp;#39;t want to leave my side. She was worried Mummy would get hurt again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine&amp;#39;s son was being bullied at school a while back. She enrolled him in some karate classes, not for fighting, more to build his confidence and it really worked for him. She suggested that maybe putting my girl in some classes may help her feel more secure. I suggested this to her and she wanted to do them, but wanted me to do them too. Which to be honest, was probably a very good decision - I spoke to the Sensei and asked if I could sit in on the beginners class with her etc. I explained the situation, and he agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both loved it, she picked it up so quick and she loved the play activities with the other children. A few months after we started, she was leaps and bounds ahead of me and ready to play with a more advanced level of students. The bonus of that is the night the advanced kids met, was after the beginner adults met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we changed out nights, I started training with adults, she carried on with the advanced kids. She has picked it up so quickly. Her confidence in her ability is sky high too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few times when we have been out she has seen something that has worried her, like someone walking towards us and she will grip my hand a little tighter and move herself in front of me. I keep reminding her I am the adult, we are safe and this is not her burden. (For anyone wondering, Mental Health Care is hard in the UK. We are not very well supported, she has spoken to a counceller that works with her school, she hasn&amp;#39;t said that she needs to see anyone more, but we are on a waiting list. Therapy never hurt anyone, so why not look into it. But I can&amp;#39;t afford to go private and the NHS just takes a very, very long time)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few weeks, last week was her first week back in school after the summer holidays. There was a new student in her class, we will call them Alex. Alex and my daughter have become the fastest of friends. She couldn&amp;#39;t stop speaking about him on Monday when she came home from school. &amp;quot;Alex likes this food&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Alex likes this TV show&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Alex said&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Alex did&amp;quot; etc. Its adorable, but my kid has took it upon herself to be Alex&amp;#39;s bodyguard. Alex is a very expressive child. They wear a school uniform, but Alex like&amp;#39;s to wear nail polish, he has long hair which they wear pulled back or in a plait. He has bows on his shoes. He just wears what he wants and has the confidence to rock a potato sack if that is what he feels comfy in. His parents are amazing too. They have been so welcoming of my daughter and me too. We have had drinks this weekend after the incident and they are wonderful people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, Alex changed his black nail polish for a deep plum purple colour. Some of the boys in their class decided to show how bad their upbringing was and told Alex &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re a boy, you shouldn&amp;#39;t wear girly things, because thats what makes you gay&amp;quot;. Both Alex and my daughter told them to shut up, and go bother someone else. This is when one of the bullies says &amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re wearing girly stuff tomorrow, I&amp;#39;m going to kill you.&amp;quot; (Yeah... you read that right).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my girl, being a defiant little menace decided she wasn&amp;#39;t going to tell an adult (we have had a very long conversation about this, don&amp;#39;t worry) and she was going to handle this herself... Alex also decided he was going to handle things his own way too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday morning rolls round, the plum nail polish has gone and in its place is the most beautiful and vivid pink you have ever seen and his hair was in an elaborate viking style plait. It must have took a while. It was stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, apparently, this was like waving a red flag in front of the bully boys face. He marched up to Alex and told him he was going to kill him at lunch time. My girl told him he could try but she wouldn&amp;#39;t let him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch came around and they were outside for playtime. True to his word the bully started to run at Alex and my girl took him out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, bare in mind up until this morning I only really had the details from two nine year olds. So when Alex told me she flew, I was fairly hesitant to believe him. He told me she punched the boy in the face, made him bleed, which made him cry and now he is petrified of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a phone call from the school after lunch asking me to come and pick her up because she has been suspended for fighting. Alex was refusing to leave her and saying that if she was suspended so was he because it wasn&amp;#39;t her fault. Alex&amp;#39;s dad arrived at the same time I did to collect out kids, the headmaster told us that it was pending an investigation and we would be called in for a meeting on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously when my daughter told me the full story I was livid, I asked why she didn&amp;#39;t tell a teacher, she said she wanted to handle it so he knew he couldn&amp;#39;t threaten people, but she told a teacher after the fact and they didn&amp;#39;t believe her. So I am even more livid at this point. I contact Alex&amp;#39;s parents and discuss, have a drink, bond over our kids etc.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"this didnt happen today but a few months ago, i still cringe about it every so often though. 

I worked as a pastry chef apprentice at a hotel and as everyone knows; the work is grueling. like the stereotypes go, i started smoking and my health went to shit. i gained 10kgs from stress even though i was more active than ever, my bosses were assholes who made us work 12hr shifts even though i was legally not allowed to but i digress- after a year i couldn’t do it anymore and decided to quit. in my last month i got a bit more relaxed, knowing i was leaving and all. on one of my last shifts i was making pretzels with another pastry coworker and the baker. 

he had the worst shift of all- 4am til 12pm. he was pretty heavyset, huge smoker and drinker. he told me he had been at that hotel for 10 years, worked as a pastry chef before switching to baking. he had done both pastry and baking apprenticeships (3yrs each) all in all i assumed he was nearing the end of his 50’s- looks wise as well. he was balding and generally looked.. older… and from the way he talked i just assumed hes had a long career beforehand yknow? so, in passing i asked him when he was thinking about retiring. both him and the other coworker freeze, look at each other and then he looks at me- i cant really read his expression. 

“im 36 years old” he tells me. 

i wanted to die so bad in that moment. rest assured we didn’t talk much after that lol im so glad i never have to go back. while i loved the work, knowing that the industry and stress can do one that dirty… good god, shout out to all gastro workers fr

,tifu,"This story starts a few years ago leading up to today.  I’ll keep the background short.  I (23f) get a job at a well known company at a very hands on job and start dating someone (21m) in another department about a month and a half later.  We don’t directly work together so theres not really any issues.  I move around to a few departments but never to his so we still don’t work directly together.  About 6 months ago I get a promotion, but still no issues because I’m not his supervisor since we’re still in different departments.  Here’s where it starts to unravel even though I was unaware of it until a few days ago.  In my department, there are 3 supervisors and we work rotating shifts.  Not long after I promote, one of the other supervisors steps down and I was assigned a lot of his shifts.  There is one guy (19m) In my department that comes in an hour after me so after we got to know each other a bit we started talking quite a bit while working since we were the only ones steadily in the department for a few hours in the morning.  He is very nice to everyone so I never thought of it as anything more than coworkers talking.  About 3 weeks ago, my boyfriend and I broke up and one of the first people I told was the guy I talk to a lot at work.  He would always ask if I had plans, and suddenly I didn’t anymore so my answer became, watching tv.  A couple weeks ago, he had mentioned a movie he wanted to go see and I had said I wanted to see it also.  About a week ago, he mentioned he had plans to see it and asked if I might want to go.  I denied because I thought it would be awkward to go to a movie with my employee.  A few days ago, he asked again if I had plans, I said no watching tv.  He told me that movie was really good and said if I wanted to he would go see it again with me.  I didn’t really say anything, then decided why not I’ll go.  We got something to eat, went to the movie, and went and sat in the park, next to theater for a while talking.  I had a good time.  The next day, we were short staffed so I called him and a few others in for some overtime which he gladly accepted.  We left at the same time and he asked if I had plans again to which I told him the same answer and he had asked if I wanted to try this restaurant he had been talking about for a few months and I had mentioned I wanted to try it but had never been.  I didn’t really respond, then sent him a message later that I would go because I wanted to try it.  After dinner we sat by the nearby river for 4 hours talking.  This is when I really really realized he wanted to be more than friends.  After talking very discreetly with another coworker about it, he had mentioned he noticed that this has been building up For a while and I was unknowingly feeding into it the whole time.  I really enjoyed spending time with him and getting to know him, but I can’t date someone in my department since I am his boss.  I messaged him explaining the situation and now I feel terrible about it.  Maybe in another timeline we could be something more, but it just can’t work without me risking my job.

I denied because I thought it would be awkward to go to a movie with my employee.  A few days ago, he asked again if I had plans, I said no watching tv.  He told me that movie was really good and said if I wanted to he would go see it again with me.  I didn’t really say anything, then decided why not I’ll go.  We got something to eat, went to the movie, and went and sat in the park, next to theater for a while talking.  I had a good time.  The next day, we were short staffed so I called him and a few others in for some overtime which he gladly accepted.  We left at the same time and he asked if I had plans again to which I told him the same answer and he had asked if I wanted to try this restaurant he had been talking about for a few months and I had mentioned I wanted to try it but had never been.  I didn’t really respond, then sent him a message later that I would go because I wanted to try it.  After dinner we sat by the nearby river for 4 hours talking.  This is when I really really realized he wanted to be more than friends.  After talking very discreetly with another coworker about it, he had mentioned he noticed that this has been building up For a while and I was unknowingly feeding into it the whole time.  I really enjoyed spending time with him and getting to know him, but I can’t date someone in my department since I am his boss.  I messaged him explaining the situation and now I feel terrible about it.  Maybe in another timeline we could be something more, but it just can’t work without me risking my job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I accidentally went on 2 dates with my employee then texted him that I can’t hang out with him anymore even though I had fun because I’m his boss.  Now I feel bad that I led him on knowing nothing could happen between us.&lt;/p&gt;

,tifu,"I (18m) work as a pizza delivery driver, and we use the store's delivery app for tracking, payments, etc. Most of the orders we get are pre-paid in the app, so we just give the pizza to the customer and leave. Customers have the option to select cash on delivery, which makes it the driver's responsibility to collect the cash when they deliver the pizza.

Well, yesterday I got a cash delivery. I'm usually pretty good with remembering things like that, and the customers have always had the cash ready in the past. This time the customer did not have the cash in their hand, in fact I don't even remember which delivery was the cash order, because they literally acted like they had paid for it already.

If you didn't know, when a driver forgets to collect cash on a delivery, they have to pay for it. The store does not cover it. This order was $37, which was more than the tips I collected all day. The amount was deducted from my pay.

What do you guys think? Is the customer in the wrong for letting me walk away? or is this one completely on me for not remembering that the order was cash?

,tifu,"Today I fucked up, well okay so firstly, not today but about a year ago I was walking to my car, which was parked behind my flat in a car park. It was 7am, I was looking at my phone and it was September and the south of England.

Little did I know, the whole carpark/path and road had frozen over night. Not just a little ice like you'd expect for a beach town, but ICE. Now, two things to note, 1, I was born with eardrum issues, 2, your ears control your balance...

So, by some miracle, I had made it to the middle of the car park before the ice decided I was now far enough from anything to grab onto and tripped me.

I proceeded to run in place like a damn looney tune cartoon until eventually I fell back and hit my head and the small of my back.

Feeling brave and strong and like the independent woman I wish I was, I proceeded to try to stand up, and made it 5 of my 5 foot 3 height before the ice took me again, this time however, I didn't run or fall, nope. I proceeded to do some kind of gymnastic/bambi/possessed splits with one leg going straight left and the other going straight behind me. Like a damn clock at 9:30.

As I was laying on the ice, it was at this point that I spotted my car, not only was it 15 feet away, but it was also incased in ice, complete with icicles connected the car to the ground.

In the most graceful zombie crawl I could manage, I crawled to my car to find the door was also iced shut. 3 hard tuggs later and finally the bastard opened and I lifted my fat ass into the seat, one leg normal and the other hanging outside and refusing to bend. Apparently unlike the rest of me, this leg is now determined to be straight...

Now, problem 2, I am now stuck here and need to call work because fuck am I going in.
This starts the 15 minute phone call with my boss who I've only worked for, for a couple months. The entire time I described the previous story, I could hear him struggling not to laugh, until the bambi flail and then he proceeded to break and historically laugh for 10 more minutes until the call was finished.

Contemplating my options, I decide to drive my car towards the flat entrance, given I can't walk the over 100 feet journey. Just one problem, my poor, old car is still cased in ice, 60 minutes of the engine running and all heaters on, I finally managed to see enough through the windshield to coast my way along.

15 more minutes of hobbling up the stairs to my flat and I collapsed on my sofa where I proceeded to be stuck with a swollen knee for 3 days.

When I finally made it into the office, limping my way along, my manager took one look at me and laughed for another 10 minutes.

And this concludes the story of how I became friends with my boss.

,tifu,"Before I start, just wanna apologize for any improper grammar or if anything doesn't make sense, this has been eating me up and it's really late. I've always had issues with friends, I've always felt like everyone has a secret negative feeling about me. Last year, I got in a class with someone who I hadn't talked to for a few months, and because they were the only person I knew, we started to be friends again. For privacy sake, her name will be Janice. So, she re-introduced me to a mutual friend of ours who I also hadn't talked to for a while, Susan for privacy. I'm not sure why we stopped talking, I think just during the summer neither of us started a conversation so nothing really happened. Anyways, we all started to be a little trio and we texted almost everyday for a year because Susan didn't go to me and Janice's school. We all started to get really close and became bestfriends. I started to notice that Susan was a bit annoying to me but I didn't say anything to her or Janice. Then, Janice texted me after her and Susan had a little disagreement and was basically complaining about Susan. This is where it went all downhill. I agreed with Janice because I had also gotten into arguments and disagreements with Susan. Fast forward a little and we texted each other about annoying things Susan had done so much that it had just become part of our friendship. I honestly have no idea why I was friends with either of them because Janice's jokes sometimes went too far and Susan just annoyed me and we didn't really have anything in common. Me and Janice started to talk about things that Susan would tell us about her personal life as explanations for why we thought she acted the way she did. For example, if Susan would say something about one of our dirty rooms, we would get annoyed, text each other, and say how *event that happened in her life* was the reason why she commented on it. I don't know if it makes sense i'm so tired. It was all fine until Susan logged into Janice's account and read me and Janice's messages because she had a feeling that we were talking shit. For context, Janice told Susan her login to her account when Janice got her phone taken away and she could message people for her. So, when Susan read some of our messages, she logged back into her account and wrote two huge paragraphs on how disrespected she felt, how we betrayed her trust, and used things she told us personally against her. And i agree, we did all those things and it was shitty. We were a pair of two faced bitches. I private messages Susan to try to apologize to Susan, and she accepted even though I think she shouldn't have, and Janice said barely anything. The only few messages she said back was defending herself and bringing up how Susan also talked shit about this third girl, let's call her Rea, and her life and how messy it was. For some context, Rea is diagnosed bipolar and I also think schizophrenic. Susan basically said that she was aloud to talk shit because Rea was horrible to her and made her life hell, which she did. I know this sounds like stupid high school girl shit but Janice's mom messaged my mom asking how is she and I can't have her find out and I know she should know but it will take away the little trust I have from my parents. I talked to Susan today and she still seems upset, understandable, but I just want both of them to go away. I feel so messed up because I don't even feel guilty about saying that stuff, although I am so spooked I will never say anything bad about anyone ever again, I just feel guilty about her finding out. This is all making me realize that I never wanted to be friend with Janice or Susan in the first place, it had just been years since I'd had a proper friend that I felt like I could connect to. It also turns out that Janice was twisting some of my words to make Susan also lose in her trust in me. I've also realized I have a lot of pent up anger from when I went through something similar like a few years ago and I think the only reason I just want to run away and hide is because I never confronted the people who treated me like doodoo and we didn't a speak after Covid. Ok I don't know what else I can add or how I make this sound better I have not proof read this I am so tired it's like midnight 
TL;DR basically i befriended a shitty person and i said shitty things about my friend about stuff she told us personally, i apologies she forgave (she shouldn't have) she only found out cause she logged into shitty friends account and read messages, we made her mom cry, shitty friends mom messaged my mom asking how she was, i scared help what do i do",t2_ii2jwy3wq,False,,0,False,TIFU by talking shit ,[],r/tifu,False,7,L,0,,False,t3_1fh6yi3,False,light,0.54,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},L,False,3,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,2024-09-15 07:24:31,text,7,,,text,self.tifu,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I start, just wanna apologize for any improper grammar or if anything doesn&amp;#39;t make sense, this has been eating me up and it&amp;#39;s really late.

Last year, I got in a class with someone who I hadn&amp;#39;t talked to for a few months, and because they were the only person I knew, we started to be friends again. For privacy sake, her name will be Janice. So, she re-introduced me to a mutual friend of ours who I also hadn&amp;#39;t talked to for a while, Susan for privacy. I&amp;#39;m not sure why we stopped talking, I think just during the summer neither of us started a conversation so nothing really happened. Anyways, we all started to be a little trio and we texted almost everyday for a year because Susan didn&amp;#39;t go to me and Janice&amp;#39;s school.

,tifu,"I (18m) work at a pizza place, and there is only one bathroom. When I got to work and clocked in, I needed to take a shit, ..baaad. I proceeded to push out what felt like an entire child, and when I saw the size of it, I was surprised my ass hole didn't rip open! I flushed the commercial grade toilet, and sure enough, it got clogged.

Now, this isn't the first time I've clogged this very toilet. In fact, last time I had to go to the Walmart across the street and buy a plunger. ""Good thing I bought this plunger, I'll just quickly unclog this"" I thought. But no, it wasn't that easy. All of the contents went down the toilet, so I could no longer see it, but the massive shit-missile had such a tight seal on the toilet pipes, that no amount of plunging was going to help.

I was freaking out, because I had been in the bathroom a while, trying to plunge this stupid fucking toilet. I googled ways to unclog a toilet, and I got the run-of-the-mill results. ""Use hot water and dish soap"" and ""call a fucking professional"" but I was obviously trying to keep this situation under raps, and I would prefer if it didn't become a news headline. ""A local delivery driver breaks the world record for the largest shit log ever recorded in human history, the toilet was irreparably damaged.""

In the bathroom, there was a floor-level sink with a mop bucket. I put blazing hot water into the mop bucket and dumped it in the toilet, hoping to boil the shit loose, I guess. What do you know, ...nothing fucking happened. That shit log was acting like it thought could save the world by clinging to the sides of the pipe or whatever. At this point, I had spent over 25 minutes in the bathroom trying to plunge the toilet, and I decided that it wasn't working.

I came out of the bathroom, and luckily nobody was waiting to use it. I grabbed a bottle of heavy duty degreaser, and dumped a generous amount into the toilet. I then let it soak for a half hour while I took a delivery. When I got back, I tried to plunge it again, but it was just as stubborn as when I started. Feel free to say I'm an unintelligent species, but I literally gave up. There was the perfect amount of water in the toilet to look like it wasn't clogged until you flushed it.

I kind of feel like I may have booby-trapped the toilet, but what was I supposed to do? Go to the manager and be like ""hey, so I layed the fattest shit humanly possible in the toilet and now it's permanently clogged."" I worked the rest of my 5 hour shift, and nobody mentioned anything, so for all I know the toilet is still occupied by the nachos I ate last night.

,tifu,"I live in Queens, NY. And I added a girl from Long Island on Snapchat just over a month ago and she is very beautiful. We had been talking for the past month and we related on a lot of things. I became very interested in her. Two of my cousins were getting married during this month as well and when their weddings were over, we made plans to go bowling. Tonight we went bowling together with one of her friends and it was amazing. She was everything I thought of and more. Beautiful, funny, and we vibed perfectly. Fast forward to when we leave, we go by her car and hug each other and that leads to use kissing for about 30 seconds. We had some alcohol (not that that’s an excuse for my following behavior) but I pulled her back in for another round of kissing and even insisted that we go to my car on the other side of the parking lot so I can kiss her a little more in private away from her friend. She insisted she had work in the morning and that she should get home. I grabbed her arm again and then let her go abruptly and she hit the car in the back but was fine and then went home. She texted me tonight saying my behavior was disgusting and that she never wants to me see me again. I was absolutely in the wrong for what I did. I will never forget her. She was everything I wanted in a girl. This may be Karma but I know I deserve it. I’ll never forget about her. And I’ll never forgive myself for my behavior.
