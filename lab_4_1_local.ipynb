Because I am the dominant female in our relationship, I really did not want to do that. And also, why am I calling him daddy dearest when I‚Äôm the mommy?

I come from an asian muslim family, in our culture its the norm for kids to stay living with their parents even after marriage. Im currently unemployed and my sister and her husband run their own small f&amp;b business. \\n\\nMy sister and her husband, barely clean up after themselves. they use the kitchen to make their food for customers and themselves and dont clean it up. They use a new cup everytime to drink water and dont wash em, sometimes theres even 5 cups just sitting by the water dispenser just from them. Their toddler makes a mess with his toys and leaves things everywhere, and spills his food everywhere and no the parents dont pick up after him, they'd just step over it.\\n\\ntoday I finally said something to my sister, to start washing the cups after they use them and not use a new cup every single time they want to drink water because im sick of washing them, and im sick of getting scolded for not washing the dishes (even though I wasnt the one using them). She exploded at me and then told me and my mom not to worry cuz she'll move out soon and then started manic packing all of their things.\\n\\nI apologized to her after but she wouldnt have it. She said that everyone has been judging her &amp; her husband for so long, but honestly if everyone is complaining that you never clean up after yourself, shouldnt the solution be you start cleaning up after yourself instead of threatening to run away?\\n\\nI understand that being a mom of 2 very young children is hard.. I help where I can and my mom is very involved in taking care of the children as well. so leaving your's and your husband's finished plates on the dining table to  lock yourself in your room and your husband leaving a mountain of dishes from cooking in the sink from noon to 6pm because he wanted to go jogging at 5pm is..going to bring out some reactions.\\n\\nmy parents dont like to see the mess and they are nearing 60 so I dont want them to be doing chores when they dont have to so I always end up cleaning up the mess. My mom is also still working a 9-5 job and she gets tired from doing all the housework.\\n\\nmy mom scolded me after the fight, cuz thats my only sister and i shouldnt be so petty with her cuz shes working hard to make money and feed her children. and now with the threat of her moving out, my mom will be seperated from her grandchildren and that will break her heart. \\n\\nso idk, am I just being too sensitive?...am I being an asshole?\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'AITA for asking a couple to take a step to the side because they blocked my view at a concert? - My gf 5‚Äô4 and I 5‚Äô6 (both 26 NB) went to a concert last night, had already gotten our view blocked by a group of people taller than us (that thankfully moved), and then got blocked again.\\n\\nThe couple 5‚Äô10 in front of me blocks my view for like 2 or 3 songs, and even though I‚Äôm trying really hard to let it go and enjoy the concert, I‚Äôm not having a good time. So eventually, I gather my nerve to tap the couple on the shoulder and ask them if they could just take a step to the right, because they had more space to the right of them. I talk to the guy, and I start saying the line I rehearsed in my head, which was, ‚ÄúHi, I don‚Äôt mean to be rude or anything, but me and my partner are having a really hard time seeing the stage. Could you two take a step to the right?‚Äù I think that wasn‚Äôt rude, and it was a good alternative from us moving outright and from being entitled and asking them to find another spot, which would just be rude as hell.\\n\\nThis guy cuts me off before I finish my sentence and motions for me to stand in front of him. He keeps repeating ‚ÄúStand in front of me. Go. Stand in front of me.‚Äù Over and over again, cutting me off every time I tried saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel comfortable doing that.‚Äù It just felt super condescending the way he was saying it, and I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable going in front of him, and I knew my partner wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable with it either. So eventually, he gives up and says ‚ÄúI offered for you to go in front of me and you didn‚Äôt want to, so don‚Äôt complain.‚Äù They go back to looking at the front, and then a moment later he turns around and says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here dancing and having a good time. So don‚Äôt complain.‚Äù\\n\\nI get mad and tell him ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been standing here for over an hour, and you two just went right in front of us. You‚Äôre being fucking rude.‚Äù\\n\\nEventually we just left the concert after that, maybe like 5-10 minutes after that interaction. I really liked that spot because we had a good view of the stage despite being all the way in the back of the venue, and we were under an AC vent so there was no way we‚Äôd overheat (my partner is on sertraline and they overheat easily now, I just have always been susceptible to heat) so our positioning was optimal and I really didn‚Äôt want to move. I was also feeling thoroughly triggered by his ‚Äúso don‚Äôt complain‚Äù comment because that‚Äôs been used to invalidate my feelings my whole life, and the one time I gathered my courage to make a (what I think) reasonable request from a stranger, I was met with that interaction. So there was no way I would be able to enjoy the concert because I was starting to cry and freak out, and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin anyone else‚Äôs enjoyment just because I couldn‚Äôt enjoy myself, so we left.\\n\\nBut I don‚Äôt know, should I have just kept my mouth shut? Should I have just sucked it up?? Or should I have just moved ?? It was halfway through the setlist, we‚Äôd been there for 2 and a half hours already in that exact same spot. Am I just dense and missing concert etiquette?',\n",

He studied pre-law while I was in animation. He graduated top of our class and went to a T20 law school. While he was in law school, I had a lot of trouble finding a job in my field or any job at all, really. I ended up working in a kitchen as a line cook to help support us (in addition to loans he took out) while he focused on his classes.\\n\\nJake got a very good job in a different state after he graduated, so I quit my job and haven\\'t gotten another one since. We have no kids, a nice house for the two of us, and are overall living very comfortably.

I\\'ve mostly been letting it go, but every single time it bothers me. I\\'m already insecure about not being able to find a good job, and it makes me feel even more inadequate. I finally reached my breaking point when we were with his mother on Sunday.

It was humiliating.\\n\\nI didn\\'t say anything at first, but I guess he could tell that I was upset and asked what was wrong. I told him that he needed to stop emasculating me and making it seem like I didn\\'t contribute anything to the household. We argued back and forth, and he told me he would stop calling me a housewife if I was going to \"get that upset about it,\" but that it wasn\\'t an untrue term and I needed to stop being insecure.\\n\\nJake refuses to apologize.

They\\'ve been seeing each other for a few months now, but this suitor has a bit of a reputation for \"kiss and tell,\" which makes my husband protective of her.\\n\\nOne night, the suitor made a joke in their group chat using a term he had previously used for his ex, which triggered my husband. My husband, not being one to mince words, asked a direct and pretty rude question to our friend. He expressed his suspicions that the suitor shared a term in their groupchat he used to describe his ex, and was worried that others may misunderstand that our friend is cheap or anything that may affect her dignity. This made our friend anxious, as she realized she might just be another topic in ‚Äúguy talk.‚Äù She confronted the suitor and wouldn‚Äôt give him a chance to explain, which led to a huge argument.\\n\\nNow, the suitor is furious, accusing my husband of sabotaging his chances and feeding our friend info to discourage her from dating him. My husband, however, did give her both sides of the story, including the good parts about him, as our friend asked for an honest opinion on the guy.\\n\\nThe suitor, feeling betrayed, told her he‚Äôs done and won\\'t pursue her anymore. He implied that if she wanted to keep seeing him, she\\'d need to cut my husband off. When she didn‚Äôt immediately do that, he stuck to his decision to walk away.

My husband (40M) and I 35(F), ‚Äúargue‚Äù about the best place to store all my holiday/birthday/seasonal decor. We have an oversized 2 car garage with a full wall of those costco storage shelves plus two more shelves on another wall. He also has a whole wall with a workbench, cabinets, and shelves. These shelves are organized pretty awfully, if organized, we could have quite a bit of extra space. I have been asking to have one of those shelves, or even a half of one, to store my decorations on. He wants to have me store my decorations under the stairs instead. Our under stair storage isn‚Äôt like a walk in closet with finished walls and floor. It‚Äôs like an unfinished basement, super spidery, cement floor. There are things we use more often like guitar cases and filing cabinets in the front of the closet so I have to use the back and around the corner for my things. To get to them I have to take out everything in the front of the closet, get down on all four and climb under a pipe that‚Äôs about 3ft off the ground, back and forth. Then do this again at the end of the holiday to put them away. It makes me just not want to decorate, so I have pretty much given up on it. \\n\\nHis argument is ‚ÄúYou only use those things once per year, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to waste easy access shelf space for something that you use once a year.‚Äù \\n\\nI say ‚Äú I have to get things out and then back in again, so it‚Äôs twice per year for each holiday or season‚Ä¶ So more like 12 times per year if I actually used my decorations.‚Äù\\n\\nAnd while I understand what he is saying, the shelf that I‚Äôve been asking to use only has mismatched home brewing items on it that he‚Äôs never used in 5 years ‚ÄúBUT, If I start making home brew, I will need to have easy access to it to work on it.‚Äù \\n\\nIt really upsets me that he stands so firm on this subject when it is seemingly such a small issue that he could just let me try out, like who the fuck cares that much when it would make me really happy and he has nothing to lose? All he has to do is organize some of his workbench wall or his outdoors items and he would have the space for his home brew stuff over there.',\n",

I did so much for this wedding and created special gifts for each bridesmaid to make sure that all of them felt important and special during this time. This is not including just the day of the wedding, but during the bachelorette and included them in the personalized gift I spent MONTHS working on for the bride.

We have one of the smaller apartments. For a few months now, one of our neighbors has been storing their kids stroller literally on top of our bikes. It‚Äôs mostly on my boyfriends bike, but it‚Äôs usually partly on my bike as well so if I take my bike out I have to take it off as well for safety.

I live in my apartment and my upstairs neighbour are a man, his adult daughter and his own mother. My problem is the fact that his daughter is really loud, she is playing games and she can be screaming for hours. Day or night. She is screaming, jumping up and down with anger or throwing things on the floor. And I can hear all of this. I can't sleep because of it, I can't work, I can't relax in my own home. She is constantly screaming. Earplugs or headphones don't work well enough. I don't know what to do anymore. Normally I wouldn't hesitate before going there and saying for her to shut up. But my problem is that I know that they are struggling. Two years ago her mother died. Also she has down syndrome. So I don't know if it's appropriate for me to go there and say anything.

       " 'AITA for choosing not to celebrate my birthday? - Okay, so, let‚Äôs start with some background information. I am a man in my thirties and I live with C-PTSD as a result of ongoing trauma in my childhood. I‚Äôve come a long way in therapy and have managed to cobble together some meaningful relationships despite the fact that my disorder is notorious for encouraging social isolation in people who struggle with it. Part of the reason we struggle to be social and maintain relationships is because people with C-PTSD have a very over active inner critic. I have spent most of my life telling myself that I deserved my trauma because I was somehow unloveable, broken, or just wrong in some unknowable way.\\n\\nThankfully, I‚Äôve found a patient a kind partner who knows all my secrets and reminds me everyday that my inner critic is wrong. He‚Äôs helped me in a lot of ways and my progress would not have come along as far as it has if it weren‚Äôt for his support. However, there‚Äôs one problem we seem to be stuck on and that‚Äôs my birthday.\\n\\nHe grew up celebrating ‚Äúbirthweeks,‚Äù and spent days as the centre of attention in his family when it was time to age up another year. I, on the other hand, hate my birthday. I don‚Äôt like having attention focussed on me, I don‚Äôt like feeling like I‚Äôm someone worth celebrating. I know this is a symptom of my C-PTSD but it still feels very real for me.\\n\\nThis discrepancy in our view of birthdays has been a cause for much tension between us. In the month leading up to my birthday he will pester me almost daily wondering what gift I want, what kind of party we should have, who we should invite to celebrate with us. It is very overwhelming and, surprise surprise, it has caused us to fight every year around my birthday, which‚Ä¶ does not help me feel any better about that day.\\n\\nHe has been very vocal about the fact that birthdays are for more than just the person aging up and that they‚Äôre a special time to celebrate the people you love. It seems to me that he feels entitled to make a big show for my birthday, while I would rather let it slip by without ever addressing it. However, because of my C-PTSD, it‚Äôs hard for me to figure out if I truly am in the right for asking to ignore my birthday when he clearly wants to very badly.\\n\\nTo be clear, I celebrate his birthday in big ways because I know that‚Äôs what he wants. I‚Äôve rented elaborate houses for our friends to celebrate in, I even proposed to him on his birthday. I do these things because I know it‚Äôs what he wants, so I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs so hard for him to respect my wishes to let my ‚Äúbig day‚Äù slide by without a fuss.\\n\\nAm I asking too much of him to not celebrate my birthday? Should I try to go along with his wishes, or keep expecting him to conform to mine? I honestly don‚Äôt know whether I‚Äôm trying to protect myself or if I‚Äôm just being an asshole, so it‚Äôs officially time to outsource this problem.\\n\\nAITA here?

Because there's 10 of us, I did insist on being paid back immediately and everyone did except for one friend and her boyfriend but in general she tends to do things last minute. She did eventually pay me back a month later after I pestered her about it.\\n\\nBut now she's backing out of going to the concert and wants to resell their tickets at 3x. I've refused to list it at that price and would prefer to instead sell it at face value to my cousins (I couldn't book for them earlier because there was a limit of 10 tickets per user and they asked me after everyone else had already confirmed). She refuses to do so because she says she's already paid for the tickets and so legally they're hers. My POV was that if I'd known she was going to flake, I would've just bought tickets for my cousins. I think it's pretty selfish of her to be making a profit off of something she wouldn't even have if not for me especially when we've complained about not getting to see other artists we care about because of crazy resale prices.\\n\\nFurther context to add is that this is the third event I've booked tickets for her and her boyfriend and they've flaked. I've learnt my lesson and will never again be booking tickets for them in the future but unsure how to resolve the current situation. My other friends disapprove of her scalping but ultimately think we should just let her do what she wants but I'm not convinced. So WIBTA if I refund her the original amount and just give the tickets to my cousins?\",\n",

We don\\'t discuss finances other than child support. I don\\'t care for any money he may or may not give to our child directly.\\n\\nYears ago I opened a savings account for my kid. I religiously transfer a set amount + child benefit into it every single month. I also put some \"loose change\" in there whenever I can.

I refused.  \\nHe told me that I can only afford that thanks to his child support contributions- I told him that the child support is his duty and is spent on our son\\'s current needs, not for him to hold it over my head.  \\nHe called me a jerk for not telling him about the account when I first opened it because now he\\'s \"8 years behind\" and won\\'t be able to match it and it will look bad when my kid grows up and only gets my support. I told him that it\\'s up to him whether or not he invests in our child\\'s future, he still has a long time to save something if he so wishes.\\n\\nHe told me I was a jerk for purposefully making him look like a \"bad dad\" for not having thought of something like this.\\n\\nI don\\'t think it\\'s fair of him to ask to jump in and claim to have contributed to the savings I\\'ve worked hard on for years, but now I wonder if I actually acted like an AH for creating a situation in which I look like the \"better\" &amp; \"more caring\" parent?

The father (M30) of my (F31) two kids (M2,5; F1) and I are recently separated but still live together and have had a few difficult years. We bought a house 2,5 years ago when I was first pregnant and him turning to the wrong \"friends\" for the renovating led to him taking cocaine, which he (allegedly) stopped, us having big problems and him still having kind of an alcohol problem and overall bad health. He wasn\\'t really there for the whole first year of the boy and whenever we need him because we are sick for example, he doesn\\'t make it. He is good in handling the boy but has problems with the girl (and crying children!). So just recently I started a very small job again after being home as a parent, and usually my dad watched the girl but today there was no other solution than for my ex to watch both. The little one wasn\\'t that happy and he refused to go an a walk with them or put them in the car (she usually sleeps then) and visit someone or anything. Only thing he does is put TV on. When I was done after 4 hours work, he lost it on me saying I am ruining the children and if I dont want to be a mother anymore I should tell him, I should be ashamed and so on. And that I should stop with the job until both go to kindergarten and take my old fulltime job again (where I would have to work weekends too, where there\\'s no kindergarten...). So AITA for leaving the kids with him and wanting to work?\\n\\nEdit after reading the first batch of comments: I didn\\'t want to write down everything cause it\\'s gonna be like a whole book but here we go: I only got to know of his drug problem after he stopped taking it (at least he says so). I knew something was wrong but not what exactly. Baby number 2 was an accident despite of taking birth control (seems to be genetic, I was conceived the same way). His alcohol problem consist of him drinking too much when he leaves the house. He never drinks at home. I work in veterinary medicine and I did think a lot about it but cancelling my shift would have been really uncool - and since he is good with the boy, k had hopes it would work out. I am already in the process of finding a solution to not live together anymore also in Cooperation with social services but so far I haven\\'t found the right solution. I still receive money for staying home with baby, I live in Germany. He has a job in an office but keeps calling out I\\'ll and he works with his own company in the cleaning field. So that\\'s how we pay the bills. Hope that solved all the questions. And yes I definitely won\\'t be doing that again, my dad watched the little on the other occasion but he\\'s on vacation right now.

We've always had quite the sibling bond and even people who don't know us sometimes mistake us for siblings because of the way we interact. I love Zara like a little sister. She was there for me when my mom passed and when my wife passed in 2021. She used to bring over food for my son and I. She and her then boyfriend and now husband would take him out of the house if I just needed to be alone and my son adores her. She's been there for me at my worst and I wanted her to be apart of a new chapter in my life. \\n\\nThe problem is that my fiance isn't really her biggest fan. When they first meet Sarah said that when she spoke to her she sounded rude and condescending, which is kind of true because Zara has a much deeper voice than most woman and is on the spectrum so she sounds monotonous all the time. I've explained that to Sarah but she thinks it's just an excuse. (I was with Sarah the first time they met and she didn't say anything rude or condescending). She's also very sarcastic so pair that with the voice and people think she's rude. She's actually very kind. She offers to take Sarah out for girls night when she and the other girlfriends of the friend group go, she's made an effort to bond with her but according to Sarah they just don't click which I was fine with because not everyone has to like each other. It's not like they're rude to each other and fight, they're quite friendly and cordial. \\n\\nSarah and I were discussing wedding plans the other day and I brought up having Zara as my best woman and Sarah shot down the idea. When I asked why she said she didn't want Zara to stick out among the other groomsman. I assumed maybe she didn't want Zara to wear a dress because she loves her dresses so I told her she'd be fine wearing a suit but she still said no and I got confused and asked if she didn't want Zara in the wedding party at all and she said yes. She said she didn't want to give  her friends and other people the wrong impression of me (which to me was very childish.) I insisted that I want Zara as my best woman because as much as I consider my fiancee my best friend and want to make her happy, Zara is also an important person in my life and I want her by my side. She got frustrated and isn't speaking to me anymore and her friends think that this means that there's something going on between me and Zara. (She's a married woman who hates cheating with every fibre of her being and I see her as my sister btw.) aita?\",\n",
       " \"WIBTA if I mentioned not knowing all of my grandparents on a writing assignment about grandparents? - I (15f) have a writing assignment for school where we are supposed to talk about our grandparents. This is (slightly) tricky for me. My dad's parents are fine. I know them. But my granddad (mom's dad) died when my mom was 3 and we never knew him. But his presence is still very strong in our family. My mom has photos of him and trinkets of his that she keeps in our house and she grew up always feeling someone was missing and wishing she could have spent some time with him that she could remember. He was always granddad.\\n\\nMy mom was 6/7 when her stepdad, or Grandpa Joe to me and my siblings, married granny. Even though my mom was so young she never saw Grandpa Joe as her dad or her real parent and she doesn't have as close of a relationship with him as she does granny. And when she had kids she introduced him as Grandpa Joe instead of just the grandparent title like the four bio grandparents are referred to. So we have grandma and grandpa (dad's parents) and granny and granddad (mom's parents) and then we have Grandpa Joe (mom's stepdad).\\n\\nThat's already a sensitive thing. Grandpa Joe hates being singled out as the only one who had his name added. But I think it would be worse if he ever found out that I wrote that I don't know all my grandparents and wrote about granddad. And then it was sort of confirmed because he and granny were over at our house the other night and they decided they wanted to see what my homework was like. My dad told them to leave it in case they deleted anything (neither are good with technology) but Grandpa Joe already saw the line about me not knowing all my grandparents and mentions of granddad. He asked why I needed to talk about granddad when I never knew him and then mentioned that I always had him as a grandfather but made him a step down grandparent to the others who didn't have their name added on.\\n\\nThey left soon after and mom told me to do what I feel is right. She pointed out it's only for school and doesn't need to be too serious or can be more personal if I want. \\n\\nWIBTA if I mention granddad and the fact I don't know all my grandparents?\",\n",

An old friend of mine told me that there is a position in his company and if I applied for it I\\'d most likely get it. The job pays $25,000 more than my current job and the environment would be so much better for me.\\n\\nI finished up the details of my resume but before I sent it off to the company my gf told me she wanted to take a look at it before I sent it off.

My girlfriend is a massive procrastinator and she always reassures me that she would do it by saying things like \"it\\'ll only take me 5 min to finish it up. I will work on it in the morning\" or \"I have a work meeting at x time so I will work on it then\" or \"let me get settled in first and then I will finish it\".

She asked me if I was angry with her and I was trying my best not to yell but I snapped back \"of course I am mad at you, it\\'s your fault\". She started crying and she called me an asshole for not being appreciative of her and that she did something good for me and now I am throwing it in her face. This is when I snapped and said \"You didn\\'t do fucking shit for me. You had 2 weeks to do this. I was happy with what I wrote and you stopped me from sending it.

I had to fucking chase you nearly everyday for this and you didn\\'t do fuck all\" she really started crying and she locked herself in the bedroom all night. \\n\\nShe snuck out for work this morning and hasn\\'t texted me.

       " \"AITA for refusing to bring back the full auntie/niblings day even though it would help out my SIL out? - Throwaway because I don't want my people that know me reading this.\\n\\nI \\\\[24F\\\\] am the youngest to 3 brothers \\\\[36M\\\\], \\\\[34M\\\\], \\\\[31M\\\\]. Yes, I was the surprise baby and yes, I was coddled growing up. They're all married and I get along really well with my SILs. Between the 3 of them, I have 7 niblings  all of them under 10 and one of my SILs is pregnant with the 8th. She's my middle brother's wife and they already have two kids.\\n\\nHere's the problem. When it used to be just 3 niblings, I used to have full auntie/niblings day where I would basically take them out from sunrise to sunset, sometimes it was in the middle of the week, sometimes in the weekend depending on my work/social schedules.\\n\\nFrom the start, I made my boundaries clear because I had read horror stories about babysitting. I basically said that I will only offer that 1 day a week of auntie fun/babysitting and will only babysit otherwise if there was extreme circumstances, for example when one of my SILs had their second baby, I was more than happy to have their toddler over for a four days sleepover until they were out of the hospital and settled at home.\\n\\nWith each added member to our days, it became my worst nightmare to handle that many kids alone. Say what you want about me but that's a lot of responsibility and a lot of kids and just one me. So I started cutting the time and mixing and matching. Still same day but for example, I take one of my brothers' kids for something fun at breakfast. Another brother's kids to lunch and the last brother's kids to dinner and I'd mix it up the next week. No one had any problems with it.\\n\\nNow that my SIL is heavily pregnant, 31 weeks, with their 3rd kid, she brought up the thought of me maybe keeping her kids all day and bringing them to stuff with the other niblings because she used to use that as a selfcare day for herself. I turned her down and told her my reasons 1) It would still be a lot of kids to handle if we merge, 5-6 and 2) it wouldn't be fair to the rest of my niblings.\\n\\nShe understood (no crazy, selfish SILs here) but I could feel her disappointment and that has me feeling guilty because I'm not a mom, I have no idea how hard it is for her. My brother talked to me after that and asked if I would reconsider if he sends their usual babysitter with me to help out? I told him I'd think about it but I don't want to be unfair to the other kids, plus, I don't know this person that he would be sending with me.\\n\\nAITA if I also turn down that offer?\\n\\nEdit: I want to say thank you for all your takes, I thought making an edit would be easier than replying to every comment, as much as I wish I can reply to everyone.\\n\\nI just want to clarify first that I came up with the whole niblings day because I grew up somewhat close to my brothers despite the age gaps. Obviously we grew a part a bit when life started happening for them, they all moved out/went to college and here I was still in middle school but we got close again when I grew up and started to relate to them more. Anyway, that's all to say that I made the day so the kids and I have a relationship and their parents getting a small break was just an added bonus- something that I may need to remind them of.\\n\\nA lot of people asked why my brother or other brothers don't have uncle days or trade off kids to give their wives time off and it's mostly because their schedules are rarely in sync unless it's around the holidays- we all get together then and they all divide the childcare among themselves, my dad pitches in too, and their wives (our mom and me) don't lift a finger. As for why parents don't help, they used to until my mom had hip surgery and they made it clear that they'll pitch in when they can but not to rely on them and my pregnant SIL's parents are hours away. \\n\\nAs for the babysitter, I don't think it's that wild that they don't send her out in public with the kids but what do I know, I don't have kids lol. If they send her out with me, I think it would be awkward and uncomfortable because what if her caring style is different than mine? What if she thinks something is okay and I don't or the opposite? Who will the kids ask permission from? What if some of the kids ask something of her and she says yes and they run off while I'm busy with the others and I end up not keeping track of them? I'm the type that I need to know where every little one is at all times and at the end of the day, I wouldn't be her boss and have no right to ask stuff of her like I am.\\n\\nAs for my SILs, the pregnant one is a SAHM while the other two work so I imagine they want to wind down at home as well in the weekends with their family, Idk, I'm close to them but I don't ask them what they do (that's just weird because they're married to my brothers) unless they volunteer it in conversation.\\n\\nA lot of you suggested I alternate between sets of kids each week but that would mean that I would only see each of them one time a month and I don't know about that yet. I know I'll have to dial back at some point and it won't always be this way but they're still so young and cute that I don't have the heart to pull the plug on our days. I do agree that we need to have a talk and that some things need to change though.\\n\\nAnd finally, how I can even afford to do this every week, I'm a tech girly and was lucky enough to land a cushy job that's also flexible when it comes to remote/office time. My social life is healthy, guys, I don't just spend my time around family and I am dating, or trying to at least. It's not easy in the 2024 dating pool- no offense to any guys I'm sure you're all lovely.\\n\\nIf I have news and you guys are interested, I'll update!\",\n",

I think the world of them, and love the time together.\\nI finally brought my first home and moved in March, my partner also moved in with me. I made sure there was a room and space for the kids. They stay with us half the week. Whilst my partner cannot pay a huge amount due to still giving money to his ex he does contribute something.\\nRecently my partner has been away on a boys tour, he does this every October and looks forward to it. During this time I sent the usual loved up messages and so did he. He was due back on the Monday the same day as me (I was working on a residential for SEN children). I had asked if we could have that evening together as I knew I would be tired from the trip and wanted to get the home in order before having the kids round for the half term holidays. He told me he would sort it, unfortunately he did not and the kids were at the home on Monday. Whilst I was disappointed that he had not sorted it, we got on.

I enquired about the bruise again and mentioned how it didn't make sense he hadn't said anything. He got angry with me when I noted his story of who was there and what happened changed. He started to say how I just never drop anything and he couldn't believe I was going on about it. He then left the room and I followed at this point he was angry and I was upset. I should have given him the space but I was upset and wanted to sort this out especially as he has been distant since returning (both of us have, but put this down to tiredness). When I followed he started to shout, I asked him to keep his voice down as the kids were in bed, he responded by saying he wanted them to hear and if he hadn't been drinking he would have taken the kids and left. \\nI left the home and slept in my car to allow him the space. I returned at aroind 1am and spent the remainder of the night on the sofa. This morning he won't even look at me and has told me he needs to decide what to do as I called him a liar. \\nI am so confused by this, I love him so much yes I should have given him the space but I was so surprised and wanted to understand. \\nWe usually get on so well, but I think I have lost him and he doesn't want to be with me anymore.

Since I was a baby she took me every Christmas to visit her family in FL. We live in IL. But during covid we didn't go for 2 years.  We went in 2023 but I wasn't sure about going this year. I've always gone along with her because I had to when I was younger, but never really enjoyed as I got older since I don't know the family that well and it's not where I grew up. I brought up that I wanted to stay and she can go by herself. I have a boyfriend and a job and I honestly don't want to go anymore.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2024 my mom got diagnosed with stage 2 parkinsons and is experiencing small difficulties with movement but can still get around and walk. When I told her I wanted her to go without me this year, she said that I need to go because I can stop her from falling. I said if she thinks she'll fall she can use a wheelchair and that she will be ok.  She kept saying I'm not gonna do that, you have to come with me. She then mentioned that this one time I left the FL trip early to go home by myself that she had an anxiety attack and that she can't do that again. \\n\\n\\n\\nI feel she may just be trying to guilt trip me, because 2 months ago she had a high school reunion invite in FL. She was undecided but eventually said she didn't want to go. But today she said I took her reunion away from her and now I'm taking FL in Christmas too because she can't go without me because of her fear of falling. I did have a planned trip to Japan in the middle of her reunion date and I told her I could take the bus to the airport if she wanted to go to the reunion, but she said she didn't want to go and ended up dropping me off at the airport. Now today during our argument she's saying I prevented her from going to her reunion because of my trip even though I suggested the bus, and was saying she would have gone to the reunion if not for my trip/taking me to the airport. So I mentioned to her, both the Christmas family event and the high school reunion are in FL, why are you saying you would have been fine traveling alone for the reunion if not for my trip but you can't travel alone for this Christmas trip? She just kept telling me to shut up.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe says I'm selfish now and horrible. I feel justified in saying I don't want to go because I've gone for so long for these yearly trips, and she can still go without me and I think she needs to get over her fear of traveling alone and although she has parkinsons now, she can still use a wheelchair. She keeps saying I could stop her from falling, but I'm not sure if I could. I want to know if this is rude of me or is it fair to not go this year? I feel like I am an adult now and I shouldn't still be expected to go and it seems unfair to me that she keeps insulting me now. No one from FL ever comes to visit us, it just feels unfair to me that we're expected to always leave and go for weeks every year, so I just wanted to take a break. I suggested perhaps I can go next year.\\n\\n\",\n",

I never really liked diamonds and was trying to find alternatives so I thought moissanite was a good option.\\n\\nJane was about 4 months pregnant. My best friend (her boyfriend) had seen a video on IG about a burnout gender reveal and wanted to do the same thing. I suggested a spot I knew that would perfect.\\n\\nMy wife and I are really big car people. We met after she saw one of my cars at a show. She DMd me and on our first date we did donuts on the spot I would later propose and the place I would suggest for them to do the gender reveal.\\n\\nAfter I proposed, Jane started acting wierd. She leaves all the group chats and she turns off her location, etc. I asked her what was wrong and tells me she is upset that \"I stole her idea\" and involved her boyfriend. I tried to explain my rationale to why I propose the way I did but she didn\\'t care. I apologized as it was never my intention to \"steal her idea\" but she didn\\'t care.\\n\\nI gave her time because she\\'s hormonal due to pregnancy. \\n\\nI learned later that she had apparently been bother about the ring for awhile. She had told another friend about it but she never told me anything even after I showed it to her before I proposed.\\n\\nMonths go by and I stop trying to apologize. I wish her well wishes for the delivery. After her baby was born I had some hope she would reach out but she never did.\\n\\nThe more time passes the more I know I did anything wrong. If you google diamond ring alternative Moissanite is the first result and a gender reveal burnout is nothing unique. She never communicated anything to me even after she knew about the ring and proposal. She made my whole proposal about herself and now have ruined a special moment.\\n\\nI told my best friend how I felt and that I\\'m owed an apology and he agreed and said he would tell her. \\n\\nI just recently learned that she told a coworker that she is never going to apologize and that she doesn\\'t feel like she did anything wrong.\\n\\nAITA for wanting an apology?',\n",

I suggested he should just bring the cake home so he could also eat it during the weekend. \\n\\nHe didn‚Äôt want to bring it home because he thought it was a hassle. He said to just put it in the freezer. I joked around and said ‚Äúyou just don‚Äôt like the cake I made‚Äù and he got very angry.\\n\\nHe said that he already said it was good, yet I'm still sad. Either way, whether he says it's delicious or tastes bad, I'll still be depressed. Why can't I just take his feedback and appreciation? And next time, he said I shouldn't make him a cake anymore.\\n\\nSo I got angry as well since I was just suggested for him to bring the cake him and he felt pressured and forced to do so.

For some context my husband and I have been together for 7 years and married for 3 years.  Here is my problem‚Ä¶ last year for the holidays neither of us went to any of our families holiday celebrations due to our son being very young at the time. This year both of our families want to get together for thanksgiving. I come from a very large family ( around 75 people in total). And my husband only celebrates holidays with his mother, father and his younger sister. A couple days ago we were discussing our plans for thanksgiving. My husband stated he wanted us to spend thanksgiving with his family due to not attending last year. For context his family lives 5 hours away from us. While my family is about 2 hours away. I reminded him we didn‚Äôt attend my families thanksgiving either the year prior. Therefore I came up with the idea and asked for his opinion today. I suggest we go see his family the  weekend before thanksgiving to spend time with his family and attend my families thanksgiving on thanksgiving day. My husband did not like this suggestion and said his mother would be disappointed. He is now distant and not talking to me. I am feeling really bad but I honestly felt like, this solution could be a compromise. So AITA??????',\n",

I also have a skin condition called HS, or Hidradenitis suppurativa/acne inversa, which I was diagnosed with earlier this year.\\n\\nThis morning I was talking to my parents about something random and my dad noticed one of my HS sores on my shoulder and asked what happened (he often mistakes them for injuries). I explained it was a flare up of my HS triggered from my bra straps and that I get them quite often, they\\'re just normally covered by my shirts, and showed him the identical sores on my other shoulder. \\n\\nMy mom commented that we\\'d have to experiment with a different type of fabric for my bras to get rid of the irritation, and I told her I mostly fix the problem by just not wearing bras at all, reserving them for outfits or situations that require them (working out, going to a special event, or wearing a shirt/dress where one would need to wear a bra)\\n\\nWhen I said that I got disappointed looks from both parents and my mom said \"well not wearing a bra is not an option\" and I just said \"agree to disagree\" and excused myself because I needed to run an errand. \\n\\nNow I\\'m wondering if I\\'m an AH for choosing to not wear a bra. I\\'m one of those people who believes women should not be required to wear bras ever, and that breasts should not be sexualized so much. The social constructs around womens chests are ridiculous.

       " 'AITA for telling my boyfriend an old fling wants to take me to Europe? - My Bf(M 34) \"T\" broke up with me (F 25) because I told him an old fling (M 30\\'s) \"G\" asked to take me to Europe &amp; pay for my passport. Just a little insight, both G &amp; T are in the Military. I\\'ve known both for a couple years. T &amp; I just started dating a couple months ago. T has had a  hard time when it comes to relationships as he\\'s been married several times. Also, T and I were in a LDR. G &amp; I messed around a couple years back, never made it official &amp; just stayed friends. He deployed, after that, we rarely talked. Sometimes G came to my state, so he would always reach out. Whenever he did, we would always go somewhere to catch up. Everything was strictly platonic. Once he left we really wouldn\\'t speak again. So recently G contacted me stating that he\\'s coming to my state before being stationed in Europe &amp; asked to catch up. (T is a reasonable man, he does realize we\\'ll both have friends of the opposite gender.)  I said yes, we chit chat a bit. Next day comes, I greet him, &amp; first thing that he says is he wants me to get my passport, he\\'ll pay for it &amp; he wants me to visit him in Europe. I was taken aback because  our friendship has been platonic. I wasn\\'t born yesterday. Usually, a man will want \"something else\" if you know what I mean?.So I never responded back, I ended up telling T after I got off work. I tell him about our backstory then on to the request. Now I need to preface this. My intention of telling T about G\\'s request was NEVER  me, thinking about going to Europe with G. It was more so coming about transparency  because of T\\'s history, I  wanted to be fully honest with him. He ended up getting mad. His reasoning  was when I started the story off, I didn\\'t state that I had no plans of going with him &amp; I did not block him, just never responded back. He said when was I ever going to tell G of our relationship, which he knows about. I could see that he was thinking  this was more of a request to go instead of me just telling him what happened. I apologized for not stating my intentions clearly, but I was not letting him know because I wanted to go, but for transparency. After some more back &amp; forth, he said he needed to sleep on it to not make any rash decisions. Hours later, he  tells me he is breaking up with me because he doesnt want to be with someone who entertain others. Tbh I was kinda in disbelief, I felt like was getting penalized for trying to be a good gf. I even showed him the messages between us. He did not care about that. He viewed it as me, entertaining him &amp; that I should have blocked him, &amp; I was \"leaving the door open\". I understood what he was saying, but I had no intentions of responding back. In my eyes, if I offer something that grand to someone &amp; they don\\'t say anything to me &amp; try to come back later, that door is shut. Was I in the wrong? All I wanted to do was make sure that our relationship was open yet I got broken up with. I\\'m not understanding, I just need a different point of view.  So AITA?',\n",

       " 'AITA For writing about my S/O in a locked journal he doesn‚Äôt have the code to?  - In November 2023 (almost exactly 1 year ago) I (29F) was diagnosed with BPD1. I took the diagnosis really hard. I immediately got on a waitlist to start getting therapy and began taking medication to manage my symptoms. \\nMy significant other (let‚Äôs call him, Zack. 29M) was very understanding initially and also said that it made a lot of sense. He was very supportive the first month‚Ä¶ or so. Then he would just use my diagnosis as the excuse for everything. Our fights, disagreements, why I did this, why he did that.\\nMarch of 2024, I finally made it to the top of the waitlist and got in to the therapy I desperately needed. A few sessions in and one thing my therapist recommended was getting a locking journal that I could write all of my most purely brutal and honest thoughts, feelings, triggers and so on in. Zack  encouraged this idea and thought it would be a healthy coping skill. I went straight to Amazon and found a decent quality leather journal with a lock that requires a 3 number code to unlock and ordered it. \\nI used it for exactly what we had discussed me using it for. Unfiltered, raw, deep personal thoughts that I THOUGHT only I would ever read. For the last 7 months, Zack never once touched my journal‚Ä¶until last night. \\nI was gone when he began blowing up my phone saying things like ‚ÄúWe are fucking done, I hate you, I‚Äôm leaving the second you get home‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you, you fucking disgust me‚Äù so on and so on. I was confused and started asking what the hell he was talking about and what happened. That‚Äôs when he tells me that he broke in to my journal and he read everything. \\nMaybe it sounds silly but it made me feel so violated and exposed. I didn‚Äôt know what to do or even say. I definitely had moments in there that I know for a fact that I wrote some really messed up things about him, including one point where I questioned if I were falling out of love with him and possibly hated/resented him. These, again, were temporary thoughts/feelings that I wrote in moments of anger/sadness/confusion and I wholeheartedly thought that the only person who would ever read them, EVER, would be me, myself and I. I said those things to vent and get them off my chest and out of my head without negatively affecting or damaging my relationship. \\nAfter I got home and tried to explain my side, it made no difference. His mind was made up and he told me he feels he ‚Äúdeserved to know the truth‚Äù. He is leaving me and he says it is solely my fault because of the things that I wrote about him in my journal. I feel so confused and conflicted because I understand where he‚Äôs coming from but I also feel so violated. I never gave him the code even, he just broke the binding just to get in to it and read it‚Ä¶ Honestly, I‚Äôm still not sure what provoked him to do so. Part of me feels that I am the AH and I am getting what I deserve but another part of me really isn‚Äôt sure‚Ä¶ so, honestly, AITA? ',\n",

I then say ‚Äúactually we have one from when I lived with you a few years ago‚Äù. He responds with ‚Äúyeah but we don‚Äôt have any recent photos‚Äù. \\n\\nThe lighting was terrible, the angle was terrible, and overall it was not the time to randomly have a father-daughter photo shoot.

His mother, who he hasn‚Äôt seen in over 10 years, lives in a village abroad where visiting is challenging, both because of travel restrictions and local religious customs that would prevent us from staying together. So, we decided to save up to bring her here for about a month after we get married/move out to our apartment, cover airport assistance for her, and take her to some places in the U.S. since it‚Äôs been so long.\\n\\nA bit of background: She used to live in the U.S. with my fianc√©‚Äôs dad, but after their divorce, she moved back to her home country with my fianc√©. My fianc√©‚Äôs dad eventually brought him back to the U.S. to live with his older sibling and go to school, as his mother didn‚Äôt prioritize his education (he had been living with her for over a year and was never enrolled in school).

After moving a couple of mobile homes onto the property (30 feet off my fence line on the back of the acreage), they mentioned plans to add a third and also operate an in-home daycare in in of them (which is not illegal). I noticed that none of this was filed with the county assessor. Their mobile homes are 30 feet off my fence line at the back of their property budding to my back yard fence. According to the city ordinance the definition of Mobile Home Park: an officially approved unified development for two or more mobile homes spaces, arranged on a track of land under single ownerships. Checked with the county assessor and no paperwork has been filed and it still shows one person owning the 3 acres. A mobile home park can not be on R1 zoned land. \\n\\nI contacted the local code enforcement officer, who confirmed that multiple mobile homes aren‚Äôt allowed on an R1 property. However, I‚Äôm now stuck because the enforcement office doesn‚Äôt seem to be taking further action.

Elk decided to drop by my place and order a courier to deliver it to Blorbus instead (it was night and Blorbus lived pretty far). I thought it was weird because I could have done it myself. After chatting a bit more, I reached a realization that Elk and Blorbus had been chatting during the periods when I tried chatting and didn't know what to make of it.\\n\\nWe eventually decided to add it in and Elk told me they'll tell Blorbus about the price I placed. I didn't charge for the rest but only the particular materials that could technically pay for my rent next month (which was a lot less). \\n\\nYesterday, I contacted Blorbus again to see how it was going and brought up the materials price. I told them they could pay it to me anytime but after a while they stopped chatting once again. I felt bad so I tried messaging them again the next morning to apologize and saw they blocked me. \\n\\nI haven't told Elk about it yet as I don't want to sour their mood, but was ITA for asking about the payment? I could have just sold it to someone else and gotten a lot more compared to the price I'm selling it to Blorbus (I was selling it at the same price Elk sold it to me a year ago and the material's price have shot up an additional 10% its former price) but I wanted to honor my agreement to Elk. \\n\\nNote: The materials I bought from Elk were non-perishables. So they had no expiration, they didn't deform (they do discolor if placed beside something that can cause discoloration) and can last for a really long time if not used. \\n\\nEdit: Just changed Friend A: Blorbus; Friend B: Elk\",\n",

That is still about a year out. It seems that the COL is much better there, I could seemingly work one job and be okay financially instead of the three I\\'m working here in order to make sure everything is covered.\\n\\nOn the face of it, makes total sense. The snag I\\'m running into is my mom. I love her very, very much but she is very difficult and has a lot of mental health issues that have really gotten her in trouble with her relationships and her employment. We have been pretty codependent and enmeshed for years, but I have been putting in a lot of work the past few years to break that cycle and set some boundaries so I can live my own life. She was raised by abusive parents who really didn\\'t know how to love her and she never learned to love herself which has affected every relationship she\\'s ever had. She is the biggest stress in my life, but I am the only one left in her life because she\\'s alienated others and I don\\'t think anyone deserves to be fully alone.\\n\\nMy little brother (31M) moved out of state, met his wife and is very happy there.

I realized that would not be as financially smart as moving to the midwest so I will not be going forward with that plan and so she is naturally disappointed.\\n\\nI know she is emotionally manipulating me, knowingly or not (or both possibly), by talking about how she wants me to go because that is what is best for me, but she was upset when she mentioned she might move there (she\\'s followed me to two different states at this point) and I didn\\'t jump at the idea. She doesn\\'t want me to not go just for her, but she sees everyone around her that is her age being surrounded by their kids and grandkids.

       " \"AITAH for wanting a courthouse wedding - I (31f) have met my person who I'll call Matt (27m), and we decided to get married. Some back story I have never cared about big celebrations or poufy dresses, and I really don't see the need to spend thousands on a party. Matt understands my thoughts, but we have different family histories. My parents had a courthouse wedding, but the marriage was half toxic and ghosting but loving when they decided to be a family. While Matt was raised in the common 2 parent upper middle-class household. We have lived very different lives with different values and experiences. We met through my niece which was weird at first because he came to pick up his niece from a sleepover, but I didn't know him, and I wasn't letting this girl go with a stranger. After everything was confirmed and settled things just went from there. I'm very introverted and he's extroverted so we started friendly then got friendlier and he proposed. Now you would think we would have problems with our families with our differences, things that include skin tone, but everything managed to fall into place. My biggest fear was my brothers and cousins wouldn't like him being that I'm the only girl and youngest of 5 and all my brothers and cousins are bulky and tall. So, I walked him into meeting the crazy that is my family, and they hit it off (thank you anime and gaming). Meeting his family felt weird and different to me but they are the nicest people that I can see so far.\\n\\nNow to my problem I don't have the best view on marriage, and I have always been careful with money so I don't see why we can't just go to the courthouse then have a family barbeque to celebrate. At first Matt was on my side saying we could use that money to buy a house or go on a honeymoon and everything was fine. Then we started telling everyone the plan and now everyone has an opinion and none of them are what I want. Matts mom who well call Debra wants her son to have a church wedding with their pastor like her eldest son did. I'm religious but not to the point of wanting a church wedding. My mom we can call DeeDee wants me to have a wedding because she didn't have one. I kind of expected this from her because she wanted me to go to prom and made it happen when originally, I wasn't going. She still brings this up and she used this very scenario to prove she's right about the wedding. Now her and Debra have started planning a wedding and have convinced Matt that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity now they all have been bombarding me to change my mind. I'm not even planning a wedding, and this is stressing me out to the point I might not want to get married. So AITAH for wanting to just get married without all the fuss?\\n\\nEdit: What I said about my brothers was to point out that I am the youngest and slightly spoiled and my brothers have always had my best interest in mind. They are my protectors, but they also call out my flaws. They are big guys and intimidating and past boyfriends have left because they are scared by looks alone.\",\n",

My close friend messaged our group chat saying, \"To those concerned and real friends, can you please give me your email address and contact number?\" To tell you the truth, I did give her my email, but it was my school email because she said it should be the one I use the most. After I told her it was a school email, she responded, \"No, not that.\"\\n\\nSo I asked her, \"What do you need it for? That way, I can give you an appropriate email address.\" I have four emails, including the school one, but the others are unused due to full storage, and I don‚Äôt have money to upgrade. She replied, \"So that I will not disown you (as a friend). Now, give it to me or else.\"\\n\\nI told her again about the issues with my emails, and she said just to use the school email then.

I mean, who doesn\\'t like to see handsome and beautiful faces? It never crossed my mind to chat with them because, to be honest, I‚Äôm the type of person who, if I see a handsome guy, would honestly say he‚Äôs handsome (not to him, but to my friends) and then forget their faces. It was never that serious. There were times when she would say, \"You\\'re all about handsome guys.\"\\n\\nI just couldn\\'t accept that she thought of me that way when I thought very highly of her.

We live with our mother 36F who is currently pregnant with another child. Our fathers both suck and aren't all that present in our lives. Me and my brother are both severely autistic as well but are on opposite ends of the spectrum.\\n\\nFor some context my mother purposely decided to have a kid that looks like her long term ex boyfriend after a chemical pregnancy she had with him. They broke up not too long ago and still talk a lot. I actually don't know if they are together anymore, its that bad. She had a kid with this guy who I said was definitely in some shady business and my mother ignored that bit what do you know I was correct. So we have to worry about the baby daddy now even though I told her not to tell him in the first place. Shes going to finally take my advice and lie to him saying that she miscarried but he follows her on facebook. More issues to be had is that my brother has severe anger issues. He has broken several monitors and controllers, which would definitely wake up a newborn baby. He also doesn't want a mixed race child in the family and this baby would be a mixed race child. No he isnt aware of it. I think I should say that my childhood was confusing and still is. All im going to say is, barricading my door to keep her from entering after every argument whilst she jammed her arms and legs through the doorframe was not fun. But she did spoil us rotten on birthdays nad Christmas and played dolls with me so... but she did destroy  the one sentimental dollhouse I had because I was going through a mental breakdown... Do you see my confusion?\\n\\nI would love another sibling. I would love to be an older sister. However, we cannot afford another child right now. My mother is wracked with stress trying to parent me and my brother. This kid is guaranteed to be autistic so how on earth will she cope? I understand she has wants another kid but this is absurd. She thought the kid would bring her long term ex boyfriend back. It will not do that. It seems like she has planned for me to do most of the raising especially when the kid is older. After all she is more interested in raising when the kid is younger. Once they reach a certain age they just aint fun anymore. She is hoping for twins. Maybe even triplets. We live in a rented 3 bedroom house. Unless the cupboard under the stairs is turning into a bedroom I dont think we even have the space for another child.\\n\\nSo thats why I just want to talk to her about this.\\n\\nThats why I have to ask.

But I don\\'t know what to do.\\n\\nEdit: She also had the full day to get her hair/makeup and stuff done before hand as she didn\\'t have work that day wither as if I did have another costume I would still have my makeup and stuff to do while in work as I work till 4pm (which she already knew) and doors opened at 6pm (it takes about 1 hour to get there)\\n\\nAITAH for being angry about this? \\n\\n',\n",

However, this hasn't changed anyone's mind.\\n\\nThe biggest thing people think is that they haven't spent a lot of time in person with each other, the most being three weeks. But I think that everyone might be being too cynical. I am fully aware that I am the only one who could make her see sense, but I don't want to. If it is a mistake, it's one that she has to make.

Had our ups and downs but things have been fine overall.\\nLena\\'s life isn\\'t super easy. She had her first child, ‚ÄúMaya‚Äù, at 16 and had a couple more before she was 24. I\\'m the godmother of the younger 2 but not Maya since I was so young when she was born. Still, I love Maya to death and l\\'ve always been like an aunt to her.\\n\\nLena has financial issues and I try to help whenever I can. I don\\'t charge to babysit, if I have extra money, \\'ll buy them a few groceries, etc. I try to do what I can financially but I\\'m not rich myself so it\\'s not always a lot. Lena also asks me for help A LOT, though, and I give what I can because I don\\'t want my godchildren going without, even when it puts me in uncomfortable financial situations.\\n\\nAnyway, Maya feels she\\'s getting a little too old to always be playing with her younger siblings so l\\'ve started taking her out with me on various outings on Saturdays. Over the past few years, Lena has started getting Maya into modeling and influencing. It was a slow start but she\\'s a super cute kid and things are starting to pickup. She knows Maya and I have this standing \"date\" for a few hours every Saturday.\\n\\nLena came to me this morning to talk about this upcoming weekend. Apparently, things are really starting to take off for Maya. Lena has already had to turn down quite a few shoots/gigs/whatever because she wanted to be considerate of our bonding time. But she says that\\'s no longer feasible because they‚Äôre starting to pay more. She doesn\\'t, however, want our time together to stop, necessarily. She just wants me to pay her the money Maya would be missing out on if she could\\'ve had a gig that day. The one she can book this weekend is apparently $400?\\nI won\\'t lie. I laughed in her face at first. I thought it was some weird joke, like \"you know, you\\'re dealing with a future superstar\" or something. But no, she was dead serious.\\n\\nShe wants me to pay for the luxury of hanging out with Maya. The conversation basically ended with the title.\\n\\nAITA for being so rude to her?\\n\\nUpdate: I talked to Maya during her lunch break at school today, as someone pointed out that Lena may pretend to be her if I texted her while she was at home. It wasn‚Äôt a long discussion. Maybe 15 minutes because they technically aren‚Äôt supposed to use their phones in school and she had to go to the bathroom to call me during lunch.\\n\\nSoooo there is a gig for $400 on Saturday BUT Maya got passed up for it. It came down to her and another girl and they got the call two evenings ago (so right before the morning Lena and I spoke) letting them know they went with someone else. The gig was never Maya‚Äôs to turn down and she‚Äôs never had another job that would‚Äôve interfered with our Saturdays. So you all were right. This went beyond just making an outrageous request.\\n\\nNot gonna lie, I‚Äôm pretty furious. Maya was so upset that her mom would lie about something like that to get money from me. She apologized a ton but I told her it wasn‚Äôt her fault and that I‚Äôm not mad at her.\\n\\nI‚Äôm taking her trick or treating tonight. I‚Äôm gonna tell her then that I can‚Äôt be around her mom right now but still love her and will always be there when she needs me. I‚Äôm gonna give her a few methods of contacting me when she needs because I‚Äôm sure her mom will be super petty after I tell her that I‚Äôm taking a step back from our friendship for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nA few things for those who brought up valid concerns.\\n\\n1. I did ask Maya about the nature of these gigs. Everything is on the up and up. She said her mom never leaves her alone with anyone and is actually pretty good at making sure she‚Äôs comfortable when taking photos. I did tell her to let me know if this ever changes.\\n2. As far as Maya knows, her mom has never tried to charge anyone else to spend time with her. I‚Äôm guessing she just tried this scheme out on me to see if she could get away with it.\\n\\nI‚Äôm bummed but I know y‚Äôall are right. This relationship hasn‚Äôt been healthy for me and I now see that I‚Äôve been allowing myself to be used. That ends today.',\n",

I was happy bc my fiance doesnt make friends easily and I was happy she had someone close .(as I travel for work semi often and its nice to have someone local in case of emergency and our family lives about an hour away from us) I immediatley welcomed her and since I have a lot of friends in the area we throw parties semi often and would always invite her. There have been a couple of situations where Clara would make me and all my friends very uncomfortable at any party we would throw, to the point one of my friends asked me to let him know if she was coming, bc he, and some of our other friends, would rather not show up. \\n\\nFast forward to this past July I was playing a show at a bar about 25 min from our apartment and dropped them off at a different bar beforehand. I told them they didnt have to come, because my fiance heres all the songs we play constantly at home, but if they did I offered to drive them home after bc I wasnt going to drink that night anyway. So half way through the show they take an uber and come watch the rest of the show and all is fine and dandy. But then, one of my oldest friends showed up who I hadnt seen in over 6 months so after the show I decided I wanted to stay and hangout with him. After about 20 min I was getting texts from my fiance saying, \"Clara really wants to go home\" so i said \"I hadnt seen this friend in a while, he never shows up for anything I wanna hang for an hour at least, if she wants to leave now she can take an uber\", and she said \"Well its $50 and you said youd drive her\" So I told her \"I will but I would like some time to hang out with my friend and catch up\". Back and forth like this for 10 min I finally caved and left. On our way home my fiance was trying to explain to me about the situation and I just kept saying \"Beggars cant be choosers, I wanted to stay Im sorry it didnt fit your schedule\" Her friend got mad at me for this and started arguing with me about it. Granted I wasnt the nicest as the argument progressed because I apologized but then immediately said \"But I am barely sorry because I still left earlier than I wanted for you\" Ever since that night I told my fiance, \"You can keep hanging out with her I would never tell you who you can and cant hang out with, but I do not want her around when I am around\" and she said thats fair.\\n\\nAll in all, I feel like an AH because this is one of my fiances only friends in the area thats just her friend, not through me, and while she has gotten closer to my girl friends than I am at this point I still feel bad.',\n",

       " \"WIBTA for taking time off around Christmas when I know my coworker will probably need it off to watch her kid? - Edited to take out my judgment of how I feel about her son. It does not pertain to the issue.\\n\\nI (mid-40sF) work at a very small business. We have 4 employees including myself, the owners (husband &amp; wife), and their daughter. The daughter (April 30F) has a 9-year-old son and as of right now she leaves early every day and works from home a few hours after her son gets out of school. This came about because she never got her son on the afterschool program list to be enrolled and by that time it was too late. This was the third time (she failed to do so in his previous school years) she missed signing him up because she never made it a priority. And she doesn't want to pay for an after-school sitter to come pick him up and watch him til 5 every day.\\n\\nI have been at this job just over 12 years and the owners have only owned the business for 3 years. I never call in sick and mostly take planned days off. I will occasionally come in on a Thursday and ask for Friday off and have never had an issue. I get 4 weeks of paid vacation a year and we are allowed to carry over a week. So beginning of this year I had 5 weeks. Another thing to note is if we take off a whole day we have the option to use as much PTO as we want. There were a few days I took a whole day off and only used 4 hours of PTO. So at this time of the year I still have enough PTO to carry over a week and still have 6 days left to use or else I lose those hours. So I want to take the week of Christmas off and that would land when her kid has no school. So she will either have to take off, bring in him, or leave him with a great grandma whose health isn't the best.\\n\\nThe thing is she never plans for anything. April just figures she will figure it out once the time comes around and then complains if she has to stress about where her kid is going to be. Or I will hear from her mom (my other boss) questioning why I am taking off. IMO that isn't my problem. She knows her son's school schedule and she can plan ahead and ask for days off. She just chooses not to.\\n\\nAnd to clarify I can't take another week off. Come now til Christmas we will be slammed with orders. These last few months are our busiest and I am the main person running the machinery and assembling the projects.\\n\\nSo WIBTA if I took that week off?\",\n",

       " \"AITA for Confiding in My Brother About My Wife‚Äôs Troubling Family Dynamics? - \\nHi, I (31M) am going through a tough time in my marriage, partly due to learning about the strained relationship between my wife (34F) and her mother. My mother-in-law (MIL) has significant mental health issues, and I‚Äôve witnessed her treating my father-in-law with shocking disrespect‚Äîshe often ignores him, leaving everyone in silence, as if trapped in an invisible standoff. Once, when my wife begged her mother to speak to us, she stood silent, unmoved. I was baffled by this behavior, wondering what I‚Äôd gotten myself into.\\n\\nThere have been multiple instances where my MIL, in a flash, cuts off contact over trivial disagreements, leaving her daughter to deal with the pain. Once, when her parents visited us from abroad, she locked herself in a room after an argument, demanding to be flown back home, which we reluctantly did. Later, I learned from my wife that this on-off behavior has been part of her entire life; her mother alternated between being loving and cruel. I started to feel that my wife hadn‚Äôt been fully honest with me about her mother‚Äôs mental health and their dysfunctional family dynamic, which seemed hidden behind a facade when we were dating.\\n\\nThis secrecy has affected our marriage. I‚Äôve noticed some behavior patterns in my wife that echo her mother‚Äôs‚Äîexpecting me to endure hardship without acknowledgment, much like her father does.\\n\\nI needed someone to talk to, so I confided in my brother about these issues half a year ago. The conversation is a bit blurry now, but it helped me sort through my emotions, as my brother was also facing some challenges. Recently, though, my MIL resurfaced with a message accusing my wife of being a bad daughter for not visiting while we were in her country. She even falsely claimed to have cancer. This rekindled the pain for my wife, who was upset by her mother‚Äôs accusation and manipulative tactics. I then discovered that my mother had been in contact with my MIL and had even shared personal details about our lives with her.\\n\\nJust today, I was chatting with my brother about our family, and he casually mentioned that my mother had asked him about our holiday plans and whether we'd be visiting my in-laws, something she could‚Äôve asked me directly. When I shared this with my wife, she became extremely upset, asking if I‚Äôd shared details about her mother with my brother. I explained that I do talk with him about issues affecting me personally, but she felt betrayed, leading to a huge argument.\\n\\nI reassured my wife that during my recent call with my brother, we hadn‚Äôt even discussed her family issues. However, I also told her that, as her husband, I need support and the freedom to talk with someone close when dealing with situations impacting my mental health‚Äîespecially given that I feel misled about her family‚Äôs issues.\\n\\nThis entire experience, plus my own family dynamics between me and our mother, has made me reflect on my upbringing in what now feels like a cult-like environment, but that's a different story. I want a peaceful and happy marriage, but with all this deception and secrecy, I‚Äôm starting to question if we‚Äôre truly compatible, and whether it would best to move on. \\n\\nSo, AITA for speaking with my brother about my wife‚Äôs difficult family situation, which she kept from me for so long? Should she be able to dictate that I don‚Äôt discuss this with anyone?\",\n",

For context on me, I have a remote job that let me move back where I'm from, which has been nice for a few different reasons, one that it's allowed me to spend time and get closer with my parents who still live there. This job also has allowed me some flexibility to work in other cities (and even countries on occasion with their permission), which I have been trying to take advantage of.\\n\\nSince I started moving around more, I've been the happiest I've ever been in my life, and as a result, I've been gone often, ensuring I am home for the important moments, holidays and if I'm ever needed. I try to keep up relationships with those at home but my parents are awful at communicating. I call them at least once a week and rarely if ever will hear from them when I am not home. I always keep up the effort, but it almost never is reciprocated even though I know they want me around, with my mom in the past successfully guilting me into staying more.\\n\\nThat brings me to my current situation, I returned home last week after being gone for a while with a plan to be home for 2 weeks. A few days in, my mom tells me that my dad has a health situation which while not life-threatening, could eventually become more serious depending on the outcomes of some treatment which he will be doing for the next few months, and began a couple weeks ago. He is doing fine, is living his normal life, but because of this I spoke with him about it and he was honest, saying that it is a serious situation, but not life or death and one that him and his doctors and trying to prevent from becoming a more serious thing, and that he is very optimistic about it. \\n\\nOf course, I knew nothing about this beforehand, and they haven't told anyone else in the family about this, unsure if they will before Thanksgiving. As a result of this, I had already booked my plans to go back to where I was for the next 3 weeks before returning for Thanksgiving. Some of this travel is refundable, some of it isn't, but of course I've been considering cancelling it in light of the news.\\n\\nMy dad pre-empted this question by telling me I should continue to travel and live my life and that nothing would change in the time between now and when I come back, after which I have no plans and can stay as long as I want or am needed. This made me feel more comfortable, and I'm also thinking that if it was truly that serious, they would've let me and my brothers know about it. \\n\\nHowever, part of me is worrying that my dad is downplaying the situation and generally that morally it would be shitty for me to leave and not be there during this time, even if I couldn't do anything and everything is fine with him as of now. Therefore, even though I had been really excited to go back where I was and part of it is not refundable, I'm considering cancelling my plans. \\n\\nSo what do y'all think, what should I do here?

In urban India the age for marriage for women is around 25-27, so I was quite surprised that she got married so early.

I also expressed how I was judgemental earlier and had thought that getting married before turning 25 was a big mistake.

I gave her a look because there's no need for that, just shut your mouth like the rest of us. I asked her not to post it on TikTok.\\n\\nThey came to our place two weeks later to pick up the weekly prep meals I make E and she was mumbling the song, still using the n-word thing.

While we were together, we had 3 boys, M11 ‚ÄúMercury,‚Äù M9 ‚ÄúJupiter,‚Äù and M7 ‚ÄúMars.‚Äù\\n\\nWhen I first got into the relationship with Venus, I started to follow the vegan diet because she wanted me to, and I‚Äôve mostly followed it even after we broke up, mainly out of habit. During this time, I had to be very careful with what I ate to ensure I got the proper nutrients, and my food bill every month was sky-high. I also had a lot of issues with depression and anxiety. About 3 months ago, I slowly started to reintroduce meat into my diet, and since then, I‚Äôve felt so much better. I haven‚Äôt had to buy loads of vitamins or carefully plan my diet to ensure I got every amino acid or avoided deficiencies, and my food bill dropped.\\n\\nI also started doing research into kids who are raised vegan and found some things that made me nervous. I read that vegan kids can sometimes be shorter and might need supplements for things like B12, calcium, and iron if they aren‚Äôt getting everything they need from their diet. None of my boys have started puberty yet, which might be okay, but since I hit puberty at around 9, it got me worried about Mercury. They‚Äôre also all in about the 5th-15th percentile for height and weight, which made me want to check in with the doctor, which also made me very concerned after I learnt that their vegan diet could have impacted this. I was never a short kid, but idk I think I just assumed they were just short for their age.\\n\\nWhen I brought my concerns to our GP, he recommended introducing meat and animal products into their diets first to see if it would help with growth before considering other options.\\n\\nSo, following that advice, 6 weeks ago I decided to slowly introduce animal products into their diets whenever they had their time with me, but it has been slow. I don't want to introduce it too fast and I gave them the choice with all the information I had and with what the doctor said. I informed Venus about this and she was furious with me, saying how I‚Äôm just doing it to be vindictive to her, when I‚Äôm not. And that if I don‚Äôt stop she is going to go back to family court and get the Child Arrangements Order changed so she has full custody of the boys and I only get visitation.\\xa0\\n\\nI told her that this was recommended by their GP and she said I had ‚Äòno right in going to the GP without her‚Äô, when that is not true, it was during my time with them I am entitled to do whatever I want.\\xa0\\n\\nShe‚Äôs calling me cruel and she‚Äôs been telling our boys that they should refuse to eat any animal products and to say I‚Äôm forcing them. When this isn‚Äôt true and every time they‚Äôve been over they‚Äôve loved trying new foods like real milk, eggs, etc. some they don‚Äôt like which is fair.\\xa0\\n\\nAITA?\\n\\n  \\n\",\n",
       " 'WIBTAH if I talked to my son‚Äôs teacher about dog tags they hand out at school - So my son 6 male started Kindergarten this year. Well his school hands out dog tags when kids meet certain learning goals. I take issue with these because it feels like another way to pit the kids who are struggling against those who aren‚Äôt struggling. I feel like it‚Äôs the same as the colored behavior charts that were used in the 90s and early 2000s. It to me feels like a way to shame those who are struggling. I can admit I may be in my feels about this since my son is one of the struggling kids. He has an IEP which gets him extra help and I honestly feel like he and other kids like him are being made to feel bad about themselves. They passed some out last week and my son didn‚Äôt get one and when I asked him how it made him feel he said sad. My kid is smart but because he was born 6 weeks early due to me developing preeclampsia he has always had developmental delays and to me this just feels like another way to belittle kids like him.

I found this out from a stepsister who messaged me out of the blue one day. She suggested I reach out to my father to let him know I was thinking of him. The whole issue I had with this is that I haven\\'t heard from or spoken to that man in over 5 years. This is excluding a chance encounter at a grocery store. He barely recognized me. The conversation was like having on with an old acquaintance. The was no \"I love you\" or \"I miss you\". The whole encounter had me in the frozen foods having a mental breakdown. I cut him off when he chose his manipulative and abusive (to me and my sister) wife over his kids. Besides the grocery store, the last conversation we had was about his wife calling my sister a lying bitch when she tried to tell my father that his wife was accusing me of being a thief. This was the nail in the coffin of our relationship with our father. He was already on thin ice by missing the birth of my sister\\'s son because of his wife. Anyways, the message about his cancer sent me through a wave of emotions. I was angry with him, but I didn\\'t want anything bad to happen to him. I told my stepsister if he wanted to talk he could message me. She messaged me back 2 days later saying I should message him. I told her I was tired of being the one extending the olive branch. I was his child. I didn\\'t get a reply, but Iwas removed from the group chat about his health. I feel slightly guilty since cancer is a serious diagnosis. I\\'m just wondering.... am I the asshole?',\n",

The bus was very crowded so I took the only open seat (excluding seats taken up by backpacks and other bags) which happened to be in the front area where elderly and handicap people tend to sit. I personally never sit there and leave those seats for others. Shortly after I sat a younger looking guy got on with a girl. He sat near me and on an aisle seat, but he was basically in the aisle. After the bus took off, for whatever reason he and the girl got up. She moved back a few seats. But he just stood there in the aisle. He stayed there for the rest of the bus ride, standing After a few stops and more and more people got on they started to crowd up near the front, since he was blocking the aisle. At one of the stops, a lady and 2-3 kids got on. Since I was in the front area I decided to leave my seat for them and find one in the back. To do that I had to pass the guy blocking the aisle. Before I even got to him he stared at me and said to me \"say excuse me bitch\" I didn\\'t even react to him, walk passed and sat in a seat. Also when I got passed him there were now 4 empty seats so he easily could have sat down and not block everyone. \\n\\nAbout 10-15 minutes go by. He\\'s still just standing there. My stop comes up.

I have been friends with Casey (29F) for about 2.5 years. We were just friends for a few months then we hooked up for about 3 months while she was getting over her ex. We stopped sleeping together when she started dating Evan. After her and Evan broke up, we did not sleep together and have been completely platonic. She started dating another guy, Aaron about a year ago and they are happy together. Evan placed a boundary that me and Casey couldn't be in the same room together alone (but could do stuff in public or with other people if at an apt) which we both stuck to. Aaron has placed no such restrictions. \\n\\nI often host events for Casey because she has a much larger social network but can't host in her apt (we live in NYC so apts are small). I enjoy hosting with her since she does most of the planning and in turn she invites me to many social events which I also enjoy. \\n\\nRecently Casey and I co-hosted a brunch on Saturday which is where Casey met my girlfriend, Jane. Casey actually encouraged me to continue dating Jane when initially in our 2nd date, I wasn't really sure about her. I also told Jane at the time we became exclusive that Casey and I had used to sleep together and she wasn't particularly comfortable with the situation. \\n\\nFor reference, both me and Jane live alone. And Casey lives with her boyfriend about an hour away by subway. I told Jane that we could have some alone time in the afternoon but did not relay that to Casey because I assumed that she had plans. The night before the brunch Casey said she was planning on napping between the brunch and us going out to Halloween parties (which she invited both me and Jane to, the parties were close to us). I would think about it. Later over text Casey said if the brunch was still going on til 6, could her and her boyfriend stay in between and I agreed. \\n\\nThe brunch went well but at 5pm Jane said she was tired and asked me to kick people out. About 7 were left from the 13 total that came. \\n\\nCasey points out that we could have had alone time on Friday, the morning before the brunch or we could have skipped the Halloween parties. She was pretty mad she had to spend 3 hours walking around Brooklyn with nowhere to go, as it wouldn't have made sense to go home then come back. \",\n",

       " \"AITA for not smiling? - I (27f) have been living with my bf(28) for awhile now. He has 3 kids(none are mine) who stay with us throughout the week. I work anywhere between 49-57 hours a week between two different jobs. I also help with child care when the kids are around. Cooking dinner, giving them simple breakfast like cereal. Help them get ready for school in the mornings among other things. On the days they are with us(Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday, and Thursday sometimes) I get up at 630-640 in the morning to get there dad up and the kids up so we can all get ready for the day. I try to take on most of the morning tasks because dad doesn't do well in the mornings and is usually grumpy. I go to work from 730-630. When I get home he usually already has the kids back from school. I usually will clean when I get home(640-930ish depending on if i also cook dinner). It used to be not as much but over the past two months he says he does everything. So I picked up the pace. When we first started dating he said since I work more he didn't want me to have to do anything around the house. Then he asked me to do more and now I feel like I do at least 80% of the house work. He says he wishes people would be more grateful to him for running around doing stuff. On his days off he has to run around sometimes. He works two days a week at 24 hours a week. The rest of the time he will run errands for his family or us. The tasks I usually ask of him is to pick up a package or mail something off. Maybe go to the store if we are out of water or toilet paper. That's it. His friends and family do ask him to do stuff throughout the week. Usually they don't take more than 2-4 hours of his time. I feel so tired and burnt out and when I show this with my body language it seems like he has a problem with it. He gets upset with me when I don't clean enough and he gets upset with me when I feel burnt out doing my household tasks. I feel like I can't win. Idk how much more I can do for him without it tearing me apart. There is more I do for us and I feel he takes it for granted. I love him very deeply. Truly I do but I feel like unless I do everything with a smile on my face, it won't be enough.\",\n",
       " 'WIBTA if I invite my boyfriend to stay with me over Thanksgiving even though my family isn\\'t including him at dinner? - My (28F) family is having Thanksgiving in my city, since both I and a distant relative (let\\'s call her Lucy, 80F) and her kids live here (our extended family is very small, so even distant relatives are close). We\\'re doing it at a restaurant.\\n\\nMy boyfriend of two years (28M) lives about an hour from me and across the country from his parents. He\\'s going to be too busy with work to go all the way to his parents\\' house and back, so I asked if he could have dinner with us. (If it\\'s relevant, my parents have met him a number of times, so he\\'s not a stranger). I asked my parents first (making clear that I totally understood if they only wanted family at this dinner so they wouldn\\'t feel bad about saying no), and they said they were fine with it if Lucy was. I then asked Lucy, and she said she was happy to include him. She made a strange comment about my father probably only wanting family present, but I assured her that I\\'d already asked him and he was fine with it. I told my boyfriend that he could come.\\n\\nA few days later, Lucy texted me saying that my father (63M) told her that he didn\\'t want any non-family present (no other partners are coming) and that he\\'d never heard anything about my boyfriend coming. This was, of course, a lie on his part. I texted back that I respect the decision, and it was probably just a misunderstanding. In fact, though, there\\'s no way it was a misunderstanding. I think my father changed his mind (or maybe he thought Lucy was going to say no anyway and panicked when she said yes), but instead of just talking to me about it, he went behind my back. This is the sort of thing he does.\\n\\nObviously, my boyfriend is the real victim in this, because I had to uninvite him, and that of course hurt his feelings. I told him that if he wanted to, he could of course still come stay at my place over the holiday (my parents are staying in a hotel, not with me) so he wouldn\\'t have to be alone, although I would understand if he didn\\'t want to be anywhere near. He said he\\'d still come. We agreed that deep down we both kind of want my parents to find out that he\\'s here so my father will feel bad for uninviting him from dinner, but we\\'re definitely not going to make a big deal about it. I talked to an older friend about this whole situation, and she said he shouldn\\'t come, and that I shouldn\\'t try to guilt my parents.\\n\\nWIll we be the assholes if he does come? I know ultimately it\\'s up to him--he was the one who was hurt--but I\\'m just trying to get some clarity here.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for the replies. Some context: My sister and I are both low-contact with our parents, but we decided years ago that it was easier to just act cordial towards them the couple times a year that we see them than to waste energy confronting them about anything. My father will never change, and my mother is too disconnected from reality to ever see his bad behavior for what it is. In this case in particular I especially don\\'t want to make a splash because I don\\'t want to make things awkward and harm my relationship with Lucy.\\n\\nMy boyfriend knows what kind of people my parents are, and he knows my MO (keep them at arms length, but act pleasant when I do see them), so he wasn\\'t all that surprised about what happened, and he was not upset about my decision to go to the dinner. \\n\\n\"But you\\'re choosing them over him.\" Maybe in some sense...but it sounds a little odd to say that when he and I both know I do not care about my parents at all and am only doing this because it\\'s my policy not to rock the boat. \\n\\n\"But what if they started making demands about your wedding? Would you just accede so as not to rock the boat then?\" I generally don\\'t see the use in taking stands \"on principle,\" but when it comes to things that actually matter to me and people I care about, I very much do not let my parents walk all over me. \\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you consider this Thanksgiving dinner something that matters to you and people you care about?\" I don\\'t know--maybe I\\'m wrong, but it just doesn\\'t seem like a big enough deal. \"But it\\'s not about how you see it; it\\'s about how your boyfriend sees it.\" Yeah, but he doesn\\'t seem too sad about it either, and he never suggested that he wanted me not to go. \\n\\nSorry if that was too long winded or if it seemed defensive, but I just wanted to get all the context out.

       " \"AITA for cutting back on family gifts - I (44f) and my husband (50m) have twins (4f). My husband has one sibling and comes from a family that see each other often and don't exchange gifts. I have a brother and his wife who have four children (15,11,9 and 7). I am very aware of everything I purchase and hate waste/clutter but we also have a comfortable lifestyle. My brothers family have a comfortable lifestyle too. The issue I have is we have been clashing over gifts and I don't know if AITA.\\n\\nThe current situation is my brothers family buy myself, my husband and our twins birthday gifts to the amount of ¬£200 total. And Christmas gifts it's the same again. I have let my SIL lead over the years and just matched what she spends roughly. Up until 4 years ago the dynamics were different as I didn't have children so they bought myself and my husband gifts while I bought each family member a gift in return.\\n\\nThe beginning of this year I spoke to my SIL as she is the gift buyer/organiser of their family. My proposal was that now we all have children why don't we just spend the budget on the children and omit the adults. I thought it would take out all the stress of trying to think of gifts for adults and buy things that neither any of us need. I admit I am not the best at thinking of gifts for people and usually end up buying a voucher of some kind to compensate. I also suggested when it was an adult birthday that it would be nicer to just meet up or go for food etc instead if a present. My SIL LOVES buying gifts for people and spending a lot of time and effort doing so. However the gifts for myself and my husband are usually things we never use or need.\\n\\nHer response was that while she understood my perspective, she does indeed enjoy buying gifts for people so she would carry on doing so for the adults. She did say that I didn't have to do it and can do what I wanted. She said that she knows the gifts aren't always needed and she would have no problem if I regifted it or gave it to charity.\\n\\nThis year instead of splitting the budget equally between the 6 of them I spent 80% of it on the kids and still gave the adults a little something to honour their birthday. 3 of their birthdays all land this week. I get stressed every time trying to work out what to buy and I'll have to do it all again in a months time for Christmas. We have hardly seen each others families over the year due to school/work etc (maybe 3 times) and it just puts it into perspective for me as I'm dropping off gifts and putting it through their letterbox with zero interaction as they're too busy to see me/us. And I just feel it is such a pointless, cold process. Is this the normal process that everyone goes through and just a part of life that I need to accept? Just to add I do not grudge getting my nieces and nephews gifts but ¬£400 a year seems excessive to me too.\\n\\nSo when Christmas is over, I intend to do as I said and not buy the adults any gifts next year.

(I watched and made sure nothing escalated, not saying it would\\'ve, but it\\'s girl code).\\n\\nHe was more touchy with her than anyone else by far, including his gf. She isn\\'t even one of their close friends. For context, Anna is curvy and beautiful, so she gets a lot of male attention, wanted or not.\\n\\nBut again, she seemed okay with it and so did everyone else.\\n\\nLater, Steve kissed my bf. It was silly. I wasn\\'t bothered by it and neither was my bf. But then I look over and Sarah is right there. She looks extremely sad and uncomfortable. She tried to play it off, but I noticed. Later, Sarah and I are talking and look over and see Steve hugging Anna from behind (Anna was VERY drunk). She once again plays it off, but her face is obvious.\\n\\nThe next morning, my bf relays a talk he had with Steve prior to the kiss. (Context: Steve and my bf are both often mistaken as bisexual.  Steve denies it, and my bf\\'s just super comfortable in his masculinity.) Steve asked if he could admit if another man was attractive. Bf says sure, objectively. And Steve said he finds men attractive, but just isn\\'t sure about \"butt stuff\". My bf walked away with the impression that Steve is interested in men, but isn\\'t comfortable saying it.\\n\\nAt the end of the night, Sarah was trying to get Steve in the car. He was blatantly ignoring her, making a big scene of being drunk until Anna\\'s female roommate was yelling at him to stop. Once my bf stood up and firmly told him to go (the only other straight man) he did. During the whole exchange Sarah looked so defeated and sad.\\n\\nNone of this is damning, but it was all just weird? It felt like he was using being drunk as an excuse to explore his sexuality and disrespect his partner with plausible deniability, even though it clearly makes her uncomfortable.\\n\\nI called Anna today and told her. She said that he\\'s always made her extremely uncomfortable. He\\'s gotten drunk and tickled her, fireman carried her while she said stop, etc. and she always thought it was weird but since no one seemed fazed, she didn\\'t want to overreact.\\n\\nShe told her roommate, and she\\'s going to present all of this (my bf and Anna\\'s sides) to Sarah so she can decide what to do.\\n\\nBut now I\\'m thinking. Am I overreacting? I don\\'t want to ruin a friend group I\\'m not really in or someone else\\'s relationship over  nothing. He doesn\\'t seem like a bad person. AITA?',\n",

I wrote the first one about romantic love and while I was debating what to write the second one on, my mother said that love is more than just the romantic kind, like platonic or familial or whatever (obviously), and that's what I did. I wrote the second poem on our trip to my grandmother's and how it made me feel, and I included in it the fact that we haven't seen each other for a long time. \\n\\nhowever, I wrote in 3rd person, like it was some imaginary family, and I don't think I've said anything inherently bad about us, just that we haven't spoken properly for a while and that we sort of re-introduced ourselves.\\n\\nbut here's where the problem lies. I got into the finals and the organization is printing one poem of their choosing from each finalist into a book, and they chose my second poem. when I read the poem to my mother for the first time though, she started crying and then explained that she understood it like I felt bad about our visit and eventually told me she didn't like the fact that her life was being exposed like that. \\n\\nI argued that literally nobody will know it's about a real-life situation, that it's my life too and I wrote it from my point of view without any direct mention of her, and, after all, she was the one who told me I could write about familial love and is complaining now that I actually did? \\n\\nI'm more hurt and confused than anything, and definitely not happy about it being published now.

He\\'s also really good at his job, and I\\'m super proud of him.\\n\\nBefore we started dating, I had a horrible 9-5 job that I was absolutely miserable at. My co-workers were assholes, and my boss was extremely sexist. On my down time, I began to write my first book.

I was getting demands for a sequel (which I did write and published), and now I\\'m getting demands for the third and the mini series.

This helpedher to achieve a good position an she started acting more arrogant and say thing like when you leave you lose afterr I said I gotta leave in one hour. A few times she was given advice and it was clear to play but she spent 10minutes just not doing anything (fine ig). She ended up wining and started mocking me saying look I won haha, I gave my queen but you still lost, grinning. This made me mad as I was leaving so I was playing my moves without thinking. After we finished she remembered that her beloved cat which we heard meowing 40mins earlier should be let in, this made me even more mad as she took a lot of time for the game as she knew I had to go.

Which in turns led to them threathening me to make my life hell and so long story short I had a breakdown and got fired.\\n\\nNow, CD knows this whole situation and still works at that place. Recently, Jelly asked him to go to a concert with her. Which normally I wouldnt have minded if it wasnt for the fact it was Jelly. He accepted and told me later on.\\n\\nSo last night we were having a conversation about it and I mentioned that it made me unconfortable that he was going to do an activity with her. At first he replied that he was just hanging with her because they work together but when I brought back what she had done to me, he replied with \" well I dont know, I work with her and she\\'s nice. She\\'s my friend.\" \\n\\nI then argued that while I understood that he needed to be cordial to her in work settings as she is his boss, he didnt have to be friends with her knowing she hurt me a lot. \\n\\nIn my mind if someone hurts someone I care about that much, I wont go around hanging out with them \\n\\nHe then closed the conversation by saying he doesnt get why he should feel guilty for doing what he likes with a friend and that I was overreacting to it saying \"you always have to make things complicated\" and that I should know that he doesnt have a lot of friends so he should take activities as they go.\\n\\nThat made me doubt myself a lot. I\\'m thinking I mightve come off a bit controlling, rude or complicated by trying to tell him not to hangout with her\\n\\nShould I apologize?\\nAm I the asshole ?\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"AITA for showing my friend how to set a timer on his son's computer to make him get off it by a certain time, making his son be angry at me? - This happened two weeks ago, and I do think that I am an asshole in showing it to him and making his son be really ticked off at me.\\n\\nMy(55 F) friend (35 M) has a 10 year old son, who for the past month on the weekends would go beyond his curfew of 9 pm to get off the computer and get ready for bed by 10 pm. He would get off the computer like around midnight but in the middle of the night, my friend would hear his son's computer turn on around 3 am.\\n\\nI went over to bring him some boxes as he and his son are moving to a new apartment in a new city in three weeks. While we were sitting down and drinking coffee and shooting the breeze about the joys of moving, thankfully, he had paid vacation time and PTO that he hadn't used up yet. He made mention about his son on the weekends staying up past his 9 pm curfew on getting off the computer to get ready for bed and then hearing him get up in the middle of the night to play on the computer.\\n\\nI made an offhand suggestion about setting a timer for his computer to turn off. He looked at me like I grew two heads. He asked is that even possible?\\n\\nI was like yeah, just look on the computer. We had to look up how to put it on, by googling it. He never knew he could set a timer for the computer to turn off. He even googled if it was possible to set the timer to allow the computer to be turned on, I didn't even think that was possible, till we found it on google.\\n\\nSo we got the son's computer set to turn off at 9 pm and wake up at 6 am.\\n\\nHe was very proud of himself for setting it up. I had told him that his son will get used to the boundaries now. Do tell him the consequences of his actions has warranted a new punishment if he doesn't follow curfew by getting off the computer by 9 pm.\\n\\nWell, I got a phone call that night from my friend, his son was ticked off about his computer turning off at 9 pm. I could hear his son screaming at him for being a bad father and that he's going to be reported for this at school. I told him, the school won't do anything beyond asking what you did, might want to drop him off and go speak with the principal about this, so whatever your son tries to get you into trouble, would be canceled out by you talking to the principal and the teacher probably would be sent a message pertaining to him so he cannot get you into any trouble since this happens at the library and at our school computers too.\\n\\nMy friend asked me if we did the right thing by doing this to him. I told him we did the right thing, he has to learn how to make due with the time he has on the computer before it shuts down, like he has to when he goes to the public library on Saturday, as the computers there shuts down at 4:45 pm.\\n\\nHis son has been constantly screaming at him for allowing me to destroy his computer time, and it is constant for the last two weeks. I seriously feel like I am the AH in this as I cheated his son out of being responsible with his computer time, but his dad asked me for advice and I gave it and his dad did it.\",\n",

So we were all having dinner, mom and dad, half siblings (mom\\'s kids with her ex-husband) and their spouses, full siblings, and me and Ash. During dinner my parents asked Ash if she\\'d heard from her siblings recently and Ash said no and she wouldn\\'t expect to ever hear from them. \\n\\nAsh was raised with half siblings who were older than her but did not like that she existed and made sure she knew she was less than in their eyes for being half. They chose no contact once they turned 18 and cut off their (shared) dad too. Ash carries some sadness around because of it. She\\'s an only child otherwise and still loves them and sometimes struggled with the little girl inside of her who really looked up to them.

       " 'AITA for choosing my BF (25) against my father\\'s wishes?  - Am I the Asshole for choosing my BF (25) against my father\\'s wishes? \\n\\nMe (23) and my boyfriend (25) started dating April of 2023. We have known each other since I was 14 and he was the guy to take me on my first date. Our teen age years we disconnected but always checked in with each other over the years. When I was 15yr I moved to SC with my mother from TN and finished high school. When i was 19-20 years old I moved back to TN with my father and his family. \\n\\nMy father (56) and mother (53) separated by the time I was 2yrs old. I mainly have always lived with my mother, but I was at a point within my life where I was going down the wrong path. August of 2020, I moved states and began living with my father because I knew it would bring the structure I needed during that point in time. During this time, I started online college, got a under paying job, and just stayed to myself most of the time. Now my father was in the military and growing up he could be rough on us kids. When he remarried, he now has 5 more children ranging in ages between (9-3), with this he has become a lot more chilled out than previous years. \\n\\nHe and my stepmother are financially well off, yearly vacations, nice cars, hosting family get togethers. Since he was previously in the military, I was able to use a grant to help me go to college. With this money we used it to pay for a car that was under my stepmom\\'s name (that I drove) while I paid for school completely out of pocket. They did not charge me rent but in return I would clean house, babysat almost daily while he ran earns and when she was working (at home). I also helped with the two German Shepards they had. (They used to breed them). If I was not at work, I was at home doing schoolwork (normally while watching the baby), cleaning, or taking out dogs. I am so thankful for them and hated to complain about anything because of everything they did for me. \\n\\nWhile living there I began to get lonely, I did not have friends in my hometown anymore and the ones I did have, my parents would not let me go see and would get upset if I spoke to them. Other than being at home I really did not have a social life anymore. When I hit 21, I did start going out to the pub on Fridays and they honestly would let me go most weekends which lasted a few months. \\n\\nThat is when my boyfriend came back into the picture. During all of this we would stay in touch. In 2021 he actually met my dad, but he had just gone through a bad break up and he did not want that to affect the way my family and I myself would view him. \\n\\nWhen we did actually become a couple, my family liked him a lot. They saw that he cared about me and I for him. He worked out of town so EVERY weekend he would make the 4-hour drive to come see me and the 4-hour drive back to work. I traded going out every weekend to him coming over, me going to his dads to just hang out for 4-5 hours at night. (We were not allowed to stay the night with each over for the first 5-6 months of us dating. I had a curfew by 1 am or he had to leave by 2am. In October of 2023 he went on an Orlando Disney Trip with my whole family and in my option it went amazing. Once we got home my dad and stepmom started saying things about him that honestly I did not agree with. \\n\\nMy boyfriend isn\\'t the type to hold open doors, and he normally did wait to see me go inside the house, except we lived in a nice neighborhood at you had to turn around and go back by the house to leave the neighborhood. On his way back out I would turn my bedroom light on, so he knew I was completely inside. (He would stop in front of my house if it wasn\\'t) He even left his out-of-town job to be closer to me even if he was taking a huge pay cut. We occasionally went out drinking together and he always drove. He would never drink as much as me since he had to drive me back home. One night we went out and saw his brother that he had not seen in years and their dad ended up coming along. We both ended up getting extremely drunk, His dad followed us to my house, I took the dogs out (Forgot the lock the cage completely) and we both passed out. \\n\\nThe next morning, I woke up to my dad yelling at us to turn off the alarm that we both slept through and him telling me to get my ass downstairs cause one of the dogs got out into the garage and chewed up a bunch of stuff. He asked me if my boyfriend drove me home drunk and I told the truth about exactly want happened. When dad went upstairs and asked him, he lied saying he didn\\'t drink and drive with me. After this he never came over again and I now had to be back from his house by 11pm. I understood because it was dangerous, and my BF completely understood too. For the next 2 months it was like this, my parents talking bad about him even after he tried multiple time apologizing. He stopped drinking completely for 6 months because of that night. He even warned me that my parents were going to tell me to either leave him or get out the house. I honestly never thought they would have just because of a bad choice and after everything we had been through. \\n\\nThe night after Christmas of 2023, my stepmom looked at me and said, \"If you are choosing to stay with him you need to hurry up and pack your things to leave.\" I had a complete melt down to say the least, I called my BF who also started freaking out. I was going to leave him, but I honestly could not do it. I see myself marrying this man, having his children. After all of this time I finally had someone in my life where I could be myself without being corrected or put down. \\n\\nI tried to go talk to my dad about him and he said, \" Out of all the things me and (stepmom) changed about you, the one thing we can\\'t change is your shitty taste in men.\"  Not to mention him bringing up that he could not take care of me later on in life because he is an amputee and is missing his left foot to lower leg from an accident, he was in at 2 years old. We continued the conversation, and I honestly said some hurtful things like \" maybe if you were actually in my life as a kid Id know what that is.\" (Him and my birth mother cheated on each other heavily when I came into the picture.) He was also always gone on duty; I maybe saw him 1-2 times a year until I was 11. I still feel horrible about my choice of words and still to this day get upset thinking about it. \\n\\nI ended up leaving that night and have lived with my boyfriend since. Parents sold the car I drove, and I never saw any of the money from it. (That was being paid for with my school grant.) Had to drop out with only 9 credits to go since I could not afford the 5K a semester. The first four months we lived at his dad\\'s trailer, and I would remember my stepmom saying, \" If you want to be trailer park trash then go ahead and go.\" We ended up moving back to SC to work for the company he did previously. \\n\\nWe now live in a beautiful 3-bedroom house, have a dog together and I just bought a new 2024 Hyundai that had 5k miles on it. Honestly for being 23 and 25 we are doing really well for ourselves. We both make fantastic money together. He pays most of the bills and just lets my worry about my own personal bills and utilities. He wants me to be able to save up to go back to school since he knows how passionate I am about finishing. I tried calling my father on holidays, his birthday, and went to a funeral to a family member he was extremely close to so I could be there to support him (his wife was not there) as I expected. Not once has he called me (other than a butt dial) to check in on me, see if I am doing okay, said Happy Birthday or just see if I am okay after Helen. \\n\\nI know this is a super long post, but I wanted to be completely transparent about this situation. I still feel horrible about the whole situation. My father is a great man, he has done so much for our country, and I would not ask for a different father. He has done more than expected for me after I turned 18. He did not have to take me back in and support me while I was going through a hard time but I starting to feel resentful because he has not reached out whatsoever in 10 almost 11 months. I also am so deeply in love with my man. He supports everything I do, never once has cussed me, put my down or spoken bad about my family. He incredibly hard working, even with his disadvantage in life. Not once has he ever let that hold him back. He grew up in extremely difficult circumstances, including being homeless at 17 after his family lost his childhood home. Everything we have today is because he has never given up on himself or us. \\n\\nReddit, \\n\\nAm I the Asshole for choosing my BF (25) against my father\\'s wishes? ',\n",

Sam is gay - he is only into men and I am female.\\xa0\\n\\nSince entering the relationship with BF, I spend most free-times and weekends with my BF.\\xa0 I introduced BF to Sam (and the friend group) and in total they met about 3-4 times. The interactions they had were minimal as it was all in group settings. The interactions were good and BF got along with my friends.\\n\\nAfter they ‚Äúmet‚Äù, Sam began telling me and everyone about how he doesn‚Äôt like BF, and that he didn‚Äôt approve of the relationship. He sent essay-length messages with reasons as to why BF was not suitable for me. I never raised any concerns to warrant these reasons, so I don‚Äôt know where Sam got them from.\\xa0\\n\\nAs time went on, Sam kept making more passive aggressive and snarky comments about BF and my relationship. One time, Sam got very annoyed when he found out I was hanging out with my BF two-nights in a row. A friend told me that Sam was messaging her that he didn‚Äôt like BF and made some insulting comments\\xa0 about me.

When I got a job, my parents started to ask me to chip in, and then little by little, I got to the point where I'm paying for everything. My mom doesn't have a job, and my dad earns extremely little. I want to complain and say no, but I feel bad given their age (54). I want to give them a good life, but it's jeopardizing not only future, but my current life experience--each pay check literally gets spent, leaving me with nothing. I'm honestly so tired of supporting them, feeling like I work and work and not get to enjoy any of the results. \\n\\nMy family has a rocky background. My dad never wants to give my mom money, because aside from making little money, he has trust issues because my mom's not the best at handling anything really. Now, my mom feels like it's my dad's obligation to give her extra cash, and she wants to have money for herself. Like I said, I already pay for everything, leaving me with nothing and debt, and my mom wants me to give her extra cash monthly--because apparently, it's SO hard not having any even though all her needs and wants are met. \\n\\nI want to move out. And I don't want to tell them. I just want to live for me. I want to be a normal child and not be burdened by responsibilities that shouldn't have been mine in the first place. I want to receive a pay check and not already expect that I won't be using any of it for me. But I feel guilty. My parents aren't bad parents. They love me both so much, and I know moving out would not only break their hearts, but also possibly their relationship (that I think only exists to now because of me, and the fact that my mom has no one else to turn to and no job to support her). I just don't know what to do. Would I be in the wrong if I move out without telling them, and basically cutting them off, given that they rely on me?\",\n",

Most of the group, including me, shared the same hobbies of swimming, drawing comics and reading books. Recently though, I picked up a new hobby of creative writing, specifically fanfiction. I knew about platforms such a Wattpad, FFN and AO3 and decided to ask a friend outside of my school, who is an avid writer on the platforms.\\n\\nAfter the friend had introduced me to some beautiful AO3 fanfictions and how the platform worked in general, I fell down the rabbit hole of fanfiction, due to its creativity and the amazing writing quality of the authors, hence I felt inspired to try and write a fanfiction of my own. I wanted to give it a shot because 1) it\\'s good writing practice and 2) It just seemed fun, though I admit I did want to get a bit of publicity on AO3, before trying to write some original content.\\n\\nI thought a bit about what fandoms to write about and I tried to think of really big fandoms to gain publicity, such as Harry Potter, BNHA etc. But I wasn\\'t interested in those fandoms and I didn\\'t want to write a fanfiction about a fandom I didn\\'t care about, so another idea came to mind.

It was suggested by one of my husband\\'s cousins who lives nearby, \"Tom\", and we all liked the idea, but the date he suggested was our anniversary, and we\\'d complete 30 years of marriage if my husband was around. I wanted the day to myself, and asked him if we could do it some other day, but he said it\\'s the only weekend everyone is free, because they all have work or studies lined up for the others. I tried reiterating that it wasn\\'t a good time, but they decided to have it then anyways. So most of the relatives who live nearby, my daughter with her husband and kids come over.

       " \"AITA to be doing this  - I have been dating this guy for a year and a half now. At first, everything was perfect never loved anyone like him, and never have I felt the feeling I felt with him. But midway we had to do a long distance because we both went to different universities. We would call each other and it went well at first but mid-way I started feeling myself fade. I felt like talking to him was a chore. I lost the joy and the happiness instead I started getting irritated easily and turned off quickly. I kept on trying to walk past it and I'm still trying. Now the problem has started recently. There was this guy with whom I had two classes starting from the beginning I could feel the tension and I would find him staring at me. When I was going to tell my friend she told me she had something to tell me so I let her go first she said the same thing had been happening to her and she went to describe the guy that when I realized she was talking about the same guy. So I didn't tell her what I thought then I tried to see if it was true but I would still find him staring at me. One day at the end of class he approached me said hello and we talked a bit a couple of days later he texted me about something from our lecture I responded and he thanked me but I didn‚Äôt respond again. I told my friend and she told me she wanted to talk to him but did not know how so I told her I would try to set them up I texted him and from there we became friends then I asked him to meet up with us I tried to set them up but it didn't work. My friend moved on but in the meantime, me and him got closer and closer. I told him I had a boyfriend and I could see he was taking it in but we kept on talking. As days went on we got closer and closer and I could still feel his eyes but as time went on it cooled down so I told myself we were just friends. But at some point I found myself waiting on his texts and staying up late to talk to him, I found myself giggling at his texts. I decided to distance myself as it was the wrong thing to do. When I was doing that I found myself sad and irritated. People started asking if we were together, which made me realize it was wrong to be friends especially when there was a weird energy. I don't know what to do I don't know if I like him or if I just like the attention. I don't know if he is playing a game or if he just sees me as a friend or if he actually feels something for me. At times the things he does and says make me think he likes me but then he would talk to me about other girls and I become the close friend he talks to. On the other hand, I know it's so wrong to be talking to him because I have aboyfriend, but I know things were going downhill for me even before he came into the picture. I don't know what to do about my relationship either, if I should wait it out or end it before things get worse. On the other hand, this guy is who my friend liked it‚Äôs not fair to her either. I'm genuinely confused.\",\n",

We all live in different states so we have to put in an effort to see each other. But she would put more effort into seeing guys than seeing us. We brought up how she would put us down to make herself seem better. And how we felt hurt by that. Things ended in nothing being resolved and we didn‚Äôt talk for a week. She texted us saying she understands we want to help her but we should apologize to her for being harsh and unsympathetic. Elsa apologized to her for the approach and a few other things. I did not. I felt as if i wasn‚Äôt the one in the wrong and I shouldn‚Äôt have to apologize for trying to help. The point of the conversation was to say her behavior isn‚Äôt healthy, she‚Äôs going to look back at this time and regret it, and how her actions hurt us. It‚Äôs been at least a month or more and we haven‚Äôt talked to Jada since. I would also like to add that some of the things i said in the argument were out of pocket but they were things I needed to get off my chest. AITA for not apologizing to her?\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'AITA for calling out my disabled mother‚Äôs brain rot? - I (m 19) am getting ready to move out of the house and has recently been evaluating how I live and what habits I want to take with me and leave behind. So far, I‚Äôve noticed so much improvement on myself (making yoga a daily thing, limiting screen time and activity making space for hobbies that I‚Äôve neglected)\\n\\nAs I am doing this I‚Äôve started to notice my family members habits and realized that we are stuck in screen hell.

She has Multiple Sclerosis, diagnosed before I was born, and has lost a considerable about of balance and mobility. Along with other health factors, this has lead her to be in her power chair for 95% of her day. From when she wakes up to when she goes to bed she is in her chair, she can stand and walk, but has to use either a walker, or her cane and my arm to do so. Even then, standing causes her intense back pain.\\n\\nShe has struggled with mental health problems for her whole life, issues relating to anxiety, depression, a suspected binge eating disorder, and possibly adhd. \\n\\nAll of these factors has lead to her daily routine looking something like this: wake up, get dressed, crochet (or another intense interest she has like beading) all day while snacking and scrolling through the most brain rotted Facebook reels you‚Äôve ever seen (ghost hunting gone wrong, aita stories that are so fake (lol),etc.), make dinner when she has enough energy, and then bed.

I‚Äôve pleaded with her to take screen breaks and practice her physical therapy exercises, get PROFESSIONAL mental health support that is not just ‚Äú5 signs you have adhd‚Äù shorts, anything.

       " \"AITA for not attending my sister‚Äôs baby shower after our miscarriage? - I (29F) and my husband (29M) found out we were pregnant in April, six weeks after my sister announced her pregnancy. We were all thrilled, imagining our kids growing up as best friends. Unfortunately, in June, we had a miscarriage. It was our second miscarriage that year, and it hit us hard. I struggled deeply, even having dark thoughts about ending my life. We tried to cope by booking a trip, listening to podcasts, attending therapy, and joining support groups, which helped somewhat.\\n\\nAfter the miscarriage, we became a bit distant from the family because I couldn‚Äôt bear to see my sister pregnant. Whenever we went out to dinner, where we usually talked and shared about our lives, we just couldn‚Äôt engage in conversations anymore. Most of the time, we went home early because it was too painful to see them. People would ask how her pregnancy was going, and she would share moments about her ultrasounds, check-ups, and milestones. We couldn‚Äôt participate in these conversations or even try to be happy for her because it triggered me and made me cry.\\n\\nThree months later, my sister‚Äôs wedding was approaching, followed by her baby shower/gender reveal the next day. We informed them in advance that while we would attend the wedding and celebrate with them, we couldn‚Äôt make it to the baby shower.

       " 'AITA for giving my roommates purse to a guy to hold? - A couple weeks ago, my roommates (21F) and I (21F) decided to go out to our college bars. My purse had broken a couple nights before so I asked one of my roommates if I could borrow one of hers. She said yes and set out all of the ones she had and said I could pick. I picked out one and asked if it was okay that I borrowed that specific one. She said yes and we both went back to getting ready for the night. We go out and all seems fine until a guy that I have been seeing for a while, John (22M), met us out around an hour in. Some information, I‚Äôve known John for a couple years but have only started going on dates with him for about a week. We are all hanging out in a pretty big group until a song comes on that all the girls love. John isn‚Äôt dancing and is standing out of the way so naturally I pass the purse off my shoulder and ask if he could hold it for me. He said yes and I double checked that he had it before I went to dance with my girls. A couple minutes later my roommate jabs me in the shoulder and yells ‚Äúgo get my purse from him right the fuck now‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt question it and went right to go get it. However, as soon as I come back she‚Äôs screaming at our friends saying that I‚Äôm a ‚Äúselfish cunt‚Äù and a ‚Äústupid bitch‚Äù for giving her things to a random guy. I told her that if she was going to continue to yell that we needed to go outside because we were in the middle of the bar and we‚Äôre going to get kicked out with her acting like that. We leave and she‚Äôs still yelling about how awful a person I am until we decide to go our separate ways. I go home with some of our other roommates and she stays out. The next morning I wake up and she texted me demanding for an apology for the disrespect I caused her. I genuinely was just looking out for her things and ensuring it didn‚Äôt get damaged or anything while I was dancing. Also, if anyone is owed an apology I believe it‚Äôs me for the names she called me. So, Reddit am I the asshole? \\nEDIT: adding some information, after my roommate asked for the apology she told me that the purse was $2,000 and that it was a gift from her mom. I had absolutely no idea about the importance of the purse before I had asked to borrow it and my roommate didn‚Äôt mention it to me until after. Had I known about its importance and how it was a gift I never would have asked for it. I even double checked with her before I took it out of her room and she told me it was fine for me to borrow. Also, while we were out it had none of her belongings in it at the time. No IDs, no money, no lipstick or lipgloss. Only my things were in it when I gave it to John to hold. Where I might be the asshole is my roommate didn‚Äôt know John well and had only met him twice before that night. I can see where she might be upset because she didn‚Äôt trust him as much as I did just because she didn‚Äôt know him as well. ',\n",
       " 'AITA for contacting a person my ex tried to hookup with? - Hi everyone,\\n\\nI would love to get some outside opinion on whether AITA in a fight I‚Äôm (30s F) having with my partner (30s M).\\n\\nFor context, I‚Äôm in a relationship with my partner for about two years. Before that, I was in a seven year relationship with a guy who emotionally cheated on me for the majority of our time together. \\nRight before I got together with my current partner I had moved from a big city to a smaller one and my partner knows that I didn‚Äôt have the easiest time adjusting to the environment here. My professional network here is very small on confined to the people I meet at my job‚Äîhaving a network is important for me and the type of work I do. \\n\\nOnto the issue. Today I stumbled upon a local article that talked about a person in my industry and I recognized her name from a time when I used to live in the larger city. She does the same type of work I do, but we never met personally, but I know _of_ her as we both used to live in the larger city for a while. So we kinda knew the same people, I remember her name but idk if she knows mine, that type of thing. I remember her distinctly because my ex, the guy I was with for a long time, was ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with her. At least that‚Äôs what he told me. I found out later that he had secretly met with her, went to dinner with her, was ultra sweet and cute to her. In short, he had a crush on her and was trying to land with her, despite being in a relationship with me at that time. She, however wanted to be friends and always turned him down (I know because I read his texts, arrest me). Eventually, their ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù faded and my ex moved onto the next person to (try to) cheat with.\\n\\nAnyhow, I realized that none of this was really her fault and that she is her own person regardless of what my ex thought of her, and so I decided to reach out. My motive was, we‚Äôre in the same small city, have both spent significant years of our career in the larger one, and we do the same type of work. Why not meet up for a coffee. I briefly chatted to my good friend, asking their opinion if that‚Äôs weird given the history with my ex, but even my friend assured me that after all it wasn‚Äôt mine or the woman‚Äôs baggage but my ex‚Äôs. \\n\\nLater in the day, I told my partner. And I know that he is very sensitive every time I mention my ex so I gave him the caveat of that this might be a sensitive thing before I told him exactly what I wrote up here. And he got so upset! He said it‚Äôs weird, and he said that I‚Äôm constantly trying to find ways to keep my ex in my life. And then later he said it‚Äôs weird that I asked my friend first before I consulted him. He also says that I asked my friend for permission, which is not true. I just wanted an opinion. My partner says that now he can‚Äôt say he doesn‚Äôt want me to message her because I already did and that I ‚Äúalways do whatever I want no matter how he feels‚Äù. He says his opinion doesn‚Äôt matter to me and I would‚Äôve ignored it anyways. He is of the opinion that if a person is uncomfortable with their partner meeting someone/hanging out with someone/speaking to someone etc. and they say that, that the respectful thing of the partner is to follow that request and not meet up/hang out/talk. He says if I requested this from him then he would not do it out of respect for me and for not wanting to hurt me. We clearly have a difference in opinion here because I don‚Äôt even think there‚Äôs anything weird going on. My ex isn‚Äôt even in the country anymore and this woman clearly didn‚Äôt want anything from him. And even if, what does it have to do with my partner. Ahhhh.\\n\\nSo now I‚Äôm sitting here and wondering AITA for having tried to connect with this woman? Is it truly that weird?',\n",

One criticism was valid but most were made based on assumptions about what I did or didn\\'t do simply because I didn\\'t talk about it in the original post. I\\'m genuinely curious if I am to blame for many of these problems was there any significant room for me to have done better?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\-----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\nMy Mother-in-Law is Living with Us, and It\\'s a Nightmare ‚Äì Need Advice\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nHey Reddit, I‚Äôm in a really tough situation right now and could use some outside perspective. My mother-in-law (MIL) is currently living with my wife and me, and it‚Äôs been nothing short of a nightmare. I thought I could handle it as long as I do what I need to do and show utmost respect to her, but it‚Äôs becoming unbearable.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\\\### Background\\n\\nTo give you some context, my wife comes from a single-parent family. Her parents divorced while she was away in college, and she sided with her mother, who has her own family issues. My MIL\\'s siblings are - according to her story anyway ‚Äì dishonest, irresponsible and manipulative, and dumped the responsibility of caring for their mother onto her only, which may have contributed to her perception that everyone else is that way, too. This background adds an extra layer of complexity to our current situation.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\\\### Current Situation\\n\\nHere are the facts:\\n\\n\\\\- Overbearing Behavior: My MIL is controlling and emotionally unstable. She often cuts people off mid-sentence and makes petty comments. Her overbearingness is sometimes matched by her occasional displays of insecurity and inferiority complex. It feels like she thinks she owns the house we pay for and has been openly opposed to my wife and my marriage from the start. She has some strangely un-adult-like behaviors and lack of common sense or social graces. For instance, the \\\\*first time\\\\* she met my aunt (my mom\\'s younger sister) she badmouthed my mom and me - my aunt\\'s own sister and nephew - to her.\\n\\n\\\\- Tension with Family: We hired a nanny to take care of our daughter for 1 year before she could enroll in KinderCare. My parents have generously covered half of our nanny\\'s fee. However, the nanny behaved disrespectfully towards both my wife and MIL. She seemed to think that my wife and MIL had similar economic and educational background as herself and almost acted as if they were her own personal assistants. Sometimes the image of Stephen from Django staring angrily at Django comes to mind (sorry, this is grossly inappropriate). She would engage in quarrels with my MIL and eventually MIL had to spell it out for her ‚ÄúI have money and I have education; you and I are not the same‚Äù which the nanny took personally. When the nanny left without notice about 6 months into her service, my mother made a tone-deaf comment praising her, which only enraged my wife and MIL. They then believed my parents encouraged the nanny to leave so they wouldn‚Äôt have to pay more.\\n\\n\\\\- Family Meetings: Things escalated when my MIL demanded a family meeting to discuss the future of our daughter‚Äôs care now that the nanny left us stranded. My mother declined, feeling it undermined their authority as elders, having me and my wife in the presence of that ‚Äòsummit meeting‚Äô. I personally think it was unwise to refuse the suggestion and didn‚Äôt think a calm discussion would hurt (assuming it would stay calm, that is). In any case, this refusal was taken as a sign of insincerity and arrogance on my parents\\' part, and MIL‚Äôs daily attitude towards me has become increasingly aggressive.\\n\\n\\\\- Threats and Violence: My MIL hates pets, and I own two cats that had been with me since the early 2010‚Äôs. She‚Äôs been mean and threatening towards them, even kicking one of them once. Another time she has jokingly remarked about taking a club to my parents‚Äô house to \"show them what‚Äôs what,\" and has mentioned slapping my wife‚Äôs father in the past, some time before their divorce, which raises concerns about her impulsive and violent tendencies.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\\\### My Feelings\\n\\nWhile my wife is caught in the middle, I can‚Äôt help but feel that she finds some comfort and perverted satisfaction in her mother‚Äôs presence, almost like a lapdog who found her way home. She used to half jokingly say ‚Äúmom is visiting me again, so now somebody can protect me from you and your parents‚Äô bullying‚Äù. The most my mom did to supposedly bully her is to (1) offer advice on raising our daughter and to be fair she had experience raising 4 kids since she herself was a kid: her young sisters when she was young and myself and my brother decades later, while my MIL had no experience ‚Äì she dumped my wife on the grandparents during her childhood while she pursued her professional career, and only came back to her life when my wife was a teenager; (2) my mom made a praising remark about the nanny. The nanny sent my mom a message saying she‚Äôs sorry for leaving early and expressed how much she genuinely cared for our toddler. My mom then promptly shared a screenshot of the message with us saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs a shame things didn‚Äôt work out with her but at least she really cares for your baby‚Äù, but to my wife and MIL‚Äôs ear it basically sounded like ‚Äúit‚Äôs too bad the nanny disrespected you and your mother and treated you like other nannies but hey at least she apologized to ME!‚Äù. The second one is admittedly very egregious, stupid, and again, tone-deaf.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThis dynamic is incredibly frustrating for me, as it feels like I‚Äôm being sidelined in my own home. Additionally, my parents think I‚Äôm too good for my wife. This is obviously hurtful to know, but I try not to dwell on it too much because I think it‚Äôs natural for any parent to feel that way about their child. However, they‚Äôve never expressed that sentiment directly to her. She just knows they feel that way - or her insecurity led her to form the right conclusion, I don‚Äôt know - and it bothers her too. I‚Äôve also noticed that my wife and her MIL feel that my parents do not treat them as real family, which has led to misunderstandings. My mom has made some comments about my wife‚Äôs appearance and fashion sense, which my wife finds hurtful. After the nanny debacle and my mom‚Äôs emotionally unintelligent input it only reinforced the idea in my wife head that she‚Äôs not real family and is even ‚Äúlower than the help‚Äù in some ways.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\\\### My Frustrations\\n\\nTo be honest, I‚Äôve always thought my wife was a bit dull. I must admit that I am not entirely innocent in all of this. Our marriage is, quite frankly, one of laziness on my part. We don‚Äôt have any real common interests or hobbies or books we both like, not because we liked different things and they do not align, but because she simply doesn‚Äôt have any hobbies, or interests, nor is she well-read. When she complains/claims my parents see her as a nanny or rube, and I often stop short of saying ‚Äúthen stop dressing like one‚Äù for fear of that comment being irreversible. In my mind I know frugality is a virtue and a good thing, and that she has it and I don‚Äôt, but my vanity would still make me embarrassed when I think of the fact that she doesn‚Äôt dress well, doesn‚Äôt wear makeup, doesn‚Äôt do anything to remove the little whiskers on her upper lip and is the only young woman I know that doesn‚Äôt have any type of ear piercing. The main reason I married her was a simple one ‚Äì she was easy to talk to, nice, and didn‚Äôt give me any aggravation. It‚Äôs quite sad but I never believed in love and didn‚Äôt bother looking for it. Now having this MIL following us around all the time yields a net aggravation on my life which defeats the only purpose of this marriage. And if my motivation in this marriage saddens you, annoys you, makes me seem like a self-centered and irresponsible jerk, it should. And I applaud and appreciate you for your right mindset. Don‚Äôt be like me.\\n\\nCurrently, I‚Äôm going through my MIL‚Äôs third consecutive half-year visit. Despite my efforts to keep the peace, she finds new things to be upset about every day. For example, today, when I was looking at what ingredients we have in the fridge, she complained I was looking at it for too long. It‚Äôs my house and my fridge! I explained I was just thinking of what to cook, but she stormed off and refused to acknowledge me for the rest of the day. Didn‚Äôt like my tone, or the fact that I dared to talk back, or both, I guess. I think that might be the last straw. In the past, I admit there were plenty of things I could‚Äôve handled better. I could have been more accommodating as a host, but today is different because I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. In fact this whole week I‚Äôd been extremely careful not to hurt her fragile sensibilities.\\n\\n\\\\### My Dilemma\\n\\nHere‚Äôs where my dilemma lies: While I can ask her to leave or tell my wife she‚Äôs not welcome, I fear that would lead to my wife divorcing me and trying to take our daughter. I‚Äôve never tried to prevent my wife from seeing her mother; I‚Äôve suggested they visit her in her home or that she can buy a place nearby. But I suspect my wife would rather take our child than allow me to live without her mother‚Äôs aggravation. \\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\\\### Seeking Advice\\n\\nGiven the escalating situation, I‚Äôm seriously considering the possibility of evicting my MIL. If I were to go down that route, what‚Äôs the best way to do it? What precautions, including those pertaining to personal safety, should I take? I don‚Äôt want things to get messy or dangerous, but should I buy a gun? Additionally, if my wife decides to fight me for custody of our daughter, what type of legal precautions should I take to strengthen my case? Should I record conversations that demonstrate my MIL‚Äôs mental instability and how it would create a harmful environment for my child? I‚Äôm feeling trapped and frustrated. This situation is creating a lot of tension, and I don‚Äôt know how to address it without escalating things further. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you cope? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for your help. I‚Äôd be happy to answer any questions or fill in any blanks.\\n\\n  \\n\\\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEDIT: I see some comments remarking how I didn\\'t defend or stand up for my wife. I didn\\'t talk about me standing up for my wife from my mother\\'s microaggression because they\\'re not very relevant to this story. My wife felt that she was \\'lower than the help\\' because (1) she assumed my parents encouraged the nanny\\'s disrepect and because (2) my mother (whom my wife already suspected of sabotage), in her infinite inability to read the room, said something positive about the nanny right after she ditched us, and also (3) because of something my dad said:\\n\\nRight after my mother texted some nice words about that nanny in the family group text, my wife replied complaining about what the nanny did and what her faults were, but did it in a highly sarcastic and passive-aggressive way, while insinuating my mom was behind it all. Sensing that things were getting unfriendly, my dad chimed in basically saying \"I see, in that case it\\'s probably a good thing that she left\" referring to the fact you obviously won\\'t want to eat food prepared by someone who is angry at you or have that person handle kitchen knives, or have access to your house key, or look after the baby! But somehow my wife interpreted that, again, as some sort of defense of the nanny and snapped at my dad, which both angered and confused him because he was trying to diffuse the situation. After that, they didn\\'t talk for weeks while I tried to work things out and talk to everybody and clarify what everyone meant (while the MIL worked against me by feeding my wife more venom). Eventually, after the MIL left, things improved between my wife and my parents, which never would\\'ve happened while MIL was here fanning the flames.\\n\\nMind you, to this day, my parents never chastised her for her reaction that day. They did let bygones be bygones and never brought it up again. \\xa0\\n\\n  \\nAs for previous microaggressive remarks my mom said in earlier years, I ALWAYS protested them verbally and physically too, by getting up and leaving immediately as soon as she started to do that. I\\'d even tell my dad about it and they would argue severely afterwards. Of course my wife doesn\\'t know my father defended her because I\\'d never tell her my mother said those things about her in the first place. But my mom never learned the lesson until my wife flipped out at her; only then did she take it seriously. Some time ago I said to mom \"I told you so\". She didn\\'t respond.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I know I messed up by entertaining the conversation but I said, I'm not exactly sure what happened, but I don't think hes coming back. He took it as he found another job and did a no call no show. So I texted her to let her know the guys were already asking questions and I told her what I said. At the time not thinking it was a bad thing. She got upset that I said something period. I apologized over and over and told her I would talk to her brother and tell him that it was me, that I wanted to make things right. The way she told me about what happened to him was that A, then B and then C happened. About an hour later she texts me saying that all the guys know and that they know everything. A, B and C, that her cousin (who also works with us) is texting her and she sends me the screen shots. I told her I don't know how they found out exactly about A, B and C but it was not me that told them all that, I swear on our friendship. All she said was I trusted you to not say anything. I totally understand, but now she is ignoring me. I told her brother and he said it's ok don't worry about it.\\n\\n That happened Friday, Monday I see her at work and waved at her, she just turned around. Today, Tuesday I'm being told by the guys that his mugshot is in the news and they are talking about how did he get caught. I'm thinking to myself, I thought they knew everything? She said they knew everything. Now I'm thinking that because she was so upset that I said something that she just wanted to add more fuel to the fire and say that they knew A, B and C just to make me look even worse. Not including Friday, it's been 4 days that she has been ignoring me and avoiding me at work. \\n\\nI've never been in a healthy relationship, but I've been toxic relationships and this is how things were with them.

I stay in the basement that was converted to an apartment for grandma (since passed) when I was very young. I work full time and buy my own stuff. However, we do share food and I eat with them at dinner. I will occasionally buy myself a bottle of crown royal and will occasionally have a small glass. I don‚Äôt drink often but when I do I like to drink crown. The last two bottles I bought were the Vanilla and the peach flavored ones. The Peach one currently only has a shots worth left in it, but the only time I had some of it was a shot I had when I first bought it a month ago. The vanilla is completely gone and I only had one small glass of it. The peach was the small sized bottle and the vanilla was a bigger bottle.

I know it‚Äôs not the same as paying rent, but they have said they don‚Äôt want to charge me rent. I do realize I this post makes me sound a little entitled or spoiled. But again, I‚Äôm not actually upset about the drinking my whiskey as I am aware it‚Äôs only fair as I get to eat food and what not they pay for.

I also suggested she rent a little storage room to store her books so that we open up the space and put nicer furniture ,potentially a closet for her, which she both refused. I am also quite frustrated that she has to go into my room everyday to get her clothes.\\n\\nI know that it is a difficult situation that she also is affected by but any home improvements she rejects. Whenever I tell her to throw away anything she immediately it turns down because ‚Äúit was expensive‚Äù or ‚Äúit was a gift‚Äù when she hasn‚Äôt even used it in the past 10 years.\\n\\nMy dad gave me this old suitcase that I decided to throw out as we don‚Äôt need it/don‚Äôt have the space to store it but my mom insists on keeping it. I think I‚Äôm going to throw it out and initiate a conversation with her as to what to do with all the stuff.\\n\\nIf you have any advice on what to do please comment below I really need someone‚Äôs opinion, thank you for reading.(Sorry for misguided title)\",\n",

       " \"AITA for telling my girlfriend's sister to stay out of our relationship - This is an ongoing situation, but her sister only got involved last night and I'm mainly asking about my conflict with her. I already posted about everything going on with my girlfriend in another sub and got judgement for that, but I'll give the necessary details for context. \\n\\nBasically, I treated my girlfriend kind of poorly throughout our relationship in the sense that I withheld information from her pertaining to our sex life. I originally was attracted to her because of her resemblance to a celebrity, fantasized about that celebrity during sex, and convinced her to change her hair to look more like that celebrity. I recognize it was manipulative and have committed to changing. She is aware now and forgave me, we are not breaking up over it.\\n\\nHowever, she told her older sister about it at some point last night, and now she (sister) is not letting it go. She made my girlfriend put me on the phone and was incredibly rude, telling me I'm an awful boyfriend and she's not going to let her sister stay with me, she'll get their parents involved, etc. I hung up on her mid-sentence and my girlfriend apologized, but she messaged me on Facebook this morning saying some more choice words and apparently she's coming up here (her and their family live in Mexico, we are in the States and I am American). I told her she has no business doing that and she needs to stay out of our relationship because my girlfriend is an adult and can make her own choices, but she seems to still view her as a child (gf is 21). I wasn't very respectful to the sister, I'll admit, but she basically gave me no benefit of the doubt and immediately got hateful with me. \\n\\nI also just get the impression her family has never approved of our relationship. For one, I am Jewish and my girlfriend started converting back in July. Her family was not happy about this at all as they're Catholics. They say she's making a mistake and that we haven't been together long enough for her to make that kind of decision (together a little under 1 year as of now), but it's not even like I convinced her to do it. She asked to go to services with me and decided to convert on her own. She was agnostic before that.\\n\\nI personally think that detail is the actual reason her sister is looking for an excuse to break us up, but I can admit the way I handled her attacks may have made me look like an asshole.

My brother's girlfriend, just sleep, scroll on her phone and just eat in our house. While I clean, cook and wash dishes, even washing my brother's girlfriend empty plates. \\n\\nHonestly, I'm uncomfortable with having someone around especially a stranger and my brother's girlfriend is still a stranger for me.

I'm just frustrated because, the house, the home I've grown up to now feels like I don't belong anymore.. All I want is a moment of peace where I could enjoy my dayoff..

       " 'WIBTA for denying offer to walk father &amp; his gfs 2 dogs? - WIBTA for not agreeing to walk their dogs everyday for 2 weeks and rejecting this \"offer\"?\\nWe all have full time jobs\\n\\nBackstory: I was informed last night my father and his gf will be going on another vacation soon, so the dogs will need to be walked, etc (dogs aged 2 &amp; 1). this tension began when they got their first dog 2 years ago and my bf and I ended up doing a lot to make sure their puppy wasn\\'t stuck in a kennel all day, with their feces, while they worked. it\\'s obviously tricky to get weeks/months off manage the puppy phase, but we also have full time jobs. Most days, my bf and I leave the house after them and most times one of us would be home prior to them (due to their commute). This in turn lead us to being the ones to deal with whatever the dog (and now dogs) have left during the day. We ended up stopping after the 2nd dog puppy phase repeated itself. I even spoke to them and explained prior that I do not want to help in naming or picking out your dog so I have no attachments and that these dogs are yours as a couple, just because we live around them does not mean they are our dogs too. They got very offended by this but I was trying to warr them that we will no longer be subjecting ourselves and our time to clean up and take care of their dogs.\\n\\nThey realized a lot recently since we stopped picking up\\nafter their 2nd puppy. We overheard them angrily cleaning up, and they mentioned \"i think we are cleaning up more now since (me &amp; bf) were cleaning it up before\". We couldnt help but feel guilty leaving messes like that but we felt it was the only way to finally have them stop depending on us. We give them a heads up now and clean up occasionally. They just are not appreciative, but I do not beleive this is something to be expected of when a couple goes out together to get dogs\\n\\nCurrent Situation: when i was informed of this upcoming vacation, they decided to throw money values in; no rent from either of us for the month. It\\'s a pretty decent deal. We would have to walk them everyday, feed, let outside (one is stillin a crate all day since neither are trained &amp; have very sensitive stomachs for big dogs), and etc. They paid for a dog walker the last one of 5 trips (this would be cheaper than us not paying). My bf and I do not want to agree to this. We understand it\\'s convenient for them, and maybe it\\'s not all that bad. Regardless, we feel wronged and that we cannot escape this unless we move out (we are actively looking and saving, ive had medical issues\\nthat prevented me from working and driving so i started from scratch again last year). I feel we should be able to say no, we basically dont want to walk them everyday for 2 weeks in Decemeber (Canada decemeber). We will still do all the basic necessities, we already do that uncompisated because we genuinely care about both dogs well beings.

When we arrived, we started taking some drinks. I know my limits when it comes to alcohol, but I've drank a little more than usual, which resulted on me having to take a break for a while to recover myself. I told my friends I was going on the second floor to have a sit and I'd be back soon. When I got there, I was slowly losing my mind and passed out at the seat. I was unconscious for 3 whole hours (I know it was unresponsible of me to drink so much, but in my defense, there was other parties that I've drank more, and didn't got that bad [my friend that vanished thinks that as well, cuz he also didn't drank much passed out too. He thinks someone put something at our drinks]).\\n\\nWhen I woke up, the party was already at the end and I took my phone to see what happened. 4 missed calls of my friends and a lot of messages. I called them back and told them what happened and asked where was they. They said they tried to find me and other friend of us (they thought we were kissing somewhere cause we vanished by the same time), and they were now 3 miles away, walking to the bus station to go home. I was so confused, and asked what about the other friend, and they didn't knew. I had almost no battery and had to run those 3 miles to find them, 5AM during rain, with only a t-shirt and shorts (it was cold asf).

I convinced they to get back to the party's place to try finding him. It took hours to find him and eventually we went to the police station to communicate his vanish).

The party's organization released yesterday that around 2000 people was there that night.

I have one that shows how much people was there). Although it was full of people, there was ONLY ONE place that had chairs.

I spent this past weekend at an event that centers around a ball put on on the last night we spend there. I danced with multiple people, but primarily with a friend (30s f) I've known for several years. Neither of us had a dance partner so we spent most of it dancing together. I was showing my girlfriend photos of the event and she got quite upset that the bulk of them were with my friend. I would have danced with my girlfriend if she was there, I invited her to come, and did my best to talk it up to her. I'm pretty annoyed she's upset with me, and she's pissed off because I danced with another woman. AITA?\",\n",

I want to make it clear what was said and how this impacted mine and rebeccas Christmas.\\nAfter returning home from the hippodrome in great festive spirits. That evening the conversation went as follows:\\nYou said 'John got an ear infection' I said 'it's probably not an infection'\\nYou said 'you really are thick as fuck aren't you, no wonder you have no friends'\\nNow I can't comprehend why a mother would say this to their daughter, especially when your granddaughter was in the flat and heard the conversation.\\nI know you have told Jane that you 'honestly can't remember saying that',\\nHowever, I'm not convinced by this standpoint you re making. I think saying 'you can't remember' is an excuse to hide from responsibility, avoid judgement from family members, and dissolve yourself from taking accountability.\\nAnd if in all honesty, you can't remember saying that, then that is a major concern, and something ! would urge you speak to a professional about. Perhaps you have bouts of rage that you're unable to control and this is a symptom of a bigger problem, such as an issue with your mental health - I will elaborate on this later in the letter.\\nOn this Christmas you also offered judgement onto John.

We‚Äôll call her M.\\n(I am using the video M recorded to recount the evening as I was very drunk and do not remember most of the night.)\\n M was recording on my phone all of us dancing and hanging out in the garage and M came over to me and while recording and tried to kiss me and I moved away, she attempted a second time and I once again moved away, she attempted a third time and we ended up kissing( it was the type of drunk pecs girls give to their friends that I‚Äôm pretty sure every single girl has done) and I immediately walked away to stand with my husband. The next morning I have completely forgotten about the incident and my husband decides he wants to watch all of the videos from the night before, as we were scrolling through we came across the video and my memory instantly came back and I told him I didn‚Äôt want to watch the video because it was embarrassing, I ended up deleting the video (I know, bad choice) my husband asked me if I deleted it, at first I said no but then came clean as to what I believed to be on the video. I told him that I deleted it because I was embarrassed and panicked, he ended up going outside and ultimately ended up leaving. When I noticed he was gone I called to see where he went and he said he went for a drive and was talking to his sister, I told him he should come back so we can talk about the situation and he agreed. Here‚Äôs where I think I went wrong, we agreed that prior to this we incident we had never set the boundary of me kissing other girls (which I haven‚Äôt done since we have been together) but he asked me how I would label it and I told him that to me any action you feel the need to hide from your S.O is considered cheating.

       " 'AITA for getting my ex-wife and children uninvited from a Halloween party? - So my (37m) ex-wife (35f) have been divorced for six years and have two kids together under 10. The divorce was not unusual but a pattern emerged during that time where it seemed like my ex would try to intrude into my business whenever possible. Her boundaries are not good, or rather, her willingness to respect my boundaries. Some limited examples include: I kept the home, but even after moving across the city she felt entitled to enter my home whenever she wanted, she created fake social media accounts to try and keep tabs on me, and freaked out on me several times when I started dating, despite being in a relationship with her affair partner. As a result, I decided to do everything I could to avoid any crossover in our lives other than the children. I stopped talking to mutual friends, and built my own network of friends that she doesn‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs been great for my mental health. Many of my friends live in my neighborhood but my ex didn‚Äôt know them when she lived here. She has interacted with them briefly at school events because my kids are friends with their kids as well. When my friends have asked about her, I keep the information limited, and not share the extent to which she made my life difficult during our marriage. \\n\\nSo, recently my ex took my oldest to a birthday party for one of my friends‚Äô kids. Apparently during that party the moms were talking about our Halloween party coming up around my ex. I don‚Äôt have my kids this year but I go every year. According to my ex, she was invited to bring the kids, and according to my friends, she invited herself via text after the birthday party. The truth is probably somewhere in between. Nonetheless, two of the wives told me about it the next time I saw them, literally hours after seeing my ex at an event for our kids. They were apologetic and said they weren‚Äôt sure how it happened and were asking if I was okay with that. I told them that I need her to not be there and that I‚Äôd offer to have the kids and bring them to the party if she wanted. My friends were understanding and said they‚Äôd support me however I needed. I told them I‚Äôd make it about me, not them. Not surprisingly, my ex didn‚Äôt go for it and was insistent that she was going. This led to a contentious back and forth where she accused me of trying to control her, demanding that if I wanted her to not come I needed to call her (where she usually tries to steamroll me), and claiming that I was violating her boundaries by talking about her with my friends. She‚Äôs also insistent that she‚Äôs allowed to be friends with anyone she wants, and I can‚Äôt stop her from being friend with these people.\\n\\nI finally ended it by telling her that she had been uninvited and I was the one communicating it on behalf of my friends. She then told my kids that I uninvited her from the party and they were mad at me for a few days. So, AITA?',\n",

So context myself (M26) and my wonderful fianc√© (F25) are getting married next summer in her hometown. We‚Äôre both genuinely very excited but have run into a ton of struggle over the guest list.

Add in family friends on both sides and we‚Äôre easily looking at a guest list north of 200. For a long time though, my parents personally have been pushing very hard for me to invite my dad‚Äôs cousins and their families. For context I‚Äôve already included his immediate family, cousins, and college friends and a couple of their families (20 additional people) already, but these are people who my fianc√© and I genuinely enjoy.\\n\\nThe issue I‚Äôve struggled with here is that my dad‚Äôs cousins are a mess and I‚Äôve only seen them once in the past 7 or 8 years.

Additionally, my finance‚Äôs mom also wanted to invite cousins but accepted my fianc√©‚Äôs answer when she said no due to the size of the guests and that she didn‚Äôt know them super well.\\n\\nI‚Äôve gone back and forth on the issue for months but In an attempt to sort of appease everyone I recently told my parents that we would be inviting only a few of his cousins (who we actually know to some extent or have seen in recent years) and that we weren‚Äôt inviting the others as I haven‚Äôt known them since I was a kid. Essentially my dad blew up at me, basically asking how I could put him in such an awkward position given the nature of his family and how they will blame him for me not inviting them.

       " 'AITA if I end my relationship because of a cat?  - So long story short, \\nI‚Äôve been dating my bf for about 10 months now. He moved in around 6 months because he was basically here every night. He has this super adorable cat that he eventually brought over from his moms. Cat and my dog are doing well coexisting and I really do love this cat, i got him a cat tree right in the living room next to my desk, I feed him breakfast and dinner most days, I buy him cat toys, I even gave up my whole spare bedroom for him because thats where he eats and that‚Äôs where his litter box is. \\nBut that‚Äôs where the problem comes in. I absolutely HATE the smell of the litter box. My boyfriend tries to clean it daily but often falls behind leaving my whole house smelling like a litter box. I have tried changing litter types but haven‚Äôt found a good one and my bf has got upset that I did this without talking to him about it first. I didn‚Äôt think litter type mattered that much but he is very protective of this cat and has anxiety around its health. \\nThe biggest problem of all though is that this cat is a male and was never fixed. We think he is around 5 years old based on when my bf got him and this cat was essentially a street cat before he took him in. The cat sprays and ‚Äúmarks his territory‚Äù in several spots in my house and it makes me very upset. It is frankly disgusting and the smell is so strong and hard to get out of things. This cat has sprayed on things from my furniture, power strips, my fucking air fryer, can‚Äôt leave shoes on the ground, it is very frustrating. When my bf first moved the cat in we agreed we would get him fixed in hopes of it cutting down on the spraying. Now he is going back on his word and is saying the cat is ‚Äútoo old‚Äù to get fixed and is worried something will go wrong in surgery or that he won‚Äôt have the same personality after. And he refuses to let the cat out because he fights other cats and he‚Äôs worried it will get hit by a car(even though it survied it‚Äôs kitten days as a stray on a very busy road). I am at my witts end here. I love animals and really do love this cat but I really dont think I can be happy the next 10-15 years if my house keeps smelling like a giant cat piss litter box. Am I the asshole here? I don‚Äôt see another solution besides ending the relationship if bf doesn‚Äôt want to get the cat fixed or make him an outdoor cat. \\n\\n\\ntldr: litter box smells and cat sprays. Bf refuses to get him fixed or let him out/doesn‚Äôt clean box enough. ',\n",

Adrien insisted that I take it down, and that he wouldn\\'t allow me to keep it on.\\n\\nI was absolutely taken aback, and told him that was ridiculous since it was my phone and I just used the filter and never pretended to be colourblind or anything. Adrien snapped at me, telling me that I was stupid and out of touch, and that I had no idea what I was doing. I then told Adrien that he was being incredibly rude and controlling, and that what I do with my phone colour settings is none of his business. \\n\\nHe has refused to talk to me ever since, and I\\'m so confused why we\\'re having an argument about colour filters.

My father moved in another appartment. When I came back from my trip, my father told me he was now with another woman.

       " 'AITA For getting kicked out of my parents house? - So this sort of begins when I was a teenager, I got my drivers permit at 16 but I wasn‚Äôt allowed to get my license because my grades were not what my parents wanted. If I couldn‚Äôt keep my grades up then it did not reflect the responsibility I needed to be able to drive alone. I turned 18 at the height of COVID so drivers tests were limited and my family was not going in public, especially crowded areas very often. After everything died down, I got a job at my younger siblings school but I still relied on my father for transportation which I hated because I just wanted to be independent. Finally, I got another job, which was out of the way and was full time, which required my dad to do a lot of running around. Finally, at 21, I got my drivers license. I also did not have a credit score, so financing a car was not in the cards for me. Instead, my dad got himself a truck and I took over the payments on the car he already owned. Fast forward a year later and the car starts having problems which my dad knew about. I told him that it was making horrible sounds and wasn‚Äôt running well. One day on my way home from work it got so bad I was worried about breaking down. He said ‚Äúhopefully you make it to work tomorrow‚Äù to which my friend that I worked with offered to pick me up that night so I could go to work with her in the morning. Being me, I had to prove a point and I drove to work the next morning and shocking no one, I broke down on a busy road during rush hour. After taking the car to the mechanic it was going to cost over $5000 to fix    My parents wanted me to pay all of it, but I didn‚Äôt just have $5000 laying around. I worked at a smaller, family owned business and I was pretty close with the owner. Due to so much stress I ended up in her office talking about how stressed I was and she offered to help with the car. But once I told her the whole situation (how much was still left on the loan, the cars mileage, and how much repairs will cost) she said she‚Äôd rather loan me money to buy a car in my name that will last me years. When I brought this idea up to my parents they obviously got upset and we got in an argument. I already knew they‚Äôd be mad, my friends mom had already offered to let me stay with them, my boyfriend stayed outside while I talked to them. We got in a huge argument, which I think they were upset that I had a plan if they were to kick me out. They also say I was lying to everyone around me and that I was making them look bad because I was telling people around me the situation I was in. That all happened in August and I haven‚Äôt really spoken to them since. My younger sister and cousin sent me incredibly rude messages, my sister also sent my friend messages out of anger. I feel so guilty but I was doing so much as the oldest sibling, being in school and working full time. I kind of felt stuck and I did not want to be paying for that car for the next 4 years. So AITA for getting kicked out? ',\n",

So it is a treat when he is home and we try to plan fun family activities together during those trips home. we don‚Äôt usually get a lot of notice when he will be coming home. To air some grievances (relative to the main point) we have seprt bank accts and split bills, I do not receive any $from him, I run the day2day household/kids/pets expenses on my own paycheck, food, gas, school events, bdays, doc appts (you get it)‚Ä¶ for his 40th I threw an elaborate surprise party and got his family to help make it happen, it was awesome, but bc it was held at the *cool* aunt‚Äôs house he assumes she threw the party, hubs doesn‚Äôt give me credit.

He didnt reply so i asked again if i could just do this last toe because otherwise it will scratch me, to which he replied ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôll just scratch you then.\" At this point I was starting to get pretty mad because if he did this when I asked, or better without being asked we wouldn‚Äôt have a problem to being with. \\n\\nThe argument continued to escalate, he kept going on about how I didn‚Äôt believe that I hurt him even though I apologised when it happened, I was just trying to make it clear that if he hadn‚Äôt been jerking his foot the way a puppy jerks their paw when getting their nails clipped, I wouldn‚Äôt have cut too low for a second time. I‚Äôll admit I did feel a bit like he was overreacting, and the only reason he wouldn‚Äôt let me just file the nail and finish the job was to be spiteful. \\n\\nAt that point we started arguing about a whole bunch of other stuff as well, and now I feel like shit, I feel like I overstepped and was being irrational. \\n\\nTLDR I cut my bfs toenail too short because he kept jerking him foot, and he got really mad at me. \\n\\nAITA?',\n",

For background information I have enjoyed kpop,anime and kdramas since I was in high school because of my parents.

He recently went to a concert with me to watch a kpop group but made comments such as that my outfit is showing off my boobs for them, telling me not to get wet over them and that he is only going with me because he doesn‚Äôt trust me.

       " \"AITA for starting a new relationship three months after breaking up? - I'm 28M, and I had a 26-year-old fianc√©e from another country. We dated long-distance for a year and saw each other twice‚Äîonce she came to here and stayed for a month, and the other time I spent almost three months in her country. Early on, when she visited me, things went well with almost no conflicts. But when I went to her with eight months of dating, I noticed some troubling behaviors:\\n\\n* She yelled at her mom and even told her to shut up;\\n* She would restrict when I could shower depending on her mood;\\n* When I made her breakfast, she simply said, ‚ÄúYou eat it;‚Äù\\n* In a discussion where we were trying to work things out, she went to check social media;\\n* When I gave her flowers, she just had a closed-off expression;\\n* I wanted her to learn my language to better communicate with my family, but she always said she wouldn‚Äôt because she was ‚Äútoo lazy‚Äù;\\n* She gave me the silent treatment.\\n\\nOn top of this, her mom put a lot of pressure on me to propose, to the point where I wasn‚Äôt allowed to discuss our future until I formally asked for her hand. After I returned to Brazil, almost anything caused arguments. She rarely picked up my calls or responded to messages, sometimes going four days without replying and blaming it on me. This affected me deeply, even impacting my work.\\n\\nThese issues happened maybe 10-15% of the time I was with her; most of the time, she was a great person, and I have no complaints in that regard. I just couldn‚Äôt see a future with someone who behaved that way. After I returned to my country, we stayed together for about a month longer, but half that time was spent in conflict.\\n\\nWhen I decided to end things, she promised she would change, but I had already made up my mind. It was tough, but afterward, I felt better, free from the constant anxiety caused by our fights.\\n\\nAfter the breakup, I got closer to someone from our shared social circle here. She was the complete opposite, and as we talked regularly, we started going out, and now we‚Äôve been dating for a short time.\\n\\nSo far, things have been great. I was completely transparent with her about the risk she was taking in dating someone so soon after a breakup, and she was fine with it.\\n\\nP.S.: I always like to emphasize that this is just my perspective.

       " 'AITA for snitching on my best friend? - Me and \"Mary\" (female, mid twenties) have been best friends for 6 years. We met in college  and I  consider her my one and only best friend. At that time Mary had a new boyfriend. I never liked that guy. At first he was good to her so I couldn\\'t voice any criticism, after 3 years he moved out with her and his behavior changed. He was manipulative, took advantage of her free labor, overly jealous, verbally abused her and went to clubs, took pictures with dancers and posted them on instagram. I encouraged her to break up with him, and she actually did. She told me she was over him, But I never believed her because I knew how much she liked him, but I trusted her. After a while, she went on dating apps to look for a boyfriend but she met a girl. She wanted to befriend her, but the girl had different intentions. She was a lesbian and wanted to get to know her better in hopes of dating her. One thing led to another and they start dating. They looked very happy, and the girl is madly in love with Mary. I\\'ve never thought of Mary as a bisexual, but she started complimenting girls more frequently after she got in a relationship so I believed her. After a while, she started complaining about how her gf was \"not mature\" and how her taking the lead all the time is tiring and how it‚Äôs taking a toll on her, but I explained that her gf is pretty young and not experienced so that was to be expected. Moving forward to a couple months ago, ex bf was back in town and he already started stalking Mary at her job. I told her to ask him to leave or to get someone else to talk to him but she said she couldn\\'t do it. I started getting suspicious but I gave her the benefit of the doubt, \"Mary would never betray her gf like that\". How foolish of me. I was leaving town at that time so I was pretty busy, and we didn\\'t have time to talk, but she confessed to a freind that she was back with her ex boyfriend. She also specifically told them to never tell me because she knows I\\'ll be mad at her. She was right, the friend told me and I was very angry but she never told me herself so I acted like I didn\\'t know anything. After I left town, she added me back to her instagram stories and I saw her with him. All I could send her is a \"?\" message and she never replied. I told her that this is unacceptable and she needs to decide between the two of them but she still hadn\\'t done anything about it. Her gf came to our town from abroad just to visit her for 2 weeks, and Mary told me that she will be leaving to her bf\\'s right after her gf left town.

       " 'AITA for suggesting my mother should risk upsetting my stepdad to spend time with me? - I, 25F, recently moved back home into my parents‚Äô house following the breakdown of a long-term relationship and subsequent abusive home situation (but alas that is not the subject of this post). Living in the house is myself, my mother (47F), stepfather (44M) and brother (23M). My mother and stepfather married earlier this year and have been in a relationship for the past few years, so I didn‚Äôt grow up with him around. Despite this, I really like my stepfather and it‚Äôs clear that he adores my mum. My mum was never the sort to date when I was younger, and I was always afraid she would be by herself. \\n\\nWhen I was younger and still living at home, my mum and I used to spend most of our free time together, watching TV shows we liked, playing games and just generally having a lot of fun. My brother was the type to lock himself in his room all day; I didn‚Äôt. \\n\\nSince returning home, hanging out with my parents is monotonous and boring. They have this set routine of watching the same TV shows every single day once they wake up, and if I dare to watch something that my stepdad doesn‚Äôt want to watch, it‚Äôs a huge issue with my mum. She spends all day cuddling with my stepdad on the sofa with her iPad. It‚Äôs not like it was before. I can‚Äôt even talk when they‚Äôre engrossed in their shows. I just get cursed out and told to be quiet.\\n\\nWe had an argument a couple of days ago when I wanted to show her a quick 3 minute YouTube video. I knew there was no chance that she would watch it when she was in her routine, so I waited until my parents had gotten ready for work (they work together) and would be leaving in 10 minutes or so. My stepdad was still getting ready and my mum had come into the lounge, so I suggested watching this video. Her exact response was ‚ÄúDo I have to?‚Äù and I completely lost my shit. I‚Äôd said something like she didn‚Äôt have to but I was only asking for 3 minutes of her life. It led onto me getting upset over her insistence on spending every waking moment with her husband and ignoring my existence entirely, and she responded that he was her husband and she should be spending her day with him. I answered that he may be her husband but I am her daughter. I asked for her to do some of the things we used to like doing when he‚Äôs in as well, watch an episode of a TV show, play a game for an hour, anything. Maybe he gets a bit upset about it, but I missed the way we used to be. She exclaimed that I was out of line and swiftly left for work with my stepdad as soon as he was ready - he hadn‚Äôt overheard any of the conversation, but no doubt they‚Äôve talked about it. \\n\\nMy real question is, AITA for asking for a disruption to the routine just to do something we like together? Or is their time together their time and I don‚Äôt have a right to impede on it? Should I settle for the few and far between days where he is working and she isn‚Äôt?  Should I get over myself and accept that I‚Äôm not a teenager anymore and our relationship is different now?',\n",

She said she would take him to get what he wanted. So I sent her extra money ontop of the ordered amount. \\n\\nReason I asked for where did the money go was because she has not stated the original amount is not enough nor made a request to increase it. \\n\\nThis counts for living expenses also. If she needs more she can ask I have never not send her extra if it is something our son needs. Though the amount in question does cover rent food clothing other general living expenses. So yeah I will question if she states I need more for food when I just sent her money. Which has happened so our order is fairly detailed in what the money is supposed to be used for. Since she has lied in the past.\\n\\nEdit as per requested I sent an extra 400 over because my son wanted a light saber he saw at gamestop which alone was 235 dollars. She did agree verbally that she would take him and get him the stuff he wanted. I sent her the money on the 1st together with the child support payment. \\n\\n\\n\\nSo my son's mother and I did not work out. I travel 6 to 8 months out the year due to work. His mother has primary custody and I do send the ordered amount and some extra when I can. \\n\\nFast forward to Sunday I am back for the Holidays. I plan to take my son out for Halloween. He wants to be a Jedi, so I showed him my Jedi costume and asked to see the one his mother bought-I did send her extra to get the costume since I knew I would be back before Halloween just was not sure I would be back in time to get him the costume-she told him that's I was going to buy it. \\n\\nI was upset but just played it off and said oh that is right and it was in the mail. Thankfully I found a costume  Yesterday. \\n\\nI did reach out to his mother when I had a moment in private to ask her where did the money I sent go. She told me that I have no right to question what she does with the money. Our child's needs are being met and that is all that matters. She has primary custody and gets majority say. I told her that the money was meant for our child not her. \\n\\nShe was not awarded spousal support. This is where I am getting mixed messages and where I wish to know if what I said made me the asshole. \\n\\nMy mom said I was being the prick by questioning how she was raising our child when I am not around. I do not think I questioning her parenting but I did question how she used the money I sent. She said she would get him the costume. \\n\\nIf she needed extra for something that is related to him I will always send extra. Yes, early on I was more accommodating.

He will say the most personal things in the worst situations, some of which could get himself or others hurt, and it's like he doesn't know when to stop. \\n\\nTypically, the things he talks about are more on the controversial side. Important context, the both of us are trans men living in the deep south. I, naturally, to stay safe, am so deep in the closet that I couldn't claw my way out if I wanted to. He isn't. I understand being out, and believe me, I want to more than anything, but I just don't believe it's safe for me. I'm glad he feels safe, but I worry for him so much.

Then I saw that look in his eyes that he was about to bring me into this, he was gonna mention something about My gender or sexuality.\\n\\nUsually, I'm able to change the topic pretty quickly whenever he gets like this, but not today.

When we got there, I told him to shut the fuck up, that he was walking a mighty fine line, and that he was putting us both in danger.\\n\\nHe gave me this weird look and told me to quit being an asshole, said he could talk about whatever he wanted, and that nothing was gonna happen to either of us.\\n\\nAnother tidbit of important information, one of my very close friends was murdered 2 years ago. I'm not saying it's because she was a trans woman, but I can't prove it wasn't. Trans people in my town are not fucking treated well. I had a friend that was out, publicly.

I called them and asked to change it, but they said the request has to come from the owner.  So I am back to square one.\\n\\nMeanwhile, we recently started to get visits from the sheriff and process servers trying to \"serve\" lawsuit papers.  The first time the sheriff showed up, it was stressful.  The last straw was that a process server showed up when only my 13yo son was home and he was very aggressive with my kid.  That motivated me to try to track down the principal of AptCo.  It turns out he belongs to same golf club that my recently moved-here inlaws joined (really only fancy one in the area), and they got me his email.  I emailed him asking him to change the addresses and I heard nothing back from him.  I asked my inlaws to try to maybe find him at the club and buttonhole him.  They did and he said basically \"have them email my assistant\", which I did, and again got no response.\\n\\nHere\\'s where I may be the AH.  I made a plan for the next time a process server might show up.  I asked my inlaws, is he a member of any regular golf game or activity?  And indeed, there is a men\\'s group that he is a part of.  The next time process-server showed up (a few weeks ago), I told him this was wrong address, but that he could for sure find the principal of AptCo at XYZ County Club at 2pm any Tuesday.   The next Tuesday, the principal was embarrassed by getting served in front of all his friends at the golf club.  My inlaws said it was the talk of the club.  Then I posted disingenuously to NextDoor, \"hey, anybody here know how to reach Mr. X of AptCo?  He must be quite a slumlord, as my address is mistakenly down as registered address for some of his entities and I am getting process servers showing up constantly!  Would appreciate any leads, and obviously if you are in the market to rent, probably consider avoiding AptCo.\"\\n\\nWell, suddenly Mr. X was willing to call me back!  He screamed at me for embarrassing him and said I was an asshole for not finding another way to address the issue.  So, did I go too far?    \\n\\n',\n",

Even though stuff was all closed and we were meant to stay home, they threw a huge gender reveal because they had always wanted a girl and wanted to celebrate the fact they were getting a girl with everyone they knew. My parents took video of their reaction and one they posted to their socials at the time. It was of them screaming and crying and cheering that they *had their dream come true, getting the child they always dreamed of, the daughter they had always wanted and how they couldn\\'t wait to be parents*. The video got taken down after mom\\'s sister told her she had no idea how lucky she was to have a healthy child and went no contact with my parents (she and her husband had fertility trouble and couldn\\'t have kids).\\n\\nBut I knew from a really early age I disappointed my parents by being a boy. Looking at photos and videos of them before me vs after me, you can see the joy fade. They were told I was a girl. Had clothes, a nursery and everything set up for a girl. They even had a name picked out for girl me. Then I was born a boy. The only \"family photos\" of us I have is from the first couple of weeks of my life. They never bothered to take any with me afterward. There are photos of us with extended family but like just me and them over the 12 years of my life? Nah. And even now they have so many taken with the girl of their dreams they finally had but I\\'m not in any of them. I also found out through extended family that another family member named me because they didn\\'t want to think of boys names they were so disappointed.\\n\\nI basically live with them as a distant roommate. We don\\'t eat together or do anything together. Mostly that works for me. My boyfriend (16) was my best friend before we started going out and his family were always more like my family.\\n\\nI was at his grandparents house to celebrate their wedding anniversary with the family and talk of my parents came up and everyone kinda knows how shitty they are but not really. So I told them about the video and some of my boyfriends family were struggling to believe they\\'d post it. I showed them a screenshot I had of the video on my mom\\'s account and then showed the video. They were really upset by the reaction. Everyone said it was like they were first time parents and his grandma got kinda teary thinking of me being there at the time watching it.\\n\\nMy parents found out because my boyfriends mom basically told my mom how awful she was.

Lisa and I met as we lived near each other time and we had both just moved in. We only got really close when our friendgroup broke up and Lisa, who was the closest to my age, just stayed with me. From young, Lisa had always been a girl that was constantly in relationships, getting a new boyfriend every few months. Obviously, I wasn‚Äôt too happy about it because all of Lisa‚Äôs boyfriends turned out to be complete a-holes. But the thing is, I found it odd how she‚Äôd cry everyday after breaking up and then immediately find a new boyfriend.\\n\\nAs time went on, Lisa started dating guys that were much older than her and honestly, it irked me. I mean, what kind of decent guy would go for a kid? So I tried to talk her out of it, to tell her just how wrong it was. Lisa hated that tho. We‚Äôd get into big fights because she kept saying i was being too judgy when it wasn‚Äôt even my life but all I was trying to do was to ensure that she‚Äôll be safe so her dismissing my concern like that made me feel like she didn‚Äôt even care about me. Every time she got a new boyfriend, she‚Äôd neglect our friendship. And even if we did hang out, all she‚Äôd do is rant and complain. If tell her that older guys are just taking advantage of her, she‚Äôd get mad at me and the cycle would continue. We only made up because she‚Äôd pretend that nothing happened and I just accepted that because I didn‚Äôt want to lose my best friend.\\n\\nThat went on for years, progressively getting worse and I just gave up. I stopped caring. I knew all about her and her life but she knew nothing about mine. I felt more like a therapist to her than a friend. I was so sick and tired of her ranting about the same exact thing. She‚Äôd ask me for advice, I‚Äôd give her advice, she‚Äôd continue ranting as if she never heard my advice and then it‚Äôll end of by her asking me what she should do when I‚Äôve already told her. I realised she never wanted to listen, she just wanted a punching bag. She‚Äôd ask to call for 5 minutes but the calls would end up taking hours because she‚Äôd repeat the same thing over and over again.\\n\\nI don‚Äôt see a point arguing with her anymore, especially since she‚Äôll never listen to what i have to say. So I decided to simply ignore her. If she texts, I‚Äôd reply after hours, days even weeks. If she called i‚Äôd pretend I didn‚Äôt notice it.

We‚Äôve been together for around 5 years. Early on, she covered rent, and I handled food. For about 2 years, we earned roughly the same and split family expenses (it was just the two of us then). She found out she was pregnant in March 2023, and in September, her employer didn‚Äôt renew her contract, so she went on unemployment benefits.

I do smoke, but it‚Äôs not daily, and I‚Äôm actively reducing my own use, especially since our child was born. She, on the other hand, is using harder substances and has increased her usage. I know it‚Äôs not ideal for me to use at all, but I‚Äôm working to cut back and shift my focus to what‚Äôs best for our child.\\n\\nEDIT2 : I want to sincerely apologize if I offended anyone with my post. I recognize that my focus was misplaced, and I‚Äôm waking up late to the reality of our situation. It‚Äôs clear that I need to act quickly to ensure my child‚Äôs safety, and I appreciate the urgency of these concerns.

He said he doesn‚Äôt care if the men are married, gay, bisexual or asexual he is not happy with the arrangement. I argued that my brother is present, and the other is married and will be sharing a room with his wife (one of my best friends) and the other is significantly younger than me. He is aware that I hang out with these people very often however he argues that even if I have known these men my whole life and have formed friendships with them they could still be a danger to me and I should therefore either cancel the trip or find another accommodation.

I again recommended getting flights before she no longer had a income. Instead, she got a kitten.\\n\\nI sent her a message a few weeks before the event checking on her travel plans. She still hadn't bought flights &amp; was conflicted about attending because of her kitten.\\n\\nIt comes to the week of &amp; I'd been calling her daily to see if she'd made a decision. Its only TWO DAYS before the start of the festival that she conclusively says she won't be attending. She also specifically said, ‚ÄúDo you have anyone that would take my ticket?‚Äù\\n\\nUnfortunately, no one else in my life enjoys this genre of music. I also am not safely able to attend a 3 day festival solo due to serious medical conditions.\\n\\nOnce she said she wasn't coming, I immediately listed both our tickets on the official resale website, as well as, 2 other resale sites. The festival was sold out, so I was hopeful that they would be sold but unfortunately there were hundreds of other tickets up for sale. I even saw some listed for as low as $67. I had exactly 1 enquiry about the tickets, which lead nowhere.\\n\\nRegardless, I waited until the Thursday night before I packed my campervan and got ready for the festival &amp; still even left the tickets up until we were driving to the festival. I managed to convince my bf to come with me, despite him disliking the genre immensely.\\n\\nAfter the festival, my friend asked me when I was going to pay her for the ticket.\\n\\nHer argument is that my bf used the ticket so either him or I should pay. My counter argument was that:\\n\\n1 She bailed last minute.\\n\\n2. I tried to sell the tickets but they didn't sell.\\n\\n3. She knew it wasn't safe for me to attend solo, leaving me the options of waste both tickets or pay for both, which I can't afford.\\n\\n4. She had said to me ‚ÄúDo you have anyone that can take my ticket‚Äù which to me meant the ticket was on offer for anyone available to go with me.\\n\\n5. I don't believe my bf should have to pay either as he was attending only as a favour to me.\\n\\nEveryone I've spoken to agree I'm in the right. She said that she spoke to people that believe that I should pay the full amount of the ticket, but I wonder if she actually provided the full story. She did not reply to my last two messages, &amp; this has been weighing on me so I thought I‚Äôd get the opinion of some internet strangers before I attempt to reach out again lol. There's more context/info but kept short for post limit!\\n\\nSo, tell me reddit, AITA for not paying her for the ticket?\\n\\n  \\nEDIT: To add further context, the same situation happened in reverse in 2022. I had tickets to an event in her city but came down with COVID 2 days before and wasn't able to travel. I gave her the ticket with absolutely no want or expectation of reimbursement because I wasn't able to make it!\",\n",

My mother also would never be able to survive a real job because she goes off the handle if you even imply she is incorrect in any way. I (20 F )am a college student, work part-time, do after-school activities for my degree and I do not eat at home due to lack of food, as my parents spend money on junk food instead. I stopped giving money for food as it was not used to buy meals. during the summer I have been staying at my grandmother\\'s house where I can eat my food so I buy my own there and help with chores. My parents berate me for not contributing financially or doing chores at home, despite my absence for several months. I tried to explain to them that I could not afford to support the family (parents and 3 siblings) and my own needs. I also know it\\'s not really about the chores because I was never taught by my mother \"her way of doing them\" because of my mother\\'s OCD. We physically aren\\'t allowed to do the chores. but that\\'s a problem because my mom doesn\\'t do them either even though she is \"the only one who can do it right\" and a SAHM.\\n\\nMy parents also manipulated my aging grandmother into giving them the savings my late grandpa and she saved for me, arguing that I would \"waste it\" even though I only mentioned using it for a house and a wedding. I don\\'t even know which bank it\\'s in I think this and their demanding money for food I don\\'t even eat shows their true intentions. Luckily I also have my savings but is much less them what I was told was in that account.\\n\\nTonight, they got angry when I spent $20 on candy to give to trick-or-treaters with my Boyfriend, Halloween is a holiday my boyfriend and I love because we go all out with spooky displays and costumes. They demanded the money or my help in handing out candy this year (they don\\'t have candy so idk what they are talking about) because they didn\\'t want to do it. They called me names and threatened eviction, on top of other abusive behavior.

       " \"AITA for standing up for my Mom n sister against my husband and in laws? - I come from a family of 3 including my mom and my little sis. I lost my Dad when I was 10 and my mom single handedly did her very best to make everything seem as if Dad were still around.She never had support from relatives and obviously made countless sacrifices as we were growing up.\\n\\nI got married in 2022 and moved to NZ.As soon as we got married, my in laws spun into action by making me convert all my bank accounts into joint accounts with my husband. At the time, their reason was that it would be beneficial for my move to NZ. I constantly turned a blind eye giving them the benefit of the doubt.\\n\\nEnter husband. The red flags started popping up immediately after our wedding. His total lack of compassion is mind boggling. I used to tell myself maybe he's just shy. I used to get depressed constantly, but I told myself that I'm stuck with this now and maybe I'm the one who needs an attitude change.\\n\\nSo the latest issue began when my mom told me over the phone that she would really like to visit Turkey with one of her friends. My husband who was attending the call with me just stormed off, making the whole thing really odd. He then started arguing with me that I should make her understand that going on expensive international trips at this time is a bad idea, she should be saving money for my sister when she needs to get married. Truth be told, even I thought it was a bad idea at the time since mom just travelled to Singapore this year. But I brushed off his concerns saying that even if I am to object, she wouldn't listen to me and would end up in an argument. Besides, the trip wasn't confirmed at all. We ended up not speaking that whole weekend. I finally lost it and started pushing his buttons to know why exactly he's so concerned about this and ultimately it slipped from his mouth - He doesn't want my Mom to approach us for money after she spends all of hers. I told him it's none of his business what my mom chooses to do with her money and she's never approached us for help. Even if she does, it's my responsibility and I will not abandon my family. My Mom's getting older and has the fomo about not being able to travel and see beautiful places. Things escalated pretty quickly after that and my in laws got involved. I work a good job and is single handedly putting my husband through college. If I ever mention even in the slightest way about me being the breadwinner, they turn the whole thing against me.This is the first time I raised my voice against them because I understood that they really look down on me and my family.Everything's come crashing down on me to a point that even the things I do on a daily basis while maintaining a busy schedule are at fault. It seems like they want me to cast out my side of the family completely.   I'm not totally a saint here. I should have controlled my emotions better. But I expect any good human being to stand up for their family when they are being treated wrongly.\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n\\nEdit: I couldn't fit everything in the original post. The main reason I asked whether I'm the asshole is because I lost my temper at my husband and in laws. I became really violent and was screaming and shouting because I wasn't being heard at all. I knew he was pushing my buttons to get me to react but I fall for it all the time. At one point I even raised my hand to slap him when he talked shit about my Mom. On top of all this, because he's studying social practice, he thinks he can armchair diagnose anyone with mental disorders. Recently he's started accusing me of being bipolar since I get very angry at times but very loving the rest of the time. I'm sorry but I thought human beings are supposed to have different emotions. How can he even accuse the person putting him through college of having a mental illness? \\nI see all of your comments about leaving him. It's much more easier than done. It'll ruin me and my family. Where I come from, divorce is very much frowned upon. Which is why I wanna give my husband and IL to change their attitude. It doesn't mean I'm gonna say goodbye to my self respect. I'm actually in the process of starting my own bank account. I have really good reasons now to make this change and if they question my decision, I can point it back to their poor decisions to hurt me. Their self righteousness isn't gonna allow them to accept it though. I appreciate all the comments that helped me realize that I should be looking out for myself. As of this edit, my husband and I haven't spoken to each other for almost a week. I will update the results of them coming to know about my separate account. Hopefully it'll be a learning curve and not a deeper hole.\",\n",

About a year ago we found a gal and she was great. Dogs loved her and we used her 2 times. Never had any issues except her cancelling on us twice, two hours before we left for our trips. We get it though, things happen and we didn‚Äôt hold it against her. We just made sure to have my brother as back up in case she cancelled. Anyway, we left for Mexico and we have a ring camera on our front door. She knows this and she‚Äôs also house sitting and spending the night. Not just drop ins. We have three dogs, well behaved but my dogs need to wear wraps on their bellies because they are old and sometimes pee in the house. They are never on longer than a few hours and they are totally comfortable in them. We specified on rover that we would like them taken out every 2-3 hours but if she need to leave, but they can be alone for about 8 hours. At 11pm, we noticed that she left at 10am but never returned. For the record, we aren‚Äôt snooping or spying, we just get notified. So my wife checked and she hadn‚Äôt been back all day. We called her and she said ‚Äúoh I came back at 12 and let them out.‚Äù Two things here, no she didn‚Äôt. There was nothing on the ring so she‚Äôs lying and even if it were true, that‚Äôs still 12 hours of her not letting them out or feeding them. We asked her to leave our house immediately and that we will be contacting rover to make sure she doesn‚Äôt watch dogs again. I genuinely cannot understand leaving dogs for that long.

The last 2 years I have had single dorm rooms due to my social anxiety but I got to know these 3 girls well the past 2 years and even though I was nervous, I thought they\\'d be great to live with. And they were. Until recently. \\nMy school has a thing where seniors aren\\'t allowed to live on campus, we have to get off-campus housing to help us prepare for living on our own, but the school will help us figure out rent and stuff. My roomies haven\\'t talked about it at all but I\\'ve heard enough from others who already have their housing that I decide to be the one to bring it up with them. I want to get a good and affordable apartment early, after all, and people are snatching them up. This is especially important since one of my roomies is from a low-income family. \\n\\nWell, it turns out that they already got an apartment...3 weeks ago. For 3 people, myself not included. When I asked why I wouldn\\'t have been included in this, one of them said \"I thought you already had a place\" which makes no sense because I had not once talked about housing and I also have no other friends in my grade, they\\'re all seniors. \\nWhile I thought I was good friends with these three, they *do* hang out a lot without me - not as intentional exclusion, but they\\'re all morning people who go out for breakfast together every day, while I sleep in and don\\'t eat breakfast. They seem to have all gotten closer to each other during this time, leaving me behind, which isn\\'t any of our faults in and of itself, but I know the housing discussion must have all happened during breakfasts. And they just...never told me or even asked. \\n\\nI have no idea what to do about next year. I can\\'t live with strangers due to my anxiety and if there\\'s no place I can afford I am worried I\\'ll have to transfer schools. I\\'m hoping they can make a disability accommodation for me, my anxiety is an actual disability and is the reason I was guaranteed a single room the past 2 years. \\n\\nThings have been...awkward with my roomies for the past few days and I\\'m starting to feel a lot less comfortable living with them. I\\'d really like to switch rooms when the semester is over and go back to a single dorm like I have had in the past. \\n\\nBut I have two worries about that. If I leave, there are two options.\\n \\n1) the 3 girls\\' housing cost goes up because they still have to pay for a 4-person apartment, and like I said earlier, one is from a low-income family and can already barely afford college. \\n\\n2) they get a new roomie to replace me. one of the other girls is very much like me, with really bad social anxiety and while she has a few other friends in our grade, it\\'s unlikely that she could get one of them and she could also not handle having a random person as a roomie. \\n\\nSo, WIBTA if I switched rooms for the new semester, even if it meant majorly screwing over one of my roomies? \\n',\n",

       " \"AITA for 'calling his family animals' - My partner and I have been living together for about a year. I have a pet who is old but very well behaved and without many accidents around the house. This is probably the last year she'll be around, so I have asked him to please treat her with a lot of love and attention because she is my whole heart. She was an unexpected rescue who had had a hard life before me and I made a promise to give her the best life I can when I found her. I have gone to many extremes for my pet and would make the same decisions every time. I don't have kids or another responsibility like kids in my life, so I don't feel like setting her as my priority in life is wrong, as I am the only person she has. My boyfriend initially accepted this responsibility but he doesn't feel like giving her love and respect is important, just feeding her pretty much. She really loves him though and it breaks my heart to see her try to get his attention, nudge his hand, fall over (bc she old) trying to reach his height, etc, only for him to ignore her. He also eats her favorite snacks in front of her and doesn't share even though the scent has turned her into a hurricane of desire. For this particular kind of pet, these attitudes are really detrimental. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem is that when I see something that is particularly hurtful and hard to watch, I try to tell him about it and since I have no other points of comparison for him since he doesn't love animals, I inevitably fall into a trap of asking him if he would like for me to treat his family the same way. (I.e. Would you like it if I shut the door in your brother's face when he was trying to get my attention or talk to me? How would you feel if you saw your mom falling over a chair just to talk to me and I just ignored her?) This is incredibly offensive to him and he cannot understand my point at all. He thinks I am saying that his family is animals, I guess, but I have a difficult time understanding why he can't understand that I am just trying to put him into my shoes, even though the comparison isn't perfect obviously. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn my opinion, if he told me that an insect was the most important responsibility in his life I would treat it as such. If he told me that a plant was the most important responsibility in his life and that I spend an hour a day blowing my CO2 on it, I would do it. And if he compared me ignoring his plant to ignoring my pet, I wouldn't get offended or say one has nothing to do with the other. I would just do it and understand that he has a certain love for a living thing that I cannot understand, but I would spend the time, dedication and intention that he asked me to. \\r\\n\\r\\nTLDR; Animal loving girlfriend tries to compare boyfriend's empty treatment of her pet to how she would never treat his family.

In the near future we have plans to move in together and we have been talking about how when it finally happens we will get a kitten with each other.

Over the last month or so she has been feeding it and it's becoming more well acquainted with the surroundings. At this point, I can tell that she wants to take in the cat, but I am not really for the idea. I have never had a cat before, so I was excited about starting with a kitten for my first one, she on the other hand has had multiple growing up. Some other information is that there are multiple stray cats in the area, we don't know where the cat came from, it isn't fixed, and has a minor temperament (it hisses a little bit sometimes and swats a little). Just wanted to hear some other opinions on the matter, because my girlfriend's sister and mom seem to think that I should want the cat.\\n\\n  \\nEdit: I worded the post poorly to make it seem like she asked me if I she could take in the cat and I said no, but this was not the case, I ultimately told her that the decision is hers.\",\n",

I wanted to go there since I was like 14. I visited it twice for tours. it was my dream school, and I didn't get in. I was crushed, and still am. I am learning to enjoy the college I do attend, I have met some cool people already, I like my professors, I am certain I will enjoy my four years here; but there's a large piece of me right now that still wishes I was attending the college that I didn't get into. \\n\\nthe rejection was hard to take. Shaun knew it was my top choice, and he did his best to support me when results came out, but I was also very cognizant that I didn't want to take away from his joy and the success he deserves to celebrate, so I mostly hid how upset I was. but I was/am devastated, to lose a dream I had for so long. if I go to concert we'd be staying in a hotel that right off the college campus, which I'm sure we'd end up visiting or doing something in, and honestly I just do not want to visit the college yet. truthfully I am still in my feelings, I am still sad not to be attending. \\n\\nI am thinking of backing out, and trying to come up with an excuse about why I don't want to go (although it will be hard since Shaun already knows I have the weekend free, since I was suppose to be attending the other concert). However, I worry this would be an asshole move, because we have really made a big deal of celebrating each other's birthdays this year, and my absence would make me only guy in the group to miss any birthday event. we also promised that even though Shaun's birthday was once we had all started our new schools, we would still meet up to celebrate him for his birthday ike he did everyone else's before him. but I really don't want to walk on that campus yet.

I am British, she is Australian, we moved Down Under mainly for her to be closer to her family but also because we thought it would be a nicer place to raise a family.

My mother has also flown out here once to be with me and her grandkids.

       " \"AITA For Going Forward with Picking out my GF‚Äôs Ring? - I(24m) and my gf K(22f) have been dating for 3 years. We‚Äôve discussed a future and planned out our timeline of our engagement and marriage. We agreed on our engagement to be before the end of the year. Unfortunately due to both her and I being military and being apart for half the year and only recently returning to our home state in August made things difficult. Fortunately I was able to do the right thing and get her parents blessings and then soon go ring shopping with K‚Äôs mom (D) and sister (A). We went to a big jewelry shop where we‚Äôre able to order the perfect engagement band for K. The ring would take about 2 weeks to get to the store. Last week the ring came in and I asked D and A if we could see the ring together on Saturday 10/25, as K won‚Äôt be home. A was working that day and wouldn‚Äôt be able to go, so it would be just me and D. I thought I had communicated that though I‚Äôd prefer if all three of us could go together, I wouldn‚Äôt mind if it were me and D. However,I found out that D and A didn‚Äôt know we still had planned to go. The miscommunication is my fault and I accept that I should of verified first long before the day in question. D asked if we could reschedule, but I didn‚Äôt want to potentially reschedule and push my plans back another week/month trying to coordinate with 3 different schedules. I have 2 months left to plan something and I imagined I‚Äôd be cutting it pretty close. So with that in mind I respectfully told D that tho I take responsibility for the miscommunication, I really can‚Äôt push my timeline anymore than I already have. Needless to say D was not pleased and told me ‚Äúwhatever, do what you want‚Äù. I backtracked and said I could just look at the band and buy the diamond and ask the jeweler to hold onto them until we all came together during the weekday after work to see it. She then proceeded to tell me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk to you rn‚Äù. So at a loss as to what to do I went forward with my plans. I sent a text message to the both of them apologizing for the miscommunication and the hurt I caused. That I wanted to make it up to them and if there was anything I could do to make things right so we could continue with the remaining plans and make sure K has a wonderful proposal. Her mom responded by telling me, that I hurt their feelings, that even tho they were upset I decided to continue anyway. She said that there‚Äôs no moving forward from this and that I ruined it for her, that it breaks her heart that K probably won‚Äôt have a wonderful memory of her proposal, but that‚Äôs on me because I ruined it and I‚Äôll have to live the rest of my life knowing that. Good luck with the proposal, I hope it's everything you selfishly hoped it would be. Needless to say I felt absolutely shitty for taking that part of the ring picking away from them. And looking back on it, I probably could have worked something out if I chose to reschedule. I‚Äôm not sure what to do next. So Reddit AITA? \\n\\nHey all. Appreciate all the comments and insight. For clarification, I invited both D and A to be involved in picking out the ring, because I wanted to and knew it would be important to K and I. I already knew what K would want for the ring and when I went to go see that ring I knew immediately that she would love it. I didn‚Äôt really need D or A‚Äôs help too much just their thoughts and opinions, but that ultimately it was going to be my choice. K isn‚Äôt as dramatic as her mother and honestly is much more reasonable. She and I both know that her mother can be dramatic when wronged and I‚Äôm thinking that‚Äôs the case here. I tried my best to make this a smooth engagement as possible, but now I feel like I shot myself in the foot for wronging D and now it‚Äôs gonna be an uphill battle to make amends and move forward. I‚Äôm trying to stay optimistic and be patient until D or A reach out.\",\n",

My 3 year old got diagnosed 3 weeks ago and her parents broke up a few days later. They've had a volatile relationship nearly since the beginning of their 4 year marriage. His wife seems to be suffering mental health issues and we have offered help in the past so their family doesn't break up. She doesn't seem to like any of my family so we are actually happy as it was starting to affect their 3 year old where if she was at my house and anyone was screaming or arguing she would cover her ears and climb under the dining table. So yes we don't want them back together. They have an 8 month old and the 3 year old. The 3 year old has just been diagnosed with Leukaemia. I have been trying to help with both kids with them sleeping at mine or sometimes me in the hospital with the 3 year old. My issue is this AIAH for not ignoring but just somehow don't have the time to see them for the last 3 weeks ( I am also a carer for my old mum, sister who lives with her and is intelectually disabled, she is intelectually 1 years old, and a 13 year old teenager who lives with them who lived with my mum and dad since 2 years of age but my dad died 5 years ago. There are also big problems with him that I have to deal with) I don't live with them but I go there everyday to cook, clean, take them shops and keep them company). For the last 3 weeks I have been going there but not for too long, doing just the important stuff so they are safe and ok but I've been also concentrating on my 3 year old gd. My oldest son (30) who has the other 3 year old and a 6 mth old baby had been complaining to me that I forgot I have other grand kids and I'm helping the ex so she can relax and what's the use when they are probably going to get back together anyway ( that would devestate us all as we know the kids are better in 2 happy homes than 1 ugly and angry home,) my older sons wife is also upset that I am IGNORING my  grandkids and the younger one is hitting milestones and I haven't seen any. My heart is broken when I get accused of all this especially when I just want my 3 year old gd to get back to good. This is going to be a 2 year process and I am already feeling like I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. My older son and wife are now making excuses when I find little bits of time in between to see them as they probably feel like well if you can't give your grandchildren proper time then you will get nothing. My other son doesn't know any of this as he would get upset as he feels same as me that for now there  is nothing more important than being there for my gd. I am run down but have to keep going and having the whole family support would even atleast mentally help me. So AITA ?\",\n",

I love them, but it\\'s true. I cannot handle that with my severe anxiety; i NEED to have plans communicated or else i will be too anxious to even try to enjoy my time or sometimes too anxious to go. This hasn\\'t caused anything this major until now. Another thing I think is important to note: i\\'m weird about my birthday. I\\'ve had it ruined so many times from my parents arguing to them putting down my childhood dog to my friends forgetting it entirely. So, my birthdays haven\\'t really been great especially for my childhood, so as i get older, i try to take more control and make it enjoyable for myself.\\n\\nSo, a few months back my bfs mom suggested we go on a trip after graduation. It seemed like the sweetest idea and i was over the moon about it. I have always wanted to go to europe, literally anywhere in europe. So she said we could go. I was so excited! She suggested a cruise because those tend to be cheaper and easier. however, upon looking at the prices (which ARE HIGH which makes this understandable) and realizing she would be alone in europe with two teenagers, she had us pick somewhere else. I looked with my boyfriend at the other cruises, and none seemed appealing. I suggested we figure something else out like driving somewhere in the states or going to chicago for a weekend. Fast forward to yesterday in october, she told me she booked the cruise. We had no conversation apart from months back about this. She then told me the last day is my (18th) birthday. This would be the day we are coming back, so it would literally just be a day of travel. I have cried about this several times and my boyfriend doesn\\'t seem to understand. You may say \" you can do stuff another day!\", but for me, it‚Äôs the actual day that really matters yknow? I also forgot to mention: the trip was originally me, my bf, and his mom. She decided to bring his younger brothers, who I love, but are not the most \"well behaved\". AND today I found out she\\'s bringing her weird bf that my bf and i barely know. I\\'m trying to figure out how to say I don\\'t want to go but idk what to do. AITA and any advice ???',\n",

I helped them pay for a couple things here or there and I also helped make some of the decorations in my spare time. My sister‚Äôs now wife, mother and sister-in-law are very manipulative. They have flipped stories to always make our family the bad guys in every situation. The mother and sister-in-law corner me and start screaming and calling me a c_^t and a b!tch for not having their departure planned and making their family looking like fools. I was so thrown off that I started to tear up and when they saw that they just kept going until my boyfriend came in and confronted them on what they are doing. They finally left me alone. We went back to the hotel and called it a night. I then got a text from my sister that we needed to talk before I left to go back home the next day after family breakfast. I met her down in the lobby for coffee where she then started to tell me the story about how her mother and sister-in-law came to her in tears last night claiming that my boyfriend and I verbally attacked them and called them a b!tch and a c_^t for not helping. This never happened. She walked away and went straight to her wife and did not talk to me the rest of the time I was there even though I tried to talk to her multiple times. \\nIt has been 3 years and I have not talked to my sister since the morning after her wedding.\\nAnyways back to why I might be an asshole‚Ä¶..

       " \"AITA My best friend destroyed a car - Hey Reddit, 24-year-old male here. Alright story time, so I and my college best friend 20 female have been super close friends for almost 5 years even dated in between. Now to the juice, during these 5 years together I myself work a very profitable job and have been able to afford the nicer things in life while my best friend unfortunately has not. So being a gift giver at heart, 3 years into our relationship with one another I gifted her with a car. It was a used Lexus,\\xa0 I gave this gift out of appreciation and love for her but also for safety. I will explain here in a bit as to why. Now to the parents, her parents have always been nice in a social sense but I have always felt they never had good intentions with their daughter in mind, especially with money. In the past, for context, the parents were poor at one point due to a gambling problem which has since affected them. It also doesn't help that one of the parents, father in particular doesn't work. Now my best friend still lives with her parents at home but her parents every month charge her money for rent, YES rent! Now yes it is nowhere near what rent prices are to this day but it is still a hefty sum of $1100 dollars every month. On top of that, she also has to pay insurance on her own to them which they charge a premium on as well. Lastly, they have complete access to her bank accounts. Okay, so when I purchased the Lexus for her I bought it as a gift as well as a safety thing. Why safety? Well, the reason is that she was driving around 1993 Saturn with no working airbags and ONE functional headlight. Now this Saturn was never purchased for her, it was given by the uncle. Now she had complained to her parents she wanted a new car but in return what they ended up doing was buying the mom a brand new SUV instead. So being a loving boyfriend and friend at the time I surprised her with a car. Now she had this car and had loved it for almost a year and a half until that brings us to today. just a few days ago she got into a car accident( her fault ) now as I arrived at the scene I came to find out the parents (behind her back) had lowered her coverage in secret from full coverage to liability only leaving her with a totaled car. Now I was a bit upset, not only because the gift I gave her was destroyed but because her parents would do something so sly behind her back just so they could pocket the extra money she was giving every month. (This insurance change was made 4 months ago). Now Reddit here is where I feel like the asshole, after the accident I had offered for her to drive my Porsche because she had a long commute and no car but she kindly declined. So I offered to get her another car, only for her to tell me she needed to consult her parents. So I yelled and told her she didn't need them anymore and that she needed to make a decision on her own. She got sad and yelled and has yet to talk to me.\",\n",
       " \"AITA for not getting along with my MOH‚Äôs boyfriend - This is going to be a long one, so get your popcorn!\\n\\nIt all started when I met my friend Gina a couple of years ago, and we became close. After about a year, she introduced me to her boyfriend, Jason. My fianc√© and I were excited to have another couple friend. \\n\\nAs we got to know Jason, we noticed he was often tired and would fall asleep when we hung out. He worked at his family‚Äôs office supply business, putting in long hours from 6 AM to 5 PM, plus a part-time job afterward. It became clear he didn‚Äôt have a grasp on work-life balance, as he lived at home with his family and worked with them. Jason was raised in a traditional environment that emphasized getting married and having kids, and he had never vacationed without his family. \\n\\nOne issue arose during a conversation about having kids. I expressed that I wasn't ready for children, and afterward, my fianc√© revealed that Jason texted him, suggesting he should hurry up and get me pregnant before I ‚Äúexpire.‚Äù I tried to keep the peace and didn't confront Jason about the message because whenever we disagreed with him about opinions in the past, he became defensive and shut down our opinions.\\n\\nThings escalated during our joint bachelor and bachelorette trip to NYC (it was only the 4 on the trip). Jason turned out to be a buzzkill, wanting to avoid touristy activities and insisting on going to bed by 9 PM. One night, we went to a nightclub (which we all agreed about going to), and he made Gina go to bed with him at 9PM. After he fell asleep, she joined us around midnight, but afterward, Jason wouldn‚Äôt let her do anything else after 9 PM for the rest of the trip. \\n\\nI began to resent Jason for ruining the trip and my fianc√©'s experience at his bachelor party. It felt like I had to pick up the slack to ensure my fianc√© had a good time, balancing my own bachelorette activities while also trying to cater to Jason's preferences. He was particular about timing, insisting we arrive early for reservations, which created tension. I wanted to enjoy my bachelorette party, but it felt like we were hanging out with a dad.\\n\\nOn our wedding day, tensions continued as Jason seemed upset that my fianc√© wasn‚Äôt giving him sole attention. He noticed I was quieter and not engaging with him, leading him to bombard my fianc√© with messages about why I hated him and didn‚Äôt want to be friends after the wedding. This wasn‚Äôt true; I was just trying to maintain peace in our friend group. \\n\\nAfter Jason confronted my fianc√©, I decided to send him a message explaining my feelings about the NYC trip and how he often shut down my opinions. I wanted to move past any resentment and promised to be more engaged in our conversations. He never responded to my message and now Gina no longer talks to me. She lives with Jason and his parents, works with him at the family business, and recently sold her car to share one with him. \\n\\nNow I just feel upset and hurt that Gina could so easily end our friendship even though I was trying to keep the peace and move on from what happened in the past. \",\n",

Me and star currently live on different sides of the country, because of university, but we text all the time, so we're very close.\\n\\nI had a GP appointment today because I was having some pain and wanted meds, and long story short but I ended up in hospital because of it. I have never been in hospital by myself and I have a bit of a phobia, so I texted my dad (53m) and my mum (47f) separately to see if they were free to come and be with me at some point. My dad wasn't, but mum was. I chose not to tell star, because A, she was six hours away, B, there was no emergency happening, and C, it's her birthday and I didn't want her to be worried about me when there was nothing she could do about it.\\n\\nLater, while still in hospital and having been there for several hours at this point, I get a text from Star asking why I didn't tell her that I was in hospital. I texted her back and said that I didn't want her to be worried about me. Then I texted my dad and asked him why he told her (I knew it wasnt my mum because she was sat next to me all day). He basically said that because we're all family he has a right to tell her.\\n\\nI got a bit angry at that and told him that he had no right to go telling people my personal information, and that he and I have been over this before (he has a habit of telling people things about me which end up embarrassing/on one occasion outing me). He said he thought I was overreacting, and I got mad and ignored the rest of his messages, only texting him again when I got home to let him know I was ok, which he was pretty angry about (that I'd ignored him, obviously he was happy I was fine). \\n\\nSo, AITA? \",\n",

I (F18) recently had My 18th birthday (I am from Europe, Germany specifically, so they are a big thing here).\\n\\nThe last family birthdays always ended up with family drama and me crying or even worse having a complete breakdown. So I guess you can say I am everything but not a fan of birthdays, especially not mine. So when I was around 15 I decided I would not celebrate my birthday in any form.   \\nI don‚Äôt expect gifts, calls or messages and I will never be mad if someone forgets my birthday because I don‚Äôt really share the date either. \\n\\nIt worked well for my 16th and 17th birthday. My mom and I toasted, my dad and grandparents gave me a call. I got some presents and was grateful for them. But then my 18th birthday rolled around.  \\nI was already in a bit of a pissy mood on the days leading up to it because my mom made a huge fuss about everything I have to pay her now (rent, groceries, utilities ect.) and she was constantly nagging at me that it is rude not to celebrate my birthday at all.\\n\\nWell I clearly said, multiple times a day, that I just was not interested in having to celebrate. I don‚Äôt expect gifts and everyone who feels the need to congratulate me can simply call because hey; cellphones do exist.\\n\\nWell I think you can already guess what happened. I woke up around 11 am by a screeching sound I knew all too well our doorbell. I don‚Äôt know how the hell it happened but my grandparents stood in my room. And then my mum. With huge balloons and decoration ready. I was still kind of in a delirium but anyway.\\n\\nAn hour later I went out with a former very close friend of mine because she asked me. We had brunch and then I went brought her home with me because she needed to grab some things. Well guess what? Around 20 people in our living room screaming a mix of ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù und ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù.\\n\\n20. Fucking. People. Obviously I was incredibly overwhelmed because a) I am not a people‚Äôs person and b) why is there a birthday party? I thanked everyone and took my mom aside to ask her what was going on. I mean I had my suspicions but I didn‚Äôt think that she would simply ignore every wish But surprise surprise she did.\\n\\nWell I went on with this charade for about 3 hours and then it became a bit too much for me. So I told my mom I would be leaving. And I did. I told my relatives I had other plans because I obviously didn‚Äôt know what was happening and they all showed understanding. None of them were mad at me in any way.\\n\\nI returned in the evening and boy was my mom pissed. She went on a whole rant of how disrespectful I was and that everyone was so disappointed yadda yadda yadda. Well I left again. Drive to my dad‚Äòs apartment and stayed there.

He's legally the owner, and I just help manage things. I loved working in the kitchen, designing the menu, decor, etc. He handles the business side of things and the bar. This arrangement worked for us for several years. We are close friends as well as business partners, and he's become like a surrogate brother to me. It's just a little hole in the wall, mostly, a homey place for people to eat a good meal and have a drink. Anyway---I lost my aunt about a year ago in a very traumatic way, and I was devastated about it. She was like a mother to me, and losing her destroyed me. I didn't want to be anyplace that reminded me of her, including the town we are from. My boyfriend has a home on the other side of the country, so I went there with him and spent a few months just dissociating and processing my grief. I didn't communicate with anyone for awhile, either---I just wanted to disappear until I felt better. I was in the darkest place I've ever been in my life, and honestly just felt like a zombie. I spent months just lying around, too depressed to do anything. It wasn't until recently that I have started to pull myself together and work with a therapist. \\n\\nWhen I was finally ready to come home, my partner was furious with me and does not want to continue our professional relationship or our friendship. He has abandonment issues, which I think is why he's reacting so strongly about this. I didn't mean to trigger that, I was just trying to heal myself. And yes, I understand that not everyone has the financial luxury of vanishing for an extended amount of time, but it was what I needed to grieve. Our town is fairly small and everyone knows everyone---people in our inner circle are all siding with him and ostracizing me, acting like I've committed some terrible crime for taking time for my mental health. Are people not allowed to experience grief anymore? Even my boyfriend, who is close with most of our group, seems to be starting to side with my partner. AITA? \",\n",

Both sides were happy to hear that and were accepting of the \"wedding in the future\" part.\\nAfter those talks, my fianc√© and I started planning.\\nFast forward to tonight: I was talking to my parents and I told them we have everything ready, we just need to make an appointment with an officiant and sign the papers (this could potentially happen in December if all goes well).\\nThat\\'s when everything went south: my mom started crying, saying how can we do this to them, how can she accept that her daughter is getting married and she wouldn\\'t be present, how can we just exclude them entirely and more.\\nI didn\\'t really react, I listened to her and tried to calm her down, but it took me by surprise because... we talked about this. I told them we are doing this and they seemed OK with what we decided. I still don\\'t know how to take her reaction... I swear I was upfront, I didn\\'t leave things to be misinterpreted.\\nI let her say everything she had to say, I told her I thought she understood when we talked that this is our plan. I also told her that this paper is nothing more than a formality that we want to do to have everything in order, in all the legal aspects, because we live as immigrants and CANNOT AFFORD to have any loose ends. If anything were to happen to any of us, good or bad, as immigrants we have it 10x more complicated, we cannot afford the risks.\\nAfter saying this, I told her that I will hang up because I need to think things through and sit with what happened.\\nI will also say that my father was there for the conversation, but didn\\'t say anything. He is a man of few words anyway, but, by his reaction, he gave me the impression that he knew this was to happen and had no problem with it, but didn\\'t want to confront my mom with me there. I don\\'t really know, but I feel like he will tell her off when they are alone and they can talk freely. That\\'s how he always did things, privately.\\nI don\\'t know what to do.',\n",

After I graduated I decided to sign a lease at another apartment because I wanted to live in my college town a little while longer. It‚Äôs a two bedroom but the rent is absurd. I figured I would have a decent job at this point but my area has way less opportunities than I expected. After talking with my parents I decided I needed to move home and save money after I find someone to sublet my apartment. I didn‚Äôt think I would have any luck finding someone but someone eventually responded to my post. They are an international student who is female. Her employer would be covering the rent so I figured she didn‚Äôt care too much about the price tag. I talked to my roommate (it‚Äôs a two bedroom) who I have been living with for the past three years asked me to find someone else because he does not want to live with a girl. I find it hard to understand why he is so uncomfortable because we lived with one last year. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to have much luck with finding someone else and I really need to jumpstart my career somewhere else before I have a suspicious gap in my resume.

       " \"AITA for blaming my OH for losing her stuff? - My OH(37F) is really scatterbrained, she puts things down and almost immediately forgets where she puts them. I am always trying to subtly hint that if she had a specific place to put certain items they would be a lot easier to find or even put a note on her phone or something because the amount of stuff she loses is just ridiculous. Most recently though, she has lost her hearing aids (she is partially deaf from a medical condition). She claims she has looked everywhere for them but she can't remember what she has done with them. She is now talking about taking out a credit card or loan to replace them and I told her that was a ridiculous waste of money because they must be somewhere in the apartment and she can't have looked that thoroughly. She has done this in the past where she thinks she's lost something, looks in like 3 places then replaces it to find it a month later. She thinks I'm being an AH and unsupportive but I'm just so sick of forking out money all the time because she can't keep track of her stuff. We don't have much money to start with and this just seems like a huge waste to me. I know she needs her hearing aids but it feels like she wants to take the easy option and put us into debt because she can't be bothered to look for them properly. I have tried to be supportive and have spent hours looking for them as well but I have no idea where she would have left them as she doesn't have a place she always puts them so they could literally be anywhere. So AITA for not wanting to spend hundreds of dollars on something she'll probably find eventually anyway?\\n\\nEDIT: she is not completely deaf, she has partial hearing loss so she can manage without hearing aids unless she is somewhere with a lot of background noise like a busy restaurant.\",\n",

We never had to buy anything because whatever one could use to cook a meal, she had at least one of them. But I prefer to eat at the Mensa at Uni as the meals are cheap and not half bad.

We had not previously discussed this and it wasn‚Äôt until after the shower that she asked; her reasoning was that the friend we were having shower for would not like it if we spent so much on the shower...???(also, my husband has done well at his job this year and there have been little comments that I‚Äôve heard some of this group of girls make about how ‚Äúhe can afford that‚Äù etc.) This felt to me like she realized my husband is doing well in his job and wanted to capitalize on that‚Ä¶  \\n\\nAlso, co-host was in charge of food; myself and mom-2-be wanted to go with cheaper option, however, she insisted on going with more spendy caterer and told me it was because she thought he was attractive/wanted to flirt with him.

The passport I've had paid like $200 for recently I asked her if she had my high school diploma and if I could have it so I could get back into school she said that she would look, but she got really mad that I had my own birth certificate, Social Security card and passport and said that they aren't mine legally they are and I told her that she says that I can get a copy but I can't have the originals and I need to give them back. I told her no she's more than welcome to get a copy but as for the originals, they are mine she doesn't need them unless she's trying to do fraudulent stuff. I told her if she can get me a copy that's fine but I will not pay for it. I heard it's a tricky process and I don't want to do that because I have the originals anyway to sum it up. I ended up telling her I'm not going to give you my birth certificate, Social Security card and passport especially the passport since I paid for it because she has no necessity or legal right to it.\",\n",

I usually make birthday boxes of the milestone birthdays (10,13, and now 16) i usually print off some photos and add some more things about the night. i also add the cards everyone gave me. if you know me i love cards better than presents . so when i noticed that her card wasnt there i thought i lost it. by the way she has a bad habit of self excluding herself. I then noticed that she just didnt give me anything. So i decided to ask her if she could write me a card so she's not excluded. and she responded with omg i totally forgot about your party. don't worry ill give it to you on monday.

Before moving in J organised everything to do with viewing multiple houses and going to the viewings with me, no one else did anything to help they just wanted to see the pictures from the viewings and say yes or no.\\n\\n When we finally found a house, me and J went looking for appliances that would be nice to have, we found a good set of microwave, airfryer and grill for ¬£50 an hour and half away, we couldn\\'t pass on the deal and asked everyone for ¬£10 so that it could be a shared expense and everyone could use it whilst we\\'re living there, so me and J went to go pick it up.\\n\\nAfter living together after a couple of weeks F stopped cleaning up after herself leaving dirty dishes in the sink for days at a time to the point where we could not see the sink, at this point L and F were not friends so F came to me, J and A to talk about the mess F was making and wpuld talk shit behind her back. Fast forward a couple of weeks of this and suddenly L stops talking to me, J and A out of nowhere and starts being besties with F. So we call a flat meeting to see what\\'s going on as there is unnecessary tension in the flat.\\n\\nTo our surprise L talks about how we make her uncomfortable for speaking bad behind F\\'s back and that she\\'s too mature for that kind of thing. We also addressed some other issues like the dishes and the fact that L keeps leaving the front door unlocked after going in or out of the flat without telling anyone so we\\'d go to sleep with the door unlocked (we live in the middle of the city due to being at uni).\\n\\nFast forward to present day, another flat meeting is called by L, she tells us that her and her boyfriend bought a house and she will be moving out in January. Me and J are also planning to move out after the new year because we\\'ve had enough of L and F, so we told them our plan and they start shouting at us saying \"thanks for telling us\" and so on. We also mentioned that we will be taking everything we bought for the flat for our new house, which would be basically 50% of the things in the living room and kitchen as no one else chipped in. F then starts arguing for the fact that she wants her ¬£10 back for the appliances after using them for almost 2 years, me and J refused and said we went to go pick them up and we found them and everyone has used them loads so you had your ¬£10 worth of use. She then started saying that taking everything that\\'s communal is unfair and F and A should be left some things (even though only me and J paid for them). A already knew about us looking to move out and she was perfectly okay with everything that we said we would be taking as she\\'s made arrangements to move back to her parents house after me and J move out as she\\'s had enough of L and F too. \\n\\nSo who are the flatmates from hell here?',\n",

I called her out and all hell has broken loose. \\n\\nMy Step Dad (mum\\'s partner) passed a couple of months ago. Since then she has been visiting my younger sibling and smoking Cannabis with them, and a significant amount at that, then driving home high.

She is risking sibling she is smoking with as she was sectioned for Psychosis last time she smoked it and lost custody of her daughter as a result\\n3. Risking OTHER sibling that lives with us as he is Schizophrenic and when she last enabled him to smoke it he was also sectioned\\n4. That I\\'m currently undergoing immunotherapy which causes me significant nausea, migraines etc and the pungent smell on her is making me feel much worse\\n5.

That I had to raise younger sibling when I myself was a child (I\\'m a decade older) because she spent all her time alone in her room getting high and I had to pick up the slack and I find it triggering she is being selfish again in similar way (she had quit for the past few years up until partner\\'s recent passing)\\n7.

We would text and call each other even hangout together. We were literally sisters at this point and didn\\'t think anything would break that bond.

       " 'WIBTA for Moving out of MIL House - Hi all, I have a really strange situation I‚Äôm hoping to get a neutral third party perspective on. \\nMy husband, toddler and I currently live with my MIL. We also have another baby on the way. We all rent a house together and she relies on our portion of rent to live here. She has the master bedroom, only garage space, has decorated the entire house to her liking, takes up 99% of kitchen storage space, and has her own office. My husband, daughter, and I occupy less than 500 sq feet of space between the three of us. My husband and I have a tiny bedroom that barely fits a queen bed. My daughter has her own room. We have an unattached bathroom. We also have a cat and dog. The cat has to live in our room and is not allowed to free roam as he may scratch her furniture. She also has a dog, and that has been an issue as well. Her dog is a 90+ pound pitbull that regularly gets ‚Äútoo excited‚Äù and knocks our daughter over and won‚Äôt stop kissing her. She has hit her head badly from this several times and I am concerned for her safety. The dog also begs for food anytime someone is eating and will jump up to grab food off my daughter‚Äôs high chair tray. Very little accountability has been taken to train the dog or acknowledge its behavior other than putting it in its crate. In fact, our dog is often blamed for this behavior because he barks which ‚Äúgets the dog going‚Äù. \\nHere‚Äôs my issue: clearly this living situation no longer feels suitable. We already don‚Äôt have enough space with my toddler and we will quickly run out of room when our newborn is here. We‚Äôve already been declined on putting a rocking chair in the upstairs loft that nobody uses. It‚Äôs an issue to transition her office into a nursery for the baby. We really just want to move and we‚Äôd prefer they get their own place. \\nWe currently pay half of all bills, except grocery bills, which we pay roughly 80% of. When we moved into this living situation, no boundaries were set around rent and we had to make them up as we went along. We were originally each paying $900 a month and we experienced a tragedy in our family that set us back on paying rent. Due to that we had several months of unpaid rent and it got her into a rough financial situation. I‚Äôve since paid my MIL $5000 to make up for this, and have taken over a larger portion of bills. However, I feel it‚Äôs now become unbalanced on the other end. It is really emotionally exhausting and frustrating living here. I‚Äôm sad this is our life and our children‚Äôs lives. I don‚Äôt see a way out. We could financially afford to move, but I don‚Äôt want to leave her hanging after she helped us when we were in a tough spot. The situation is so toxic for so many more reasons than I can even list. We are technically on a lease for 1.5 more years, but the lease is technically invalid because another roommate never signed it. I really want to move but don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs morally ethical- but my little family is suffering as a result.\\n\\nWIBTA for moving?\\n',\n",

       " \"AITA:Leaving my boyfriend behind  - So little backstory, my boyfriend (m/38) is constantly underestimating how much time he needs to reach buss stop or trainstop  or any other mode of transport that's organised  with a set time in mind, including when I pick him up with a car. Great example is that he needs to be home at 5 pm because we planned something important together and alot of things are reliant on that fact. He will come 40-60 min later,  blaming that he missed the bus. No problem most of you are probably thinking,  till the reason makes it self apparent.  He had to to the toilet... every single time he waits till the last possible second and he doesn't count in the walking time,how long he will need to be there and he doesn't even look up when the bus goes. Basically he does everything in his power to not succeed. So today we were at library together,  he had football training in the evening and we still had to get home early enough to prepare dinner,  att no point did he do any od the mental math required  to make the plans foe our return home so half an hour before our bus goes I let him know we should go. We pack up and we re go the lobby, it's  a 5 min  walk to the buss station and  our buss was going to be there in 12 minutes.  Mind you it's cold and windy outside, and buses go att a halv hour intervals,  it also takes 20-25 min to reach home by buss plus a 10 min walk that has us looking att a 35 min journey.  Dinner had to be made and missing the buss is a over 1 hour ordeal leaving absolutely no time to cook before trainingstarts,  so long story short,  I wasn't  going to miss the bus. So there were we in the lobby and like so many times before he decided to go and use the toilet. I waited 8 min and he still wasn't back , I can't run because of knee injury I had and I also despise having to run to catch the bus so I packed my things and left for the bus station. Mind you...he had us miss the bus so many times before for this exact reason and today i just couldn't make myself wait for him, my phone has both of our tickets but he also had his bank card so he could buy a short time ticket himself (I didn't left him stranded). So I boarded the bus and right as the bus started to drive I could see him running in the distance,  he spotted me sitting on the buss and he looked extremely angry with me. I feelt like I did the right thing by leaving, because staying and waiting in the cold after having us run for the 3000000 x time was something I wasn't going to keep enabling to happen. I feel bad but,  I don't want to enable this anymore...\",\n",

We have a pretty small sink and with 3 people sharing the kitchen, there's always a ton of dishes left in this. It came to the point where they were piled up so high it would touch the faucet. I asked one of my roommates if he would wash the dishes but he told me half of them weren't his. Since we share dishes, we don't know who used what and that became a problem. We came up with the solution to never leave anything in the sink.

I just washed whatever I use and put them back were they're supposed to be. Both of my roommates still keep leaving stuff in the sink.  I've reminded them so many times about our rule that even I'm tired of it. One of my roommates told me I'm uptight because I asked the third roommate to wash the two dirty dishes he left in the sink.

It was a huge part of the class. But still my parents insisted that I help. They said I should think of my siblings. I tried to leave but they took my keys. My siblings started to say I should want to spend time with them and I lost my temper a little. I told them to stop. They got what they wanted and I was helping but this was the last time. I told them I will never help them or spend time with them again because they are too selfish to deserve it. My siblings got upset and my parents started to lecture me and I told them to save it because they are just shitty parents. My parents have really gone hard on me for what I said since last week. They called me an evil teenager who lacks empathy.\\n\\nAITA?',\n",
       " 'WIBTA if I send an angry message calling two classmates selfish after they unilaterally decided to ask the professor to change dates for a Midterm? - Alright, first of all, let me get some things out of the way. I live in Argentina, and attend UBA -public University-. At the moment, some colleges -including mine- have been ‚Äútaken‚Äù by the students in protest of the government cuts to education. Therefore, the situation is unique. \\n\\nOn week ago, our professor gave us the date for the two final exams. Luckily, it fit into my work schedule perfectly -I‚Äôm a full time English teacher in Primary School-. \\n\\nHowever, two classmates decided to ask him to change dates because it coincided with another exam of theirs. It should be noted that there‚Äôs always time for makeover when things like this happen. Even though there‚Äôs a WhatsApp group, they have an F, asked no one about it and asked for the change. \\n\\nNow, the dates have been changed, the classmates offered some lame ass apology where they said that it was in the best interest of everyone, and my schedule has been f-ed. \\n\\nI had another exam close to the original date, and I asked for days off work to prepare for both of them. Now, I‚Äôll have to rearrange the presentation of a play with 7th form, meetings with families and a camping trip. And the time I would have allotted to one of those exams will be non existent -the second exam that was closer in time has a former that doesn‚Äôt allow me to ask for time off work. \\n\\nAt the same time, I have my brothers wedding in the middle of this mess and, as a result of the change, I won‚Äôt be able to take the exam until three weeks from now -crashing into everything k name in the previous paragraph-. \\n\\nSo, would I be the asshole if I call these classmates selfish and immature for thinking only of themselves and changing the entire schedule just to fit them without any regard for others?

       " 'AITA for telling my vegan friend I don‚Äôt want to come over for Thanksgiving Dinner? -   I (54f) have a friend (55f) who went vegan 10 years ago. We‚Äôve been friends 20 years or more. We have a large group of friends 15-20 and there are a few of us that switch off cooking dinner on Thanksgiving for whoever is in town. \\nSince ‚ÄúAnn‚Äù went vegan we‚Äôve always accommodated her dietary restrictions with at the very least some tofurkey, one side dish and one dessert being strictly vegan.  \\n  This year Ann jumped in early and for the first time ever said she wanted to cook Thanksgiving this year. Not a problem. Until she informed us in the group chat dinner will be 100% vegan. Some of us offered to bring more omnivore offerings, including a turkey and she insisted we eat vegan while at her house. She declared that vegan food ‚Äútastes exactly the same‚Äù as omnivore food. It does not. I‚Äôve been to her house and choked down bean burgers and chocolate cake and probably a dozen other meals each of which she insisted tasted just like the real thing. She even tried to fool me once with a beyond burger, insisting is was a regular hamburger. \\n  I have only found a limited number of vegan dishes I enjoy and none of them have ever been made by her. \\nAfter thinking it over and discussing it with my husband we decided to privately tell her we were bowing out of dinner on Thanksgiving this year. I told her I wanted turkey, mashed potatoes, pumpkin pie that were made with traditional ingredients. \\n  I could have lied and said we had plans to travel to see family but I don‚Äôt want lie. \\n  Ann has become angrier and angrier with me since I told her this about a week ago. Then she went and complained to some of the women in our group about me refusing to attend just because she‚Äôs cooking. \\n\\nWhich is sort of true but still made me angry. So I ended explaining to the other ladies that we all very considerately make vegan dishes just for her at every party and get together any of us throw and it‚Äôs really unreasonable for her to insist that I strictly adhere to her dietary choices when I have never demanded the same from her. \\n\\n  So that blew up because all the ladies have now jumped to my way of thinking and decided they will have Thanksgiving at one of their houses instead. (We will not be attending their Thanksgiving either)\\n\\n  My husband says we probably should have lied about going out of town or at the very least I should have not explained my reasoning to the other ladies. \\n\\n  I‚Äôve decided to stay out of it from here on out but somehow Anna blames me for the whole debacle. AITA for declining to attended a vegan thanksgiving? ',\n",
       " \"AITA for using my daughter's Amazon gift card? - I (35f) and my family (husband 37m, daughter 11f, and daughter 6f) just attended a Halloween party where my oldest daughter was awarded first place in the costume contest. \\n\\nSome back story; I spent the last 3 months planning, designing, and hand making all of our costumes. We went as Alice in Wonderland characters. I was the white rabbit, husband was Mad Hatter, youngest was Alice, and oldest was Queen of Hearts. Her costume was by far the most involved and difficult for me. I literally broke down in tears over the standing collar 3 days before the party. My daughter, though she is very creative and artistic, did not give me much input into the costume aside from a few ideas on details and encouragement throughout the process. Tbf I didn't expect her to, she's not as into Halloween or dressing up as I am. \\n\\nThe day of the party, all the elements came together perfectly. Her costume was one of the best I've made, her hair and accessories were perfect. And out of 30+ people, her costume won the contest. I was very proud watching her accept her prize which was a trophy and a gift bag. When she sat down to look in the gift bag, she showed me the candle which I took to believe was the only thing in the bag. \\n\\nLater in the night, I was informed that there was also a $50 Amazon gift card in the bag. I found my daughter and teased her that she conveniently forgot to show me the gift card and that technically it should be mine since I did all the work (even though I actually had no intentions of taking it.) She got really flustered and upset but didn't say anything. Later her dad (my husband) found out about the gift card and also mentioned that it should be mine. At this, my daughter got upset again and said it should be hers since the prize was awarded to her. I told her she could have the gift card if I could keep the trophy out in the library and not buried in her room, to which she begrudgingly obliged. \\n\\nWe've all had 2 nights to think on it and I still believe that the gift card should go to me, but let me be clear that I do not intend to use the gift card, I only want my daughter to admit that I earned that prize and maybe a thank you for my months of hard work. I'm only making this post either for commenters to help me see how I'm wrong or for validation. \\n\\nPs, I'm not on reddit a lot so I apologize if my post is not how it's normally done. \\n\\nEdit: it's clear from the first few comments that i am in the wrong. I will not bring it up to her anymore, and she will be allowed to spend the gift card how she wants. Thanks everyone :)\\n\\nEdit 2: Just to be clear, I never intended to take the gift card from her whether the comments sided w me or not.\",\n",

Jays room isn‚Äôt horrible in the sense of a hoarder, there are walk ways to her bed, the bathroom, closet, and living room, but anywhere outside of those walkways there is clutter, clothes, food, drinks, trash, etc. They also have mildew or black mold on her ceiling in the bedroom as well as the living room, and they have mice. She drives recklessly, sometimes she almost passes of while driving, when she isn‚Äôt tired, she still runs red lights and stop signs and will swerve, and she‚Äôs also almost ran off the road on a curve. Also her kids have been off from school two days while I‚Äôve been here and each time I have seen them on the living room couch so I got curious and looked in one of the bedrooms and it was what you see on hoarders there was no walkway, and there was also no way of sleeping on the bed that is in there.\\n\\nSo with everything I‚Äôve seen, the mice, the mildew/mold, and the kids not having a place to sleep besides the couch.

I work away from home mostly and I'm away for weeks at a time but get to spend weeks at a time at home also. Normally she's left at home alone during the weeks that I'm away. Recently she celebrated her 27th birthday and unfortunately I was away and couldn't be there for her. I managed to have flowers delivered to her even though I was thousands of miles away and also told her I'll do something special for her when I get back. The day passed smoothly for her. Her 2 seperate friend groups both got her a cake each and basically a small celebration for her, one during the day and one during the night. I was happy for her and planned my part for when I get home. Fast forward a couple of days. I made a joke about a having a crush on a girl on tiktok who is from another country and wayyy out of my leave. We often make jokes and all so I didn't think much of it. Low and behold, she starts off. Arguing about something that happened last month, about her friends doing more for her birthday than I did, etc. I tried explaining to her that I'm not there so she cannot compare me to her friends. And also I'll do something more for her since I'm unable to do it being so far away. It's becoming normal for her to act entitled now, she's always saying I don't do anything got her. I don't provide for her. I don't give her anything. Point to note, she's driving my car, she has the latest iPhone, an apple watch, earpods, I pay the rent and bills and also pay for food.  All I ask is that she uses her money that she works for and take care of herself. But no matter what, she always forgets all i do for her. Act entitled, and demands more. I keep feeling sorry for her because if I leave, she would have to do all this alone. Every time I leave for work, she always causes a fight and creates an issue between us. She's the only person i get to talk to since I'm away and work 13 hour shifts. I expect that she would at least be there for me but sadly, majority of the time, that's not the case. Every time I get back home and we fix issue, I forgive her and we are happy again, but the cycle repeats itself when I leave for work again.

We have a strong emotional and physical bond, and there are a lot of great things about our relationship. \\n\\nOne recurring thing that is difficult is that she has frequent ups and downs that impact her ability to deal with what life throws at her, so to speak. She frequently struggles with organization, job stability, and meeting her own needs. She is in therapy and on medication for ADHD. I empathize with all of this and have been trying to show up for whatever I can without sacrificing my own mental health: I help with chores, child care, daily tasks, and emotional support quite often. We do not live together and this is one reason why I have not taken that step, I have my own history of depression and anxiety and I fear cohabitating like this will trigger my own issues. \\n\\nI suppose the burnt out feeling comes from the fact that I routinely get texts and messages from her about how stressful and unfair everything is in her life, about how she is personally being victimized, and there is a lot of relinquishing of control in these messages. I am not a person who likes a pity party, I have been through really hard stuff in my life and tbh she has a good support system and I just feel like sometimes she is just wallowing because it‚Äôs comfortable for her. But this all impacts our relationship and our future together, and I just feel very exhausted by all of it at this point.

I said I'm busy. He said it was fine but was there space to park his car at mine. Yes but he'd need to collect car by Wednesday. I wouldn't be able to give him a lift to my house to pick it up due to work &amp; personal commitments. He ignored this and kept saying about me picking him up, why couldn't I do Wednesday. Told him I was busy.\\nHe then tells me how he never asks for anything. How he's done so much for me. I said it wasn't my fault he can't get a bus and it wasn't my fault I can't just drop things for him.\\nHe said how selfish I was, how he'd done everything for me but every time he asked for a favour I threw it back at him and he said how selfish I was (plus several choice names and swearing). \\nI said expecting people to drop things for you with zero notice was the definition of selfish.\\nHe called my family telling them how selfish I am and how he does everything. As he's organising Christmas this year I'm banned from that too.\\nFast forward an hour and I get a message 'if I have any love and respect for him I'll meet him this week'. \\nI've said I'll meet publicly to discuss and he's kicking off saying if I won't come to his home it's a problem and how could I suggest public what do I think he's going to do.

It has been our family tradition for years.\\n\\nMy oldest sister (37f) has 2 kids and is currently pregnant, due her 3rd baby before Christmas. Usually this time of the year, we pick our Secret Santa names but my sister said she doesn't want to do it this year as she is not able to afford it, which I thought was totally understandable.\\n\\nWhat I have a problem with is she doesn't want any of us to do it. She wants us to get each kid a ‚Ç¨20 toy shop voucher and to just buy my parents a present as a gesture for all the babysitting they do during the year. \\n\\nAlthough I know her idea comes from a good place, I still don't see the point in it. It might seem selfish but I know I will miss opening up a present Christmas morning.

Im 20 years old and I work a closing shift at a store almost every day. Yesterday Was an 8 hour morning shift and today is another 6 hour shift for the afternoon. Now everytime I get home I like to spend a little bit of time to myself to relax. That‚Äôs it. My mom knocks on my door and tells me I got a dentist appointment tomorrow.

And I love my mom, but she has a temper, she yelled at me and threatens to disconnect the wifi router and turn off the Internet at night if I don‚Äôt go. Maybe beat me too, who knows? Because she knows I like to spend my night gaming. I know there‚Äôs nothing I could do about this because it is under her roof. But I‚Äôm like tired man. For some reason some anger has been festering up too because over the years I was promised braces, and I don‚Äôt know why I thought of it now.

       " 'AITA for shouting at my housemate and his new girlfriend during their obnoxiously loud sex? - **Context:**\\n\\nI (25M) rent a room in a house and have lived here for 2 years. My housemate (25M, who owns the house) was my best friend since school but I would say our friendship has deteriorated over this time.\\n\\nTo be polite, I think my housemate has a lot of growing up to do. He is negligent in looking after his house, rarely cleans or tidies, does the bare minimum for a rescued cat we took in, and the garden is an overgrown wasteland of weeds. His job has an odd shift pattern but on days off he just goes to his parents\\' house and takes his laundry with him. He stopped asking to hang out a long while ago, so I don\\'t spend any quality time with him anymore despite living in his house. He still goes to see other friends or invites them over so I feel he has neglected our friendship entirely.\\n\\nI have been with my boyfriend for a year and a half and we have never done anything like what I am about to describe. He has witnessed this as the sound comes through on video call.\\n\\n**Conflict:**\\n\\nAbout a month ago, housemate brings a new girl to the house. He says they\\'ve been on a few dates and it\\'s been going well, so I congratulate him. I stay out of their way as it\\'s the early days and they want to have dinner and watch TV or a film together, much like my boyfriend and I do, all good.\\n\\nThen the sex starts. This girl is an absolute screamer. I am talking moans to out-do even the most over-eager pornstar. Cat yowling, tortoise sex, donkey roars, dying child. All good comparisons. They were doing it past 2am which kept me AND the neighbour\\'s dog awake (it started barking. The houses are terraced so the walls are connected to the neighbours too). I manage to get to sleep, but am startled awake 5 hours later when the moans pierce through the walls and shatter my dream state.\\n\\nI spoke to my housemate after the girl left, jovially explained I heard everything, tried to make light of the situation. I can overlook a one-off or even two-off if it was an errant good night for him. He\\'s also had other girls over without any problems. He loosely apologised but then said \"I can\\'t promise it won\\'t happen again because it probably will\". The next time he said she was coming over, I more seriously asked in passing if they could keep it down and was met with a sarcastic \"No\". The situation still continued. Screaming at night, screaming in the morning.\\n\\nLast night was the 12th occurrence by my count, and I snapped. I shouted through their door \"Could you please shut the fuck up? Thank you\". They stopped, and I think she asked to be taken home as they fled the house soon after. It\\'s now the day after and I haven\\'t spoken to my housemate but I would appreciate an apology and acknowledgement it will stop. I tried being diplomatic, but it seems like he hasn\\'t bothered bringing it up with this girl, so I don\\'t think I had a choice other than the nuclear option. It was driving me crazy, and honestly, I don\\'t feel bad in the slightest. I live here, I can reasonably expect some peace.\\n\\nAITA?',\n",

We both worked at a large Military Hospital.\\n\\nEarlier this year, ‚ÄúJohn [20m],‚Äù who recently started working at the hospital, was asking around our department for people he could carpool with. Everyone gave various reasons why they couldn‚Äôt help, and eventually I volunteered because he lived nearby and it wouldn‚Äôt be out of my way to pick him up.\\n\\n(I will preface this by noting John was very well liked in our department with most of the older ladies adopting him as their ‚Äúwork son‚Äù etc. He‚Äôs also the youngest employee by almost a decade.)\\n\\nThis issues started about one month in when I noticed every morning after I picked him up, he would bring various food products to eat on the drive to work. This didn‚Äôt bother me at first, but as time went on he was leaving food trash and crumbs in my vehicle. I‚Äôm an extremely clean individual, so this bothered me and I said something. He continued eating, and kept forgetting to clean after himself. I was getting tired of constantly reminding him to take his trash with him, and I started just throwing the trash away myself. After doing this a few times, I decided to just leave the trash, and see if he would notice.\\n\\nHe didn‚Äôt. For weeks the empty water bottles, redbull cans, candy wrappers and empty containers started to pile up in by passenger door and floorboard, and stayed until I asked him politely ‚Äúcould you take that trash with you?‚Äù His response of ‚Äúyeah of course, I don‚Äôt mind‚Äù made me feel like he thought it was MINE and I was asking for a favor. \\n\\nThere‚Äôs more examples, but to keep things short, I gave him an ultimatum, he needed to clean up after himself and respect my car, or he would need to find another ride to work.\\n\\nNot even a week later, he was eating some type of meal with flaky crackers and it was spilling on his lap the entire ride to work. When we pulled into the parking garage, he dusted all the food crumbs from his lap onto my carpet. We left the car and went to work. After work, when I returned to my car, there were ants inside of my vehicle.\\n\\nI had enough. So I made up an excuse, and told him I couldn‚Äôt give him rides.\\n\\nHe took it well, and the rides stopped. But over the next few weeks, his tardiness started to pile up. His agency fired him in September. We are not privy to contractors personnel issues, but everyone assumes he was fired for being chronically late.\\n\\nFast forward to today, while on break, I overheard some folks saying he was fired because I stopped giving him a ride to work and that was selfish of me etc. I never told anyone except him why I stopped, and I‚Äôm assuming he told them some half baked truth and because he was well liked, I know they believe him.\\n\\nAm I the asshole?',\n",

And also one of the three girls (Mary) and the other two girls where closer with each other (Anna and Kim). We never had a problem in our group until summer came, where we all tried to keep in touch, but me and the others had their stuff to do, so we would randomly do out with parts of the group (for example i one spent a weekend just with Max, or a day with Max and Mary) and they obviously did the same thing.

But apparently my husband doesn't like it??\\n\\nToday, we woke up at 545am, late because he wanted to sleep in so I'm like fk it, ill sleep in too. Child woke up twice at night and I'm the only one who settles the child at night so I'm tired anyway. \\n\\nWe wake up, he goes to shower and I go to workout. Child wakes up just as I'm done on the treadmill so I got about 20 minutes of workout in. I hand the child to husband and tell him I'm taking a quick shower. He's pissed. It's 615am. I ask him whats wrong and he goes on a rant that he hoped I would help him get ready. \\n\\nI'm confused because I don't usually help make breakfast/ lunch for him unless we have nothing prepared in the fridge for lunch (I prep food before or we have leftovers for lunch) or if I want to make something special for breakfast. Plus we woke up late. So I tell him if he wanted my help, he could have asked. I didn't realize he wanted my help. He gets more worked up and said that he needs to leave earlier and now he's late. \\n\\nI went to take a shower and reflected on it but I just can't see his side in this. So when I was done and took the child (it's 6:30am) and he's still upset, I ask him why he's upset with me. He again, says that I should have helped him with breakfast so he could have left earlier. I just told him that if he wants my help, to ask me next time and he left for work in a huff. \\n\\nAITA in this situation? I'm just so confused üò≠ \\n\\nEdit to add: I forgot to mention that when he first told me that he hoped I would wake up earlier, he also said that he's upset that I waited until 545 to wake up. That I should have woken up earlier?? I told him that's not fair because I wake up with the child at night.\\n\\nAND! When I missed out on working out for almost a week because of mental health, he said I was getting lazy so I have no idea what this man wants from me ü•≤\\n\\nEdit 2: IM STILL WORKING EVERYONE üò≠ So much confusion, sorry. My last day of work is today and so is my kids last of daycare.  He works an office job 40 hours a week and so did I until I went down to part time.\",\n",

I have been put in the middle of the issue between my brother and our mother for the last few years and over that time I have asked for advice from my close friends.

He calls me aggressively an ally and has made it clear that he doesn't think I did anything wrong or harmful but I'm not so sure. \\n\\nHe is not on hormone therapy and has not had any gender affirming procedures. He has said that my friends would know he is trans as he is not passing so its not a big deal but I genuinely feel like I took some of his autonomy away by not allowing him the space to disclose when and how he wants to. \\n\\nMy brother is a beautiful human being and I know he would never hold this against me but I also know he lost the opportunity to navigate this as an adult on his own term on his first adulting experience.\\n\\n \",\n",

Solid, happy marriage. I'm a middle manager-type and was making about $135k/yr until two years ago, when the company for which I worked was bought and I got a nice payout. I had been miserable in that job for a long time and had worked very, very hard, so I quit. I've been working as a consultant fairly successfully ever since, but I still hate what I do. \\n\\nMy wife left her job after our son was born in 2002 (her choice) and has been freelancing for the last 15 years or so. I've told her repeatedly that she doesn't have to work if she doesn't want to -- she has health issues and fatigue is a huge problem for her, plus we're solid financially. But she has always wanted to contribute to our income, so she takes work when she can. She's often lamented that she wished she could do more. Regardless, I've brought in about 85% - 90% of the household income since we married.\\n\\nISSUE:  \\nWhen I quit my job in 2022, we lost my employer health insurance. We found out that if one of us took a class through a local college -- just one class a year --  we could get insurance through the college that was good coverage for less than Marketplace insurance.

We recently determined that we've saved enough that we can retire early, so I'm stopping work at the end of 2024. I am ecstatic about it. But my wife now thinks that since I won't be working next year, I should be the one to take a class so we can continue getting insurance through the college. Her reasoning is that she'll still be working (even though her work is sporadic), so I should be responsible for taking the class. \\n\\nAITA for refusing to take classes?

They are both SAHM, all the children are in the disability programs my country offers but there is not much money left, after all the medical bills of therapy and meds they need.

I knew these two girls there. I was thinking about Brad because the rumours were bad and one of the girls knew Brad's girlfriend.

This led to Denise messaging me on behalf of Emily, saying I was implicating her and Emily and I tried to explain my intentions which she did not believe as Janice told her a different story and she believed if I actually felt guilty, I wouldn't have said the rumour to Janice, which makes sense to say, but I just made a mistake. She said Janice never said that I said I felt bad about Brad or that I thought Emily told Brad, making it harder to explain. I feel bad for Brad after this as due to my fooish actions, the whole 'drama' spiralled out of control. AITA?\",\n",

She is from China, but has pretty good English, and I grew up in Australia most my life, and my English is good, (yes it\\'s relevant). \\n\\nDuring the last two years (2022, 2023), I had a \\'rogue teenager\\' patch, where I was also dealing with clinical depression. She is very firm in her asian parenting style and it tends to clash with my upbringing in a western country, and also, my dad (m67)\\'s parenting style. During my \\'rouge teenager\\' patch, I had a boyfriend, and I pierced my own ear, but I mostly kept to myself.\\n\\nIn response to my boyfriend, she called me a \\'slut\\' and a \\'whore\\' while I was at an overseas competition. I cried so loud in my hotel room, members of my team in different rooms told the chaperones that they should check on me. When they did, I told them what was happening, and my mum, of course, found out. She said she \\'hoped CPS would take me away\\' and that she \\'wasnt my mum anymore; biologically yes though unfortunately\". \\n\\nI accidentally came across text messages with her coworker, where she said that \\'she wished she never had a child\\' and later, \\'I hate daughters, I wish I had a son instead\\'. It hurt me alot but my dad said all parents say that so I tried to let it go. \\n\\nThen, at my lowest (mentally), I tried opening up to her and in response, she told me I was the reason she was depressed and that I gave her such \\'PTSD\\' that she will never be the same, that I permanently traumatised her. She also often called me fat during this time, and complained to my dad that my thighs were disgusting. So I turned to my dad, and he wasn\\'t happy with her, so she told me that I was \\'trying to get them to divorce\\'. My parents are constantly fighting at the moment, and they live almost separately to the point where all my friends just assume that they actually are divorced and I feel it\\'s my fault.\\n\\nThis is only a tiny, tiny amount of examples of the things shes done. When this all built up a few weeks ago, we had a massive argument, which ended in her apologising (after denying ever saying any of it), but I still dont truly accept her apologies. They are always \\'I\\'m sorry if that happened\\', or \\'im sorry im a bad mum\\' or \\'I\\'m sorry youre so sensitive\" or \"I\\'m sorry but I didn\\'t even know its hurtful\" and I dont feel like it\\'s right. At the time, my dad said he\\'s proud of her for being brave for apologising, and I should accept whatever I get. He said it\\'s the language barrier\\'s fault, not hers. \\n\\nAITA for not accepting this? Or is my dad right? I\\'m only 16, so some external guidance would be good.\\n\\nTL;DR My mum made hurtful comments, and her apologies feel almost backhanded, so I refuse to accept them. AITA?',\n",

I have high anxiety so I always think in worst case scenarios and decide what to do accordingly. I feel like he doesn‚Äôt have any respect for any of my stuff while I am extremely careful with others items. The first instance was when he was helping me move, I have some upholstered chairs that are a tight fit but will fit through the doorway if you maneuver them right. He and his friend were having trouble getting them out of my apartment and I asked them to please be careful, the chair got stuck and I again asked them to be careful. He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just going to shove it through‚Äù at which point I said ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt do that, try moving it this way‚Äù and I was disregarded and he pushed it as hard as he could and tore the fabric.

Another instance was when I had an old kind of beat up desk that I planned on fixing, he decided to use it as a workbench while he was fixing up a room in the house. When I saw that he was using it I was uncomfortable because it was a huge mess and easily scratched and I could tell it was damaged more. I ended up taking all of his stuff off of it and using one of his own things in its place. I told him to please ask before using my things because it had gotten damaged.

       " \"AITAH For Throwing A Going Away Luncheon Without the Supervisor - A coworker will call Amber is leaving for a new job the first week of December. She &amp; our supervisor has a very contentious work relationship &amp; do not associate outside of the office. I asked last week if she wanted to have a going away Luncheon she said not if Laura our supervisor is the host or will be there. Can't say I'm surprised or didn't see this coming. Laura is a micro manager, rude, dismissive of anything that doesn't paint her in a fair light, a liar(I have caught her in numerous lies that impacted how I completed actions), toxic, &amp; refuses to utilize basic human interpersonal skills when addressing those under her supervision. I've watched Laura bait Amber trying to get a reaction in order to use table of consequences to negativity impact her performance evaluation, Amber receiving a negative counseling statement, impacting her bonuses, or time off award. Another reasoning for the contentious feelings is when Amber had a very heated exchange with Laura in which she Amber was accused of botching an action that has handled by the Laura the supervisor previously. Amber pointed this out so Laura then said the previous supervisor did if she didn't botch the action. I walked away as Amber told her she needed to stop blaming everyone for her mistakes &amp; take account(we can track actions so Amber showed Laurashe made the last changes). Laura is jealous of the previous supervisor that left &amp; the close relationship he had with everyone in our office &amp; the organization. Laura gets to the point where she will not allow his name to be mentioned &amp; will go so far as to walk away if he's mentioned by anyone in the organization. So with that background it's no wonder Amber wants nothing to do with Laura, so I asked Amber if she willing to have a farewell dinner outside of work with the people from the office she wants invited. I will coordinate everything via my personal cellphone nothing will be sent via official work email. And I will tell all invited that this is after hours &amp; to not use official work emails to communicate any info I impart about dates &amp; time. We really want to wish Amber farewell but won't be able to if Laura is involved so AITAH for doing this without Laura even though I know it will definitely lead to passive-aggressive retaliation for me &amp; anyone who attends.\",\n",

I was initially uncomfortable at the idea, but we agreed it\\'s fine as long as she gives me advance notice and her parents know where she is. One of the reasons I didn\\'t like the idea at first is that she asks a lot of questions about adult life and such. I consider myself kind of a fuckup, and I was and am still worried that I might be downloading some bad life advice onto her.\\n\\nA few weeks ago she told me that she pretends to be a different person at school, she\\'s part of the \"popular\" clique and says she fakes a lot of her interests and hobbies, because shes worried being honest will get her flagged as a nerd and potentially bullied. Mini-Painting is one of many things she basically tells nobody in her age-circles about. She has one close friends that knows the \"real\" her, but everybody else basically gets the \"curated for popularity\" version of who she is.\\n\\nAfter telling me about it, she asked whether or not she should keep it up. Apparently her dad in particular has been vocal about \"be yourself\" in all situations, and you shouldn\\'t have to fake being a different person at school. I want to stress that I do agree with him in spirit, but as someone who did have a bad school experience, I also know that just being you isn\\'t always easy for teenagers.\\n\\nSo I told her that while its important to find people you can be straightforward with, everybody fakes a public persona to at least some degree. If she feels it keeps the peace and it isn\\'t harming her mentally, it\\'s ultimate up to her how she wants to act at school. Its only another year (Potentially 2) and the people you meet and hang with at school don\\'t have to be the last word on your actual friend circle. I did encourage her to keep a good wire to her one close friend and that some more people she feels can be trusted wouldn\\'t hurt.\\n\\nA few days later, and repeatedtly since then, I have had arguments with her dad about the whole thing. He says that I effectively told a teenage girl to not be herself and by extension am harming her self-image. Her Mom is basically neutral about the whole thing, but daughter has been banned from my place for the foreseeable future.

I called my mom to confirm whether we were expecting anything from overseas relatives. When she confirmed we weren't expecting anything, she called the number provided on the packages. They stated they didn't want it and to do whatever I wanted with it and provided no information. The 3 boxes contained misc items like jars of spices and lots of packaged clothes. I wasn't a fan of the clothes so after putting off the donation for 2 weeks, I dropped off the clothes at a donation box. Today, October 27, my mom called asking if I still had the contents of the boxes and my neighbor called her to say it was theirs and they wanted it back. I told her I either donated or tossed everything. During the evening at 9, I return to my house to see a group of 7 people crowding my yard. They demanded to know what happened to their package and that I essentially stole their stuff. If I wasn't expecting a package then I should've left it outside and I had no right to throw their stuff away. The situation was escalating and they were getting very aggressive. I showed them the shipping label that showed my address on the box but their only concern was I stole their stuff. They threatened to give me 1 day to return their stuff or they would pursue legal action. I had called the cop at this point as they were causing a ruckus and yelling. When the cops arrived they talked to us and our neighbor. That neighbor was accusing us of stealing the expensive jewelry in the boxes. The boxes had no such items and looked to be from a dropshipping company.\\n\\nIn any case, I'm starting to question whether I am at fault. Our neighbor confirmed the phone number on the boxes was hers but during the call, they said they wanted our address to pick up the stuff. Since they lied about the content of the boxes I have little reason to believe in what they say. In hindsight, I could've done other things but what's done is done.

Am I the asshole?\\n\\nedit: I realise now the wording is unclear. The last name on the boxes is the same as mine which is why I asked my mom if we were expecting anything from relatives.

Immediately I told my non-actor boyfriend (15M) that i was auditioning for this character, and i was explaining the characters plot line to him and he immediately went 'no' (if you don't know Nancy is romantically involved with abusive Bill Sikes, she eventually gets beaten to death by him) and i asked why he was uncomfortable with it and his answer was 'i don't want to have to watch you act romantically with someone or get beaten as that would be hard for me to watch.' Which i completely understood- i took time with him to work through it and explain it and i thought that there were only younger people going for Bill Sikes which put him slightly at ease which made him say, 'i won't come and watch but i will run through your lines with you if you get it and do what you need me for to support you.' which, with hindsight, was extremely reasonable- but i was still hurt as he is my best friend and partner and i just want to share all my achievements with him, so him not watching felt wrong.\\n\\nI turned up to auditions, knowing he was prepared for me to get the role- i did, and i got a callback and i was so happy as i never get callbacks or make it this far in the proccess and the idea of playing a lead was slowly within reach but, there was this one boy (16-17M) going for Bill Sikes that I didn't know about and i told my boyfriend and he got so upset because apparently that guy was mean to him and was also older than us and he definitely didn't feel comfortable now with me playing his love interest. (This older guy is basically guaranteed the role- he was by far the best and the oldest which helps for Sikes) He doesn't want me to accept the role (which i still don't know if i got!)

I like to be accommodating and be a good ‚Äúhost‚Äù but it not only takes preparation physically to ensure food, coffee, tidy up etc; but for me it takes a lot mentally and emotionally to just prepare to not have my safe space to myself. I feel like such a jerk but he‚Äôs about just pushing me out of my comfort zone and it honestly just makes it worse and makes me not want to have anyone come at all. I‚Äôm a single mom to two young children and I have a boyfriend (not the father and doesn‚Äôt assist me with kids) and I take care of everything‚Ä¶I‚Äôm in a 24/7 state of overwhelm and overstimulation it feels haha. Is it too much to ask that I know he doesn‚Äôt understand it and I don‚Äôt need him to like it but I need him to respect it and give me a little notice even though it‚Äôs my family? TIA ',\n",

She promised to do her share of the cleaning and groceries, but has yet to deliver. The house has been a mess ever since she moved in and she's bought maybe two food items. I've told her multiple times to clean up her mess, but she says she will do it later and never does it.\\n\\nNow here's where I might have been the asshole : Gem recently came into a large sum of money, which she has been trying to keep a tight secret as she hasn't even told her boyfriend or mother. While we were out, she bought us some drinks, and I asked if she could also get some laundry detergent as we're running out. She refused, saying she needed to save her money, and I got upset. I reminded her of how she said she would contribute to the household and how when I had money, I didn't hesitate to spend it on her. I said I could never count on her for anything.

I have met most of them and I‚Äôve met his parents too. I was trying to be chill about it but Idk why its making me so upset. Its gotten to the point that I have unintentionally been giving him the cold shoulder every time he talks about this party. Am I being too controlling or too jealous? \\n \\nUpdate: For those saying that if he suggested that we‚Äôre matching I should assume I‚Äôm invited right away. He agreed with my comment and said ‚Äúthats true‚Äù ‚ÄúI guess I should just match with my other friends‚Äù. Thats why I assumed that I‚Äôm not invited at all. The reason why I don‚Äôt want to ask him directly either is because I want to avoid coming across as too controlling or needy, but it's hard not to feel upset.\\n\\nUpdate 2: I just had a conversation with him about the party, and he said he didn‚Äôt think to invite me because he thought I‚Äôd feel awkward since I‚Äôm not close with his friends. I told him I‚Äôd like the chance to get to know them better, and he said, ‚ÄúIf you say so, you can go if you want.‚Äù Hearing that response didn‚Äôt help; it felt like he didn‚Äôt genuinely want me there. Now, I‚Äôm stuck. If I go, I‚Äôll feel like an unwelcome guest, but if I don‚Äôt, it could lead to a fight. I‚Äôm at a loss for what to do next.\\n\\nUpdate 3: For those saying I‚Äôm the asshole. Don‚Äôt worry I already decided not to go. He made a group chat for the people invited which I‚Äôm not part of. From this and his other comments he already made it clear he doesn‚Äôt want me there. If he wants it to be just him and his friends then I‚Äôll let them be. \",\n",

Then slams my door and leaves me with yelling puppies.\\n\\nI tried to ignore them, then she comes in a second time, hits me again and says \"fix it\" again, so I got up to see what was wrong and they had #2 in the kennel and walked all in it, there was a blanket over their puppy pad also. Take not, these are NOT my dogs. They where my mother\\'s choice to foster, she said they where her responsibility, they have never been my responsibility.\\n\\nSo I picked up the kennel and put it back in my sister\\'s room, found out the puppies had pooped through the kennel bars on her floor, sister gets up runs to mama in tears and all the sudden she\\'s mad at me, we drag the kennel outside, sister gets to go back to sleep, we get out there she starts screaming at me that I\\'m selfish and self centeted for not fixing it.\\n\\nI told my little sister to let them out before they go to sleep, I told her to. She did not.\\n\\nAfter she says something like \"your sister has to get up in the morning, you do not, your being selfish!\" And I don\\'t think I am? I mean I get not knowing what to do in that situation but she could have asked me for help, if anything I think she should have woke my mother up about this.

Which I don\\'t entirely understand. She constantly says that I do not want a relationship with her when that\\'s not true I\\'ve begged, pleaded, cried, screamed, yelled, asked nicely, literally everything I can think of to try and make it work but it never seems to do anything. She consistently puts it all of me which I understand The relationship works both ways but I feel like She should still be putting effort into it. Im only 16. So she rarely shows up in person, offers a little emotional, and on top of that almost everything financially for me falls on my dad.\\n\\nThe problem hit when she did show up.\\n\\nShe has a habit of taking really bad pictures and posting them, I had just finished my program and I posed for like 3 pictures, and then im trying to figure out what my team is doing she got all upset and was yelling about something and I kinda snapped at her and was like \"Mom not right now I need to focus on my team and what going on I don\\'t want to take pictures\" and she got upset and was like okay Im leaving than. I was a little annoyed/upset and was just frustrated as to why she came at all. Eventually, I figured out what was going on and walked out into the hallway and my mom was still there, we took some more pictures and then she left. Now I knew she\\'d probably post something but to say the least they weren\\'t great and people from my school followed her. When I saw them after the show I was naturally upset and called her and asked her to take them down. She then proceeded to snap at me and get upset when she got home that night she yelled at me and was basically like \"IM your mother I can do whatever I want\" Now I might be the A-hole because in response I went \"Are you? because you don\\'t act like it.\" and I went to my room, she ended up putting the screen recording on my phone and I have currently been resorting to my laptop.\\n\\nHere is where my AITA comes into play, I love my mom I do, BUT I only have so long left before I go off to college and I don\\'t want to spend it walking on eggshells miserable and she only ever hurts me more than she helps. She contributes very little and takes a whole lot more. I think living with my dad would be better for me and it\\'s something I would like to do, I\\'ve considered it for years and it\\'s not like I haven\\'t been with him full time for longer periods before, and I\\'m usually always healthier when Im at my dads.

(EDIT: grammatical errors.)\\n\\nThis past week, my friend group, who I will refer to as Marcy, Kendra, and Wendy (just in case they find this), has been divided. Kendra and I are on the same side, while Wendy and Marcy are on their own side. And just for further context, we are all female, and currently in college.\\n\\nFor the past month, Wendy has been avoiding talking and hanging around me, only coming to me when no one else is available. I saw this as her going through some sort of \"mood,\" but became suspicious when Marcy slowly began to distance herself from Kendra and I. Both me and Kendra hadn\\'t talked to either of them in a while, and on the rare occasion we did have a conversation with either of them, they were standoff-ish, dismissive, or just entirely rude. \\n\\nFinally, just recently, we (Kendra and I) decided to address the elephant in the room. Wendy accused us of \"not valuing our friendship,\" \"stressing them out,\" and \"ridiculing them by calling them fat and ugly.\" Specifically, I was told that I \"Ripped apart the friend group,\" and \"Now that (i\\'ve) made my bed, I gotta lie in it.\" I haven\\'t talked to either Wendy or Marcy in the past 2 weeks.\\n\\nAll my life I haven\\'t been able to keep friends around, and I was open to Wendy and Marcy in about this. I always talked about how much I loved and valued our relationship, and I praised them constantly. I should also mentioned that I never called either of them overweight, especially knowing that Wendy has and ED.\\n\\nIf I think about what I could have  possibly did to either of them, I did tell Kendra that Wendy and Marcy did not keep Kendra in a school club because she wasn\\'t taking her role seriously (They were all in positions of power). I told Kendra this because she was confused about the situation, and I was never explicitly told that that information was confidential. Of course, I shouldn\\'t have done that regardless, and I recognize that now. \\n\\nI can\\'t help but think: Am I the problem here? As I said, i\\'ve lost friends in similar ways before.

She invited two of her coworkers which she ran by me beforehand and I was more than okay with it. I was honestly excited to possibly make some new friends since I don‚Äôt have a ton in the city I‚Äôm currently living in. She painted them as very very chatty people who would talk your ear off, which I was thrilled about because I had hoped that that meant I wouldn‚Äôt have to do a ton of talking to engage in conversation and talking to them would be easy.\\n\\nWhen we went to the show, we arrived early so we could get a good parking spot. Her coworkers (both guys if that‚Äôs important) arrived shortly after. We introduced ourselves to one another and they sat down, making conversation with my Mandy.\\n\\nThey didn‚Äôt seem too interested in talking to me but I just caught that it wasn‚Äôt the vibe and was chill with it.\\n\\nThe show started and we had a great time.

Now idk why she would invite them if that were truly the case. She had mentioned that she thinks both of them have a crush on her so I think that had something to do with it.\\n\\nOnce I got home and had time to think about what she said, I was a little hurt by it.

       " \"AITA for informing a young man of his rights, allowing him to get away before police arrived to search him?  - \\nI'm in the UK, and we have what are called 'community support officers' - AKA 'plastic bobbies'. Basically, they look a bit like uniformed police at a glance, they act a bit like real police officers, but they have very little actual power or authority. Don't have handcuffs, or a baton, no powers of arrest, pretty much glorified security. If they see a crime all they can really do is alert the real police. They act as a deterrent I guess, and save money on real police walking around. \\n\\nSo, as I'm walking through a local estate, I see the local community officer stood with a young lad I recognise as local, who looks pretty nervous. I walk over and ask what's up. The officer informs me they're waiting for the police to arrive as he suspects the lad may have some cannabis on him so they'll be doing a search. I ask him if he's told this lad he has to stay here and wait for them, to which he says yes I've told him he has to wait until the police arrive to conduct a search. So I tell him well you can't hold him here, you know you can't. I turn to the lad and tell him as much, to just leave, now, he can't hold you here, so jog on. He looks a bit unsure, asks if I'm being serious so I say yea, go, quickly now, he's not allowed to hold you here but the police will so leave before they get here. So he does. The community officer and I then have a chat, all friendly, I actually chat with him quite often so we know each other, I've got respect for what they and the police need to do, but I felt like he was keeping the boy there under false pretenses and that's just not on. He tells me I shouldn't have told him he could go, I tell him he shouldn't have not told him. So, given the situation, AITA for letting the lad know his rights, and that he was free to go? \",\n",

We‚Äôre all in a group chat together so that we can still talk if we don‚Äôt have time to hang out in person. This one guy in the gc, who we were all friends with, started saying racist things. Like how white people and other races being together doesn‚Äôt look good, how he wouldn‚Äôt date someone that isn‚Äôt the same race as him, that he doesn‚Äôt find other races attractive, stuff like that. \\n\\n\\nHe‚Äôs mentioned his preferences a few times in the past but I didn‚Äôt say anything about it, because I didn‚Äôt want to cause unnecessary drama. But this time I decided to just be like ‚Äúhey what you‚Äôre saying is kinda hurtful (I‚Äôm not white and I‚Äôm one of the only non-white people) especially since not everyone in this group is white.‚Äù Tried explaining to him how it was hurtful. He got angry/sad/embarassed and left the group chat, then got added back, 2 hours later or so. \\n\\n\\nA few days later he DM‚Äôed me to apologize. He said he was sorry that I felt that way (in regards to being hurt), that he didn‚Äôt think his personal preferences were hurtful and that he thought I don‚Äôt always get sensitive like other people, that I shouldn‚Äôt take it personally, and that it‚Äôs not his fault because his family raised him that way. I personally don‚Äôt think that saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you feel that way‚Äù is a real/sincere apology, so I got angry and responded in a not so great way. Basically I said ‚Äúsure whatever that‚Äôs fine just leave me alone, I‚Äôm already having a bad day.‚Äù Which was true tbh.\\n\\n\\nThen life went on, like a few weeks or so. One of our friends told me that they tried explaining to him how what he said was wrong, but he got angry again and blocked a few of us. Including me. So they decided to compromise and move on because he‚Äôs not going to change his mind. I told them, what he said was hurtful and it‚Äôs hurtful that you guys would move on just because he won‚Äôt change his mind. That he needs to learn how to accept constructive criticism. They then told me I need to move on from the situation. \\n\\n\\nJust three days ago, I left the group chat and blocked most of them because I was frustrated and sad that they took him back, and also what they said.

A bathroom was installed downstairs so that we all wouldn't have to share that space. (I have an 8 yr old) The upflush tank is for the toilet, shower, and a basin sink outside the bathroom.\\n\\nThere is no lease. A family member owns the house but it was purchased for my child and I, and for the future/in the will. I let Sis &amp; BIL move in once they had their baby because they needed to get on their feet. Now 4 yrs later I am DONE with not only this issue but so many others.\\n\\nI pay 50% of mortgage and 50% utils, while they each make more than I do, and together only have 50% of the mortgage, and 50% utils. BIL just spent over 3K on a trip to see family. Meanwhile, I still have to share my bathroom because they won't fix theirs. I do all the yard work, house repairs, clean their messes (and stare at their pile of junk) in the garage. Just examples from many issues.\\n\\nThey broke the upflush tank months after it was installed, because a bolt felt down their sink drain. And they are not keeping the plug in the sink drain to avoid this. I paid in full almost $600 to get it fixed because they were dragging their feet.\\n\\nNow the tank is broken again. This time, a bobby pin was lodged in the fan inside the tank. Unlike last time, the motor is burnt out with them trying to fix themselves, so it's approx $1500 to replace/install. It's been 6 months and they still have not fixed it. I told them I'm not paying a DIME, as they were responsible for the damage. This means they are in my space to do dishes (at very late times when im trying to relax) and using my bathroom.\\n\\nHowever, they have been using my things, going through TP without contributing, the shower gets filthy now. One time I found many many hairs ALL OVER the tub if you know what I mean, with MY scissors on the edge of the tub and my razor used. I was disgusted, and had to clean it up because she didn't!! My things get rearranged or go missing, everything knocked off my shower shelves with all the stuff in the bottom of the tub. I also have a kitten, so for now the litter box is in the bathroom until it's older. They just move it into the living room, complaining they don't like it in there when they shower. It's cleaned regularly, and they also got a kitten who is mostly upstairs in my space (not by my preference) and uses the litter box too. They haven't once helped change the Litterbox their kitten also uses, just shove it outside because they're too good to shower with it in there or clean it if they don't like it. \\n\\nWIBTA if I gave them a date and said after that date I am installing a lock on the bathroom door?? This is in the hopes of getting them to fix the tank they broke so they can use their bathroom again. Is it illegal if there is no lease but just family members not wanting to pay up for their carelessness? \\n\\nI am feeling trapped in my home due to this amongst many other things.

We have been through everything together and also we both have kids. Mine is a lot older than her with my youngest being 7 and her only son being age 3. Well we recently got into our first huge fight where I did ask for a favor dealing with my child because it was a family emergency and i had no other help and i didnt want him to be alone and she did not help. I did talk to her about this issue and other issues where I have noticed she has never really been there physically for me when I need her the most or any big life moments of mine or with my kids like birth, baby showers,  etc. I have also never asked her for physical favors in the 11 years. Mind you I have done a lot for her and her son. I always helped her whenever I can. I grew to love her son like a nephew and he calls me auntie. Well due to this argument,  I decided that we should take a best friend break until she realizes what she has done and apologies or until I get tired of waiting for her to own up.

She knew that I wanted to get these covered and I would when it would be a good time for me. \\n\\nNow I‚Äôm 17 and decided with the cooler weather out and the fact I would be wearing regular shirts and jackets I decided that now would be a good time to get it covered since I could have it properly heal without getting hot from wearing long sleeves and full shirts that would protect it from the sun. I found an artist that I found trusted because she had done multiple of my friend‚Äôs work and they were all so beautiful. I went to get the tattoo done and it came out absolutely beautiful. I got a lotus flower because it is one of my favorite flowers. Light and I haven‚Äôt talked since early August and that was because I reached out first. We don‚Äôt speak often and don‚Äôt unless I reach out first. In September, her brother reached out saying that it was f‚Äôed up and saying I was disrespectful since I got her tattoo covered up saying that I should have asked her. I shut it down real quick and said that I have talked to her about it and we haven‚Äôt talked in months. I told him that she should have reached out to me and I was not going to be communicating through him. Her and I haven‚Äôt talked had problems because and I‚Äôve distanced myself from her quite a bit because she has always been kind of off. Things like leaving me out when we have another friend over, her always having to be the center of attention, storming off when I talk to someone else for more than a minute, giving backhanded compliments, putting me down, etc. I have found it not enjoyable to be around her and therefore I have not. She is almost 18 years old and she still asked like she did when we first met in 2019. I‚Äôve been thinking about this more lately because her birthday is coming up and I do want to reach out but I don‚Äôt know if that would be a good idea. AITA? ',\n",
       " \"AITA For not letting my GF win in a card game? - Happened earlier today at my regular card shop with some friends.\\n\\nFor context: My Girlfriend and I started playing Lorcana in July-I have previous TCG experience in YuGiOh back in 2013-2017 but got back recently in 2023 since my favorite archetype was getting support (Raidraptors woo), but this her first TCG. She's gotten better since we first started and we have close games at times, but I typically win due to deckbuilding/decision-making, and would occasionally&lt;&gt;frequently remind her of effects she may miss/misinterpret which is understandable and I'm okay with helping her. At the local shop they run Lorcana pretty casually so regardless if you win/lose you get 'points', but I still like to be competitive and try. When I get locked in I have the habit of RBF, which is good for competition but catches her off guard sometimes. When we usually play each other, if I were to realize she has game, I would tell her so we could get into the next game quickly.\\n\\nNow for the story: We are 1-1 in a best of 3, and she is in a position to win if she 'quests' (gains points) with all of her characters currently on the board. I notice this during my previous turn and I didn't want to show it via my face so I kept a blank expression. However she did not see her winning board and instead did 3-4 actions/moves until she finally realized, and asked if she could take them back so she could win. Because I wanted to win, I said no, sarcastically saying that she made too many moves and couldn't reset it even though we really could have. She started to get upset but played along a bit, making comments to my other friends sitting next to us saying how mean I was for taking it so seriously, which made me feel like an ass even though she missed her win condition. I doubled down on not resetting her turn and when it got to mine, I ended up having the exact number of points on my field for the win and took the game/match. After a little she got up to use the bathroom and was gone for 5 minutes, and when she came back her eyes were a little watery, but she kept herself composed, and we played some other people before heading home. In my head I was beating myself up over it, but part of me was coping that by not being as lenient, that it'd help her be a better player to check her board/effects like how I've experienced when learning to play TCGs especially modern YuGiOh (it's awful). We talked in the car and she said she wasn't upset at me, moreso at herself for not counting her field, telling me she'd excused herself after the last game as to not cry in front of people due to her tending to let out her emotions through crying and didn't want to embarass herself/me. After talking through it/communicating our feelings we made up and everything is okay/settled.\\n\\nNow, for the question: Was I the asshole for not letting her reset her turn to win the game?\",\n",

She‚Äôd only had one relationship in middle school and complained about wanting a boyfriend. I knew she found Alan attractive, so I asked him what he thought.

       " \"WIBTA if I donate to my ex-wife's gofundme for her (formerly our) cat? - My ex-wife and I divorced about two years ago after being together for about 10 years. It was a really rough divorce. I won't get too into it here but we had many problems through our entire marriage, some from her, most from me if I'm being honest. Near the end I had an emotional affair which was the final nail in the coffin. We've been no contact ever since, years of radio silence. It was a long, rough couple years but I would say I'm mostly healed now. I never tried to contact her ever, no matter how tempted I was to write her an apology. But I'm ashamed to admit that once a month or so I check in on a tiktok account she made for our (now her) pets, a dog and two cats. I just need to see if they're doing okay. I look at the page, confirm they're still alive and healthy, and I exit the page. I know this isn't really okay or healthy for me, but I've never tried to contact her so I'm not harming her. Unfortunately somethings changed and I don't know what to do.\\n\\nWhen I checked the page yesterday, there was a new pinned post concerning one of the cats, we'll call him Oliver. Oliver has always had urinary tract problems, and occasionally kidney stones, but it seems recently he's had more severe issues and my ex-wife has incurred a 4000 dollar vet bill getting him treatment. If he doesn't get better he'll possibly need an 8000 dollar surgery or be put down. My ex-wife has started a gofundme to cover the 4000 dollar bill, she says any extra will go toward the surgery. As you can imagine, she's not getting too much, a few hundred dollars from friend and family total over the last couple weeks. \\n\\nNow I think under normal circumstances she'd want me to stay as far away from her as possible. And I'm 50/50 on if she'd take any money from me even if it's just for the cat. But I straight up can't stand by and do nothing. I love that cat so, so much, and even though things ended badly between us I have always wished the best for my ex-wife. The idea of just sitting here on my ass while the cat we adopted together dies and she takes the financial burden on all by herself just makes me so upset that I can't stop crying. I sent her a text trying to reach out asking for permission to donate, which terrified me but I didn't know what else to do. I have no doubt I'm long blocked, even if I'm not there has been no response so far. \\n\\nNow I've thought of a way to donate completely anonymously by using gift cards, but that just feels weird. But donating normally and her seeing it's from me also feels like a terrible idea. And of course, just doing nothing feels the most wrong of all to me. WIBTA if I donate in any case?\",\n",

My mom constantly has smug remarks about what I eat and about my body, that since I was 11. For exemple, I loved eating a nutella toast after souper instead of a normal desert, and each time I did she would look at me with a judgmental look and say: \\n\\n\"You should take more veggies if your still hungry, you shouldn\\'t eat all that sugar if you want to stay thin\"\\n\\n or : \\n\\n\"You\\'re eating again?

Laura got upset and started crying like she usually does and called me an \"arrogant know-it-all.\" I couldn\\'t help but laugh (I usually do in uncomfortable situations). Her husband backed her up, saying I had no idea what it‚Äôs like to raise a kid. But honestly, I couldn‚Äôt just sit back and be complicit in this any longer. They need to hear the truth!\\n\\nNow, my parents are caught in the middle and think I was too harsh and are threatening to kick me out, which would *literally* make me homeless. They‚Äôre saying I should have kept my mouth shut and just enjoyed dinner. But I feel like if I don‚Äôt say something, who will? Will no one stand up for what\\'s right anymore? AITA for standing up for what I believe is right, or should I have just let it go?',\n",

This also sits out on the counter \\n\\nThey look like this: https://imgur.com/gallery/ki1xjwl\\n\\nI‚Äôm sure you can sense where this is going. Over the weekend I‚Äôd eaten some spicy Thai food, which you know, has its own downsides. Monday, I‚Äôm going about my business and finish with a cleaning foam wipe. All of a sudden things are on fire back there. I assume it‚Äôs because of the Thai food so I‚Äôm uncomfortable but what could I do about it. I stand up and walk away. Now the burning has increased and it‚Äôs starting to sting. I‚Äôm in a lot of pain. The Thai food was spicy but it wasn‚Äôt so spicy that it should be causing this kind of a reaction. Unfortunately for me, I have to get on a video call with my boss. I‚Äôve got no chance to do anything else but writhe in pain for the next 30 minutes. \\n\\nIt wasn‚Äôt until later that day when I go to help my kid with their teeth that I see the toothpaste uncapped on the counter.

       " \"TIFU by giving my dad a reverse mohawk when he was pushing me to cut his hair. - So my mum has been pushing me and my dad to get our hair cut recently. Neither of our hair is as long as we usually have it by the time we get it cut. My dad decided he didn't want to pay for a hairdresser to do it and got me to do it instead.\\n\\nToday was going pretty normally until my dad asked me to cut his hair, which was fine, I have done it once or twice before, particularly once in the pandemic. He was being pretty pushy about getting it done early today but it's whatever, that's kinda what he's like. \\n\\nSo I ended up doing it in our back garden, got the back and the ears done, really just needed to trim down the top of his hair a bit and he would have been done probably. \\n\\nNow my dad is in his 60's and he's gone grey, but his hair growth has not slowed down significantly, he still grows it at a decent rate. That's important for this next bit.\\n\\nAlso probably worth noting I'm probably a little autistic, and care a lot less than most people about what random people on the street think, butttt I was thinking he's retired, he's not got to go to anything too important, anytime soon... Fuck it sounds like a good time to play a bit of a practical joke on him... \\n\\n*So I put the shaver at the top of his head, and shaved straight forwards*\\n\\nIt was funny in the moment, it really was, buuuuut after a couple of seconds he realised the significance of it and reminded me that he is going on holiday for a week in a few weeks, which I had forgotten about...\\n\\nSo he told me to get my mum to try and fix it, so I sent her down and tbh I think she laughed for longer than I did, I don't think I've ever heard her laugh so hard. But after she stopped laughing and I came downstairs to try and help it was immediately clear that he was pretty upset by the whole thing, even crying which is maybe the 3rd time I've ever seen him cry, which really pissed my mum off for obvious reasons.\\n\\nAfter I left them to it again, she talked with a few friends who have relatives who are hairdressers and unsurprisingly, he probably has to go bald really. He might have not minded being bald, had he had a choice in the matter, but he definitely did not like the idea of it when i suggested it not long after. \\n\\nMy mum told me to get out and get my hair done at a hairdressers before they do the same to me, which he might not be willing to do but she definitely would. \\n\\nSo that's where I'm going right now. Thinking of having mine cut particularly short as a bit of an apology. \\n\\nHe should be fine, apparently average hair growth is half a inch per month, so give it a month and it'll just look short, by Christmas it should look neat.\\n\\nMistakes were made.\\n\\nTldr: dad asked me to cut hair, but he didn't like the haircut I gave him, so he's opting to probably go bald instead.\",\n",

This time around we decided to take things slow and be friends.  As it turns out we are best friends and get along great.  \\n\\nYesterday after work he came by to take care of me because I wasn‚Äôt feeling well.  He made me dinner and we laid in bed watching tv.  I finally started to feel better and asked if he wanted a back rub as a reward for doting on me the last few days.  He enthusiastically agreed.  \\n\\nI just treated myself to new lotion from bath and body works so I grabbed the bottles and had him smell them to pick his favorite.  It was dark, the only light was from the tv.  I slathered him with the lotion thick because it smelled so good. Gave him an amazing back rub and we both fell asleep.  \\n\\nThis morning at 6 am he woke up realizing he fell asleep at my place, and was late for work.  Not wanting to wake me he got up and threw on clothes in the dark and left.  \\n\\nA side note is he is a foreman for a large tree company.  He works with a bunch of dudes and they are all manly and will tease each other endlessly.  \\n\\nWhen I finally woke up, I was confused because it looked like my hands were covered in gold sparkly paint.  I finally figured it out that for some reason the lotion had thick gold glitter in it.  \\n\\nI text him to alert him that he was covered in very noticeable glitter but I was too late, the boys have already noticed.  It‚Äôs two hours into his work day and the teasing as only just began.  He messaged me back that this probably makes us official as the crew will never let him live this down and I‚Äôve officially marked my territory.  \\n\\nTLDR- gave my situationship a back rub in the dark not realizing the new lotion I used has lots of glitter in it, he woke up late, threw on clothes, and went to work covered in very noticeable gold glitter.  \\n\\nEdit: apparently glowtion = glitter lotion.

       " 'TIFU by not turning all of my electronics off before bed - tldr at the bottom.  This happened about a decade ago, and something else I was just reading reminded me of it so I thought I\\'d share.\\n\\nI had just moved into a new place about a week prior.  I was renting a bedroom in a small house, and the only other person who lived there was the owner.  It was a great setup for me, because his work schedule and social life meant I was often the only person home.  As such, for the first time in years, my music-loving self could set up a decent pair of speakers and a subwoofer and listen to music at levels that would be pretty inconsiderate in a shared space, but not screamingly loud or anything.  Well, the subwoofer itself was pretty much turned all the way up, but that\\'s because it was much smaller than the other speakers, so that was how I got it to be at an appropriate match.  This setup was in my bedroom, not a shared space.\\n\\nOne night, I was listening to music while lying in bed.  It turned into one of those nights where I went from wired to tired pretty quickly, and so I just hit the remote for the stereo to turn it off before passing out.  That doesn\\'t turn the subwoofer off, but whatever, I\\'m not worried about the couple of pennies it\\'ll cost to keep that thing running overnight.  \\n\\nI was worried, however, at about 2:00AM when I suddenly heard someone screaming in my bedroom.  In my utterly discombobulated state, it took me a few seconds to realize that the screaming was coming through my subwoofer.  I double checked, and my stereo was off.  \\n\\nAs I relayed this to someone at work the next day, they asked where my new place was.  When I told them, they started laughing.  They said \"when you go home tonight, take a look at the house next to yours.  And take a look at their back yard.\"\\n\\nI get home that night, and what do I find?  Behind their modest ranch house is a 30\\' tall antenna mast that apparently everyone in town knew about except for me.  Turns out the guy is an amateur radio hobbyist who loved playing with CB and ham radio equipment.  And my crappy thrift-store subwoofer was picking up his transmissions because of the way things were wired.  \\n\\n*tl;dr - left a subwoofer on overnight and was jarred awake by the sound of an amateur radio hobbyist next door screaming through the speaker*',\n",
       " 'TIFU by standing outside of my situationship‚Äôs apartment waiting for her to come home so I could convince her to not leave me. Now I feel like a disgusting creep and I‚Äôll never speak to or go near her again - So, for context, we had known eachother for only a short time before this, but the relationship between us had developed very quickly and you could possibly even have called it ‚Äùlove at first sight‚Äù. \\n\\nThen some complications appeared, because she had been planning to move to a different country in under a year‚Äôs time, which shook me a lot. I felt very depressed about the fact that me and her could never last, but I still wanted to experience knowing her even if it was only for a few months. The feeling was not mutual.\\n\\nSo today, after our relationship had started falling apart a couple of days ago, I decided to go wait outside her apartment for her to come home. My thoughts prior to this were just to talk to her, straighten everything out between us, decide what we‚Äôre gonna do going forward and then maybe say our goodbyes and never speak again. \\n\\nMy mistake, however, was that I had not thought at all about how it‚Äôs gonna feel like to her to see me standing outside of her house unannounced if our feelings about talking aren‚Äôt mutual. I was so blinded by my feelings for her that I hadn‚Äôt thought about the possibility that she doesn‚Äôt want to see me again.\\n\\nSo she walked to her street and we met. Our conversation was very short and didn‚Äôt really have any meaning. The whole time she looked so uncomfortable and scared, and at that point it started to sink in what I really had done. She just finished the conversation quickly and walked inside.\\n\\nI instantly felt sick to my stomach thinking about what had just happened. I had really just stood outside someones house imagining that my romantic feelings we‚Äôre going to be mutual with that person. I feel so terrible about the fact that I probably made her fear for her life or for her wellbeing by just wanting to talk to her. This goes against everything and anything I have ever thought or expected of myself and I feel absolutely disgusting right now. I can‚Äôt believe I have actually done something like this.\\n\\nEven though my meaning really was only to talk to her and have a discussion about how we‚Äôre gonna end things between us, I can‚Äôt help but to feel like an absolute creep and harasser.

I can not believe I could make someone feel that way and not even think about it as a possibility beforehand. I feel like a creep, a stalker, and a harasser, and I don‚Äôt know if I will ever forgive myself for doing something so stupid like this.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nI wanted to talk to my situationship but ended up looking like a creepy stalker because of my own stupidity and ignorance.',\n",

       " 'TIFU by sleeping at the gate. - So it was night time and I had a short 1 hour flight for some errands. I arrived at the airport early too and mostly relaxed and crashed around the area especially after going through TSA. However, I did not get enough good sleep the night prior as I had so much work on my plate. Since I was off work, I mostly relaxed and used my laptop treating it as a nice evening/night to unwind as there was not much going on the week for me. Closer to the boarding time, I arrived at the gate and took a seat to wait to board for my flight. Now usually, I am good about waking up right just when my boarding group is called and so when the urge to nap came, I started napping being completely forgetful of the fact that I was already exhausted and that I am at a \"quiet terminal\".  I then woke up at the airport to that my gate was empty and then checked the time to see that the time was 30 minutes past the departing time of my flight. Now, had this been an international flight, I probably would have been panicking but luckily it wasn\\'t. I wasn\\'t exactly going to go through the hassle of trying to get a flight rebooked with a gate agent for something that was my own fault so I had simply booked a last minute flight that was 8 hours later in the morning which was not that expensive and it was even with the same airline. I ended up continuing to sleep at the airport as a result internally facepalming myself over the extreme stupidity of what I had done and then woke up a bit earlier to prepare to board for my new flight this time and finally made it on my way.  Surprisingly, my return flight was not cancelled for being a no-show for the original outbound flight and I was even able to board and go on my way back home on the original return flight (and funnily enough, I ended up just sleeping for most of the flight and woke up just in time for descent). But yeah, still was rather perplexed by my own stupidity and definitely will probably be putting various alarms right around boarding time in case I snooze off.\\n\\nTL;DR: Overslept at my boarding gate and ended up missing the flight.',\n",

       " 'TIFU by poisoning myself... from Nuts - Today I fucked up. \\n\\nObligatory not today, but recently (for the past 2 months) I\\'ve been dealing with a host of random health issues. Being in my mid-twenties and always having had an easy time with my health it was honestly super strange. I had the distinct thought, \"Damn, this is what 24 is like huh?\" \\n\\nThe symptoms included diarrhea, difficulty breath, headaches, difficultly sleeping, difficulty thinking, and worst of all was an awful rash that started on every joint and would constantly be flaring up painfully everyday. I genuinely struggled with work in a way I hadn\\'t in months, and these symptoms lasted 2 months.\\n\\nThe main symptom that really grabbed me was the rash, and as such I got first lotion on it since it sort of looked like dry skin. After 2 weeks of no progress, I moved on to an over the counter cream for anti-fungal and hydrocortisone. While the cortisone did help with the itch, it did nothing to stop the painful spread of the infection. After that I went to my pharmacist, and got some more creams that would help. They did not. \\n\\nIt wasn\\'t until another week after trying those creams (almost 2 months from onset of symptoms) that I figured out what was going on from the most unlikely place. \\n\\nI don\\'t watch Dr. House, but occasionally on YouTube Shorts I will be recommended clips from the show. During the clip that engrossed me on the toilet, Dr. House was chastising another doctor for not realizing the difference between Brazil and Bolivia, and that their patient was suffering from Selenium Poisoning from Brazil Nuts. \\n\\nTurns out that the maximum amount of Selenium that an adult should take in before having signs of toxicity is only 400 micrograms a day. Each nut has roughly 100 micrograms of Selenium. I was eating 12 a day because I\\'d heard they were good for testosterone production, and the Trader Joe\\'s bag I\\'d bought had a serving size of a quarter cup (which is over the healthy limit). \\n\\nNow a few days after of no longer putting nuts in my mouth, I feel loads better and most of my symptoms have largely disappeared. \\n\\nI\\'m honestly making this post to hopefully save others from the same mistake, and to bring attention to the issue. I have a hard time that Trader Joe\\'s suppliers who grow these for a living don\\'t know the present and real danger the food possesses if eaten more than 2-3 nuts a day. I tried to give them feedback on the product to help them improve, but they\\'ve ignore my request for a week now and I thought others should know. \\n\\nTL;DR: I got a huge host of medical issues randomly, and turns out it was because I was eating my \"healthy snacks\". Brazil nuts can quickly poison you if consumed more than a 1-3 nuts daily, and Trader Joe\\'s recommends eating 30+ on their packaging. \\n\\nEdited to add: I had originally said 30 nuts is a quarter cup, but was only doing that based on some incorrect nutrition site. People pointed out the error in the comments and broke down the math. It\\'s still unhealthy with the amount recommended in the serving size. ',\n",

Other than that and not particularly wanting to be near me, he talked normally, except whenever we were alone together when it was dead silence. In two words, very awkward.\\n\\nApparently my second fuck up was my trying to sit next to him in the car for the drive to the state park, which I admit, yeah, a not insignificant part was me wanting to sit next to him. But also because a large part of it was because there were four of us trying to cram four people\\'s and one small dog\\'s worth of camping shit into a goddamn compact crossover with a trunk the size of a postage stamp. I\\'m a small person, and if you put me in the middle seat, there\\'d have been *sooo* much more space in the empty seat next to me for stuff, but M insisted I didn\\'t need to. Instead I spent the four hour roundtrip squashed up against the car door, unable to move an inch, because his shit and other random shit was falling into me from the middle seat, in addition to various heavy articles sitting on top of my feet and cutting off their circulation.\\n\\nFast forward to when we\\'re all back home. M doesn\\'t talk to me for a week. He doesn\\'t get on voice chat when I\\'m online in voice chat. I start panicking because anxiety and I\\'m terrified I offended him. I message him and ask him if I make him uncomfortable. No response for two days. I talk to my other friend (28M), I\\'ll call him G, who went on the camping trip with us and asked him if he knew what I did to make M uncomfortable. I was already starting to spiral, and I forgot that G has a tendency to blab while also grossly exaggerating or twisting around things other people said/did. G told me M was annoyed with me constantly putting myself down and talking about sad/depressing things in my life during the whole trip.\\n\\nI had no idea I was even doing it. I thought I was just being myself, and I thought everybody had a good time because everybody said afterward they had a good time, including M. I struggle with body-focused anxiety, body dysmorphia, and PTSD from being bullied/abused in school. Every day is a fight not to let the bad thoughts win. I\\'m trying my hardest. G also said I made M uncomfortable by trying to sit next to him in the car, that he took it as an advance toward him. I had no idea any of this was going on because M said nothing to me about it the whole trip.\\n\\nThen the huge fuckup... I had a mental breakdown and went off on M. I sent him several angry messages asking why he didn\\'t just tell me I made him uncomfortable, sarcastically apologizing for not handling my depression as well as he does, and accusing him of being a hypocrite for being annoyed by my depression, because he constantly, *constantly*, makes jokes about offing himself and I say nothing, even though it makes me and G\\'s spouse very uncomfortable, because that\\'s his \"coping mechanism\". Worst of all, I told M never to talk to me again and unfriended him on everything. I instantly regretted it next morning because M doesn\\'t like confrontation and basically shuts off whenever there\\'s conflict, so I knew he wouldn\\'t even try to respond. I talked to G\\'s spouse, and they were angry at G for sticking his nose into everyone\\'s business and reminded me that G has problems with that and twisting information and that I need to have a conversation with M about it.\\n\\nAfter spending the day alternately sobbing, panicking and hating myself, I messaged him apologizing for yelling at him and said I jumped to too many conclusions based on what G said. I was so sure that M would never talk to me, so I got all my (false?) information from G, when instead I should\\'ve just waited and talked to M. Or waited and did nothing instead of going ballistic. M hasn\\'t been online at all in two days. I just hope he\\'s okay.\\n\\nTL;DR: I made my friend uncomfortable during a group camping trip, and instead of waiting and talking to him about it, I went and got a bunch of misinformation about it, yelled at him for being a hypocrite, and now he probably won\\'t talk to me ever again.',\n",
       " \"TIFU by peeing in a cup - To preface this, I'm currently living in the dorms at university, and I have a single.  Even though there's 5 people in the suite, there's only one bathroom with one toilet.  Often times, I can't hold it in, and there will be like a 30 minute wait because somehow my suitemates will always be in the bathroom when I have to use it.  I also sometimes don't feel like getting fully dressed just to go to the bathroom, especially at night.  Due to this, I sometimes pee in bottles and throw them away later.  This particular time, however, there wasn't any bottles for me to pee in, so I used the next best thing: a plastic cup from the cafeteria.  I didn't think there'd be any problem; I simply planned to empty the cup in the toilet during the middle of the night; that was, until the fire alarm sounded.  I assumed it was a drill, so I quickly threw on some clothes, but then I remembered that during fire drills, you get in trouble if you're still in your dorm, which means they had to check, which in turn meant they would see the pee cup.  I panicked, and immediately came up with the only solution that I thought would be quick enough and discrete enough.  \\n\\nI drank the pee cup.\\n\\nWhile drinking, I gagged a litttle towards the end and a little ended up on my shirt.  I threw on a sweatshirt to hide the splatter before finally exiting my dorm and making my way outside the building.  \\n\\nAs it turned out, though, it wasn't a fire drill at all, but an actual triggering of the fire alarm due to an incident with a microwave.  That means they didn't check the dorms and wouldn't have seen the pee cup anyways. \\n\\nI chugged my own pee for no reason.\\n\\ntl;dr I peed in a cup, and to make sure it wasn't seen during a dorm check that ultimately didn't happen, I chugged the pee in the cup.  \",\n",
       " \"TIFU by realizing popcorn ceiling has asbestos - As a kid I would sleep on the top bunk of the bed. My parents thought I was the smarter one and was worried that my younger brother would roll off. Because I was on the top bunk, I got to put up those cool glow in the dark stars, but I would also be able to touch the ceiling. Our house was built in the 1950s and it had a popcorn ceiling. I would pick at the ceiling and sometimes small pieces of the popcorn would come off. Because it's called popcorn, I would eat it. It didn't really taste like anything really. I think I have an oral fixation because I would also randomly chew and eat things like paper lollipop sticks. A friend made a joke about asbestos today and told me that it's been used to make popcorn ceilings. I knew that asbestos was used to make the snow in wizard of oz, but not ceilings??? I no longer live in that house and currently don't have a popcorn ceiling. But I can't remember really how much asbestos I consumed. It was just little bits here and there and I didn't create a noticeable mark on the ceiling. At least I thought it wasn't noticeable. Not sure what the long term affects are. I'm still alive and no cancer yet.  \\n\\nTL;DR: I was a dumb kid that ate asbestos \\n\\n\",\n",

My first thought was that he was going to ask if I could make something for him, which is something I\\'m used to, but instead he comes back and starts explaining that his daughter is currently going to school for graphic design. I said that\\'s awesome and he asked if I could do him a favor and wait a moment while he called her, I said yes. \\n\\nThis is where things got messy.

Sorry for formatting, etc. I'm on mobile and upset. \\n\\n\\nSo I just got fired from my job (for no reason except that a colleague hates me and she's been here longer than me) in a foreign country I moved to for my bf. Meaning I don't really have much of a support system here and have to leave the country if I don't work. I immediately texted my bf about it but couldn't take any of his calls afterward because I still was required to end my shift. When I got home I pretty much immediately went to bed.\\n\\nWe don't live together but he has a key and came over later that evening. By the time he was here I was awake but felt empty and like nothing mattered anymore. I was completely paralyzed.\\n\\nNow for some reason when he came in he didn't greet me or anything, just saw the lights were out and assumed I was sleeping I guess? And waited in another room. He came in every 10 Minutes or so to look after me but didn't say anything, so I also didn't say anything and I just felt ignored and became more irritated the longer he stayed without doing anything. \\n\\nAt some point he realised I was awake and tried talking to me. I was still feeling many negative things, yet nothing at all and couldn't deal with anything anymore, so I shut everything down and just kept telling him that I've got nothing to say, nothing makes sense and he should leave, to the point I actually offered him money just to leave me alone. He finally concluded that I must be suicidal (he knows I used to be a while before we got together) and got scared I would do something horrible if I left (which admittedly I did and sometimes still do consider - but I'm a coward and would never actually act on it). There was a lot of back and forth that ended in me luring him out of my flat and stealing my keys back so he couldn't get back in. He obviously was very worried and I heard trough my window that he called friend before he went home. I fell asleep shortly after. \\n\\nIt's now the evening of the next day and I still haven't taken any of his calls. I have also received several texts and calls from mutual friends and his mom. I can't pick up or answer, I'm not sure why, guess I'm still paralyzed and in denial, haven't been able to really process anything. And now a bunch of people now about something I haven't even fully realised myself and think I'm dead or something. Also I'm incredibly confused that my bf is so worried that he tells everyone about it, except actual authorities who could do something about someone actually being suicidal??? Like if he thinks I'm dead why doesn't he call an ambulance/police or something? Not that any of this is his fault, he's a wonderful person and  must be devestated, but getting mad about weird details takes my mind off other things. \\n\\nI know what I did/I'm doing is terrible and I don't know what to do. I'm sure if he had just hugged me, I would've snapped out of it and none of this would've happened. But it's not his job to fix me and read my mind. I think there is no coming back and I ruined our relationship forever. There's no way he could or should trust me again after this. Also everyone he knows now knows about my problems and thinks I'm crazy and/or dead. I'm thinking of just burning all bridges, move to my home country and start over. He doesn't deserve this. \\n\\n\\nTLDR: Lost my job in a foreign country, told my bf, who just wanted to help, some depressing thoughts and made him leave.

       " \"TIFU by oversleeping on my day off. - I (27NB) took today off work to drive my partner (32NB) to an appointment. My partner had an appointment at 10am for an EEG at a hospital roughly 40 minutes from where my partner and I live.\\nFor the EEG, my partner needs to have extremely clean hair. This is because the test uses electrodes on the scalp to measure brain activity. The only way to achieve this is for my partner to shower right before we leave for the appointment.\\n\\nMy partner is a nocturnal individual and usually sleeps from 7am to between 1pm and 3pm, so I was expected to wake them up early enough to get ready and drive them to the appointment. Normally I wake up at 6am for work, so this should not have been a problem.\\nI have been consistently required to work on job sites downtown starting between 7:30am and 8am nearly every workday for several weeks. Sleeping in has not been an option, at all.\\n\\nRecently, due to my severe asthma and possible sleep apnea (unverified), I have been struggling with sleeping through the night. I have been tired constantly and often sleep through a large part of the weekend. Seasonal issues are not fun. It gets to my partner too, as they have very bad hay fever, in addition to mild asthma.\\n\\nToday, I overslept and didn't wake up until after 9am. I suspect that my half asleep self thought my 8am alarm was my 6am alarm and dismissed it. Because I overslept, I didn't wake my partner up on time and they had to call the hospital to reschedule the test.\\n\\nNow, whatever is wrong with their brain is going to take an extra few weeks to be diagnosed. They've been struggling and their neurologist is concerned. It's going to take longer to get the help they need because I overslept. \\nI stayed in bed more than 3 hours late and delayed my partner's access to treatment for potentially life threatening neurological issues. They needed me and I was asleep. \\n\\nIf whatever is wrong in their brain gets worse, or even becomes fatal because of the delay, it will be my fault. My fault; their quality of life DEGRADED BECAUSE OF ME. I made life worse for the person I love most. I have failed as a partner and I'll never be able to make up for it! Never! \\nI fucked up when they needed me the most. I don't know if my partner will ever forgive me, which they probably shouldn't, but I don't think it will ever be possible to forgive myself.\\n\\n\\nTLDR; My partner missed an extremely important medical procedure because I couldn't get my ass out of bed.\",\n",

I don‚Äôt know what to do. - So, I (22M) matched with this beautiful girl (22F) on Hinge last week. She was the one who commented on my profile first, and I matched with her back because she‚Äôs gorgeous. For context, we‚Äôre both in Southern California. She‚Äôs currently pursuing her master‚Äôs degree, while I‚Äôve recently graduated with my bachelor‚Äôs and now have a full-time job.\\n\\nHere‚Äôs how everything played out. We met in person for the first time during a weeknight at an outdoor mall restaurant. We hugged when we saw each other, had a good meal, and got to know each other a bit. Afterward, we saw Smile 2, a horror movie, and ended up cuddling in the theater. The first date went really well‚Äîwe broke the touch barrier, and she seemed to enjoy my company, laughing at my jokes and staying close to me.\\n\\nOur second date was two days later, on Friday night, and it was even better. I won‚Äôt go into too much detail, but we ate out, went to the beach, and spent the whole evening together. By this point, we were really comfortable with each other, and I could tell she was attracted to me. After dinner, we got some food to-go near her place (I was the one driving since she lives with a roommate, and I live with my parents). She suggested eating at her apartment, and I agreed.\\n\\nAt her place, we ate, made out, cuddled, and then she fell asleep in my arms‚Äîher head resting on my chest and her leg draped over me. It felt amazing. I ended up spending the entire weekend with her.\\n\\nSaturday and Sexual Anxiety\\nOn Saturday, we had an incredible time. We took pictures, went to a pumpkin patch, visited the zoo, ate good food, and caught another movie. At this point, we‚Äôd spent almost every waking moment together. I also slept over at her apartment again, but there was still no sex. I have to admit, I‚Äôve only had sex once before, and I get anxious when it comes to initiating. She seemed to really want it, but I kept holding back, partly because of my lack of experience and partly due to sexual anxiety.\\n\\nI think what makes things more complicated is that I‚Äôm into some kinky stuff‚ÄîCBT, facesitting, feet, domination‚Äîand I wasn‚Äôt sure how to bring that up. She strikes me as more submissive and gentle, and I didn‚Äôt know if she‚Äôd be open to it. I kept stalling, telling myself I‚Äôd make a move eventually. But when she kissed me the next morning and teased, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take all my clothes off right now, what do you wanna do?‚Äù I still couldn‚Äôt do it. I told her, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs eat first and go out‚Äîwe‚Äôll do it tonight.‚Äù She seemed a little disappointed but didn‚Äôt push me.\\n\\nWe spent the day at the Pike Outlets in Long Beach, enjoying ourselves again, but I knew I was running out of excuses.\\n\\nThe Night It Fell Apart\\nThat night, we went back to her apartment. Things escalated‚Äîwe kissed, made out, and started taking each other‚Äôs clothes off. We were in her room, the lights dimmed, and the moment felt right. But when it came time for things to get physical, I couldn‚Äôt stay hard. She tried giving me a handjob, but it didn‚Äôt help. I suggested she sit on my lap to get things going‚Äîsometimes that works for me‚Äîbut even then, I kept losing my erection.\\n\\nAt this point, I felt humiliated. I hated myself. I was trying so hard to make it work, suggesting different positions, but they were all pretty vanilla since I didn‚Äôt know how to introduce the kinks I‚Äôm into. Normal sex doesn‚Äôt turn me on the same way kink does, and I felt trapped. I wanted to ask her to be more dominant or to grab me in a certain way, but I was too scared to bring it up.\\n\\nAfter an hour of trying, I asked her to grab my balls while she gave me a handjob‚Äîit‚Äôs something that worked with an ex who was also into kink. But this time, it didn‚Äôt have the same effect. Eventually, she just collapsed face-down on the bed in silence. I felt awful.\\n\\nThen, out of nowhere, she started crying.\\n\\nThe Aftermath\\nAt first, I thought she was crying because I was terrible in bed. But she told me that wasn‚Äôt it‚Äîshe thought I wasn‚Äôt attracted to her. She kept saying she felt ugly, and it broke my heart. I tried to comfort her, telling her she was beautiful and that I was absolutely attracted to her. She really is stunning‚Äîshe‚Äôs a dancer with an amazing body and the sweetest personality‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt know how to explain that my struggles were more about me and my sexual preferences.\\n\\nI spent the next hour holding her, reassuring her, and telling her how gorgeous she is. But she kept crying, convinced that she wasn‚Äôt enough for me. It was devastating. Honestly, I would have preferred if she had been angry at me‚Äîit felt so much worse knowing she thought she wasn‚Äôt attractive.\\n\\nEventually, I left that night. I told her I had to go home for work, but she was worried I‚Äôd ghost her. I reassured her that wasn‚Äôt the case, but I felt like I‚Äôd already hurt her deeply.\\n\\nWhere We Are Now\\nShe‚Äôs still texting me and even calling me ‚Äúbabe‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs like she really wants me in her life. She told me I‚Äôm the best guy she‚Äôs ever been with (though obviously not sexually), and I feel the same way about her. I really care about her, and we have an amazing bond. But I‚Äôm still terrified about the sexual side of things.\\n\\nI want her to know what I‚Äôm into, but I‚Äôm scared she won‚Äôt understand or that it‚Äôll push her away. She seems more submissive, and I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôd be comfortable taking on a more dominant role. I think she‚Äôd be willing to try for me, but I don‚Äôt want to overwhelm her or make her uncomfortable.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\nI couldn‚Äôt get it up for my girlfriend because I‚Äôm into kink, and she seems more vanilla. She ended up thinking I wasn‚Äôt attracted to her and cried, even though I am attracted to her. She still wants to be with me, and we have a really close bond, but I‚Äôm scared to tell her about my kinks and not sure how to move forward.\\n\\nAny advice is welcome, and no I don‚Äôt watch porn ',\n",

By 4 my guts were starting to rumble. \\n\\nI managed to keep it contained until I got home and ran to the bathroom to pass this unholy log. Another 15 minute battle commenced where I strained so hard that I had to pray I wouldn\\'t pass away on the toilet like the king. (RIP Elvis.)\\n\\nI finally managed to get it out of me. Noting that a poop knife would have been appropriate,  I was lucky that it flushed without any further issues. \\n\\nIt took me another 5 minutes to get cleaned up when my wife had the audacity to ask (clearly knowing my schedule and that the afternoon wasn\\'t normal) me if I was \"alright.\" \\n\\nThe worst part is that I know the excess fiber capsules are still doing their thing, while I feel like I just pulled an all nighter as the damn bottom at a Diddy party. \\n\\nTL;DR: Ate too much cheese. Compensated with fiber capsules. The fight still isn\\'t over.\\n',\n",
       " 'TIFU The Day That My Mom and Brother ALMOST Drowned and I Didn‚Äôt Do Anythin - About three or four months ago, I did something truly terrible that changed how I see myself. It‚Äôs one of those moments that will stick with me forever‚Äîkind of funny and yet profoundly embarrassing.\\n\\nSo, there I was at a family party, which was a big deal because my family is enormous. I‚Äôm talking about all my dad‚Äôs sisters, their kids, and everyone was having a blast. The venue had a pool divided into sections for kids and adults, and things were going great until a weird incident changed everything.\\n\\nI was in a room with some cousins. We were singing, dancing, and just being silly, with music blasting. Then, as it often does at parties, there was that awkward silence between songs. Suddenly, we heard someone banging on the door. It was one of the adults, and she yelled, ‚ÄúWho can swim? Your brother is drowning!‚Äù\\n\\nEveryone in the room sprang into action, rushing out to help. But for some reason, I stayed behind, calmly talking to the woman and asking what was going on. She looked at me in disbelief, insisting I should help my brother. I kept insisting he was fine, just splashing around in the pool. Meanwhile, my mind was completely frozen.\\n\\nFinally, I decided to join everyone outside, only to find that my brother had been wearing a floating device that helped him swim, and he was heading toward the adult section where he really shouldn‚Äôt have been. He was the only one swimming there when suddenly, the floating device popped, and all the air inside it went out. My mom jumped in to help him, and she was grabbing onto the edge of the pool, then she walked toward my brother. When she realized that she couldn‚Äôt reach him because she was small and the pool was too deep, she went back to the edge of the pool and kept trying to get to him multiple times, despite how difficult it was. She later told my dad that in those moments, she felt like she wanted to die(That‚Äôs why she kept trying to save my brother, knowing that she couldn‚Äôt. She‚Äôd rather die trying to help her son than watch him drown in front of her). My grandma jumped in too, but when she noticed she couldn‚Äôt reach the bottom, she stopped. By the time I came back, everything was already happening. They were trying to get my brother out of the pool, and I felt so late to the whole situation\\n\\nAs I watched my family struggle, my thoughts turned dark and selfish. All I could think was how this would ruin the party. I remember thinking, ‚ÄúGreat, we‚Äôll leave early now. My mom‚Äôs going to hate pools.‚Äù I felt like a terrible person, especially knowing that my younger sister were being more helpful than I was.\\n\\nEventually, my brother was rescued by someone who actually knew how to swim. I stood awkwardly smiling while everyone else rushed to help. When it was over, I was left feeling ashamed. I had brought towels and napkins, but in my mind, I was still processing the absurdity of the situation.\\n\\nLater that day, we wrapped up the night with my brother going back to swim, and I joined him too. But it didn‚Äôt stop there. When everything happened, I went back to my cousins,‚Äîthe ones I was dancing with‚Äîwho were all yelling at me, cussing me out. ‚ÄúWhat the heck were you doing? Why were you so silent?‚Äù they asked. I tried to lighten the mood by saying, ‚ÄúOh my God, let me tell you what was going through my mind!‚Äù But they were so judgmental about what I did. I felt awful, but I just kept joking around to cope.\\n\\nAt one point, they yelled at me to bring water, so I did. But as I was going to get it, I couldn‚Äôt help but think, ‚ÄúWhy would I bring water if my grandma or my mom was, like, drowning with water?‚Äù I was trying to make light of the situation, but deep down, I felt like the worst person ever.\\n\\nThat car ride home was silent, filled with my thoughts about the whole ordeal. I couldn‚Äôt shake the embarrassment and regret. That moment haunts me, reminding me of how unprepared I was when my family needed me the most.\\n\\nTL;DR: Thought my brother was just goofing off in the pool at a family party until his floatie popped and he started drowning. Stood around uselessly while everyone else jumped in to save him(he ended up not dying). Still feel like the worst person ever for it',\n",
       " 'TIFU by entering the wrong hole - A couple of days ago, my girlfriend and I were hanging out at my place. We‚Äôre watching our favorite YouTube series when things got intimate. In the middle of our intimate moment, I had remembered the last time we did it I had tried out a new position that she enjoyed, and I had wanted to try it again. At first, everything was fine. We were both enjoying ourselves thoroughly until I had slipped out and in the hear the moment I had quickly try to put it back in, however, with the speed at which I was putting it back in the dim lights of the room in the slippery lube that was applied I had accidentally penetrated her backdoor . Right as I entered the tip, she started screaming and I had pulled out immediately. She started shaking and crying on the floor, telling me to stay away from her and stood there in shock and horror at what I had just done. After a few moments, she had calmed down enough for us to sit down and talk about it. It took roughly half an hour before she started feeling ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again although the pain was still there. She decided to take a nap for about an hour and as we were laying together, I could hear softly her saying ‚Äúno‚Äù and ‚Äúit hurts‚Äù. At the time I had thought I had misheard her or that I was simply hearing things as I had a history of hearing things when no one said anything or completely misinterpreting what someone said. I would be quickly proving wrong as after a couple days the pain back door had subsided however this night before heading to sleep, she had told me that she had nightmares about what had happened and this completely tore me up inside as the last thing I ever wanted was any mental distress to someone I genuinely love and care for. For the past seven days since the incident I have been trying to help in anyway I can finding out ways to alleviate her ‚Äúback door‚Äù pain in anyways or just being someone she can call and talk to however, with the knowledge that the experience has given her nightmares really shook me to my core as I no longer know what to do. Ideally I would want to still be the person she can come to too and help her through this, but given, I am the subject of her nightmares, I‚Äôm not too sure it‚Äôll be helpful if I‚Äôm the person to do it.\\n\\nTLDR: after accidental anal, I have become the subject of my girlfriend‚Äôs nightmares, and I don‚Äôt know what to do to help.',\n",

(I originally posted it as a comment on u/queerharveybabe ‚Äòs dance floor post.)\\n\\nWhen I was in 6th grade, my school had this thing called a Starlab. It was basically an inflatable mini planetarium. A whole class could fit inside and watch the outer space projections on the ceiling. Cool, right?\\n\\nExcept it was very dark, you had to crawl through a tunnel to get in and out, and I suddenly felt super claustrophobic.\\n\\nI tried to sneak out a nervous fart, but I ripped ass instead. It echoed. And it stank. Kids yelled, gagged, and fell over each other trying to get out of the Starlab. I had just turned it into a real gas giant.\\n\\nIn a likely violation of the Geneva Convention, the teacher ordered everyone to sit down and remain in my fart bubble until the space presentation was over. This teacher was retired military, and thus completely unfazed by my weapon of ass destruction.\\n\\nIt was dark enough in the Starlab that no one could confirm that I was the source. That was the only saving grace.\\n\\nI‚Äôm not sure how much anyone learned about space that day.

       " 'TIFU by getting an erection while helping my drunk GF throw up - Last weekend my GF (32F) and I (32M) went to a friend‚Äôs wedding. We\\'re not a \"drinking couple‚Äù. So far in our relationship I had never seen her drunk until last week. Only slightly tipsy after a few occasional champagne glasses. I myself don\\'t drink at all, but I\\'m ok with her having a drink here and there (we have openly talked about this).\\n\\nAt the wedding, on the way to the party, she said to me \"Hey! I feel like getting drunk tonight. I haven\\'t done it in a long time. Is that ok with you?\". I thought \"What the hell, if she wants it this one time... why not let her?\". \\n\\nFast forward to 2AM and my GF is plastered, stumbling and slurring her words. When I saw her falling asleep in her chair and almost slipping to the floor, I decided it was time to put her in bed. \\n\\nI took her back to our hotel room, undressed her, and laid her in bed; then, she said she was going to be sick. So I got her up again, walked her to the toilet, and fulfilled my gentleman‚Äôs duty holding her hair while she threw up.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s when the weird boner happened: I got rock-hard down there and kind of aroused while she gagged and spewed wedding cake. After she was done vomiting (it took her a while), I took her back to bed and I masturbated to get rid of my hard-on. \\n\\nI have a strong stomach. Seeing someone vomit doesn‚Äôt make me feel squeamish. That said, I also don\\'t have an inclination for that kind of stuff.

I know there is fetish porn about vomiting, but that\\'s never been my cup of tea.\\n\\nThis is the first time I‚Äôve seen her be sick. Overall, I had a pretty fun time seeing her get drunk and taking care of her, and she was naked while vomiting, if those are things that can explain what happened... Not going to say I\\'m traumatised by this. I just feel a bit awkward.\\n\\nTL;DR: I got rock hard seeing my drunk GF throw up. Weird.',\n",
       " 'TIFU By Using Children‚Äôs Advil As Lube  - As the title suggests, took the wife on a romantic weekend getaway in the mountains. We wanted to start the weekend with sex, so we got right into it shortly after checking into the resort. The luggage we used had previously been used on a family trip with the kids, and we had some poured some liquid children‚Äôs Advil into a small Tupperware shot glass container with a lid. We used the same type of container on this trip and filled it with coconut oil, which is our go to. They apparently have similar viscosities. In the heat of the moment I grabbed the wrong one and used it without hesitation. Everything seemed fine until I switched up the pace by going down on her. I noticed that she tasted‚Ä¶.. fruity. Like a strange chemical cherry flavour. I took me a couple minutes to realize what was going on and it was at the moment I knew I‚Äôd fucked up. I stopped, the wife asked what was up and I had to tell her that I‚Äôd just fucked her with Advil. Oddly, it was very difficult to find information on Google about the safety of Advil that‚Äôs been liberally applied to the inside of a vagina. However my wife is a trooper and after a few minutes when everything seemed to be fine, we grabbed the correct product and finished the deed. No harmful after effects. \\n\\nTL/DR - accidentally used Advil as lube and there were no harmful consequences. ',\n",
       " 'TIFU by yelling at a family friend over opinions during my brother\\'s birthday party - This post is intended to accompany my other post, as a potential explanation.\\n\\nA bit of backstory, my family has been neighbours with another family since I was 4. Let‚Äôs call them the Smith family. The Smiths have 2 kids, Michael (26m) and Nicky (21m). Nicky is a year older than me and hung out with my younger brother (16m) and me (20m) during our childhood.\\n\\nGrowing up, Nicky was always stronger than us. He probably wasn‚Äôt as bad as others, but he would often resort to violence whenever we didn‚Äôt please him. One memory I have was during a sleepover, where my allergies caused me to make sounds. He would get up, come to me, and punch me several times. It was done repeatedly for each noise I made, getting harder each time.\\xa0\\n\\nMichael was kinder to us, never assaulting us. The issue was‚Ä¶Michael would be violent towards Nicky instead. One memory I have is Michael kicking Nicky‚Äôs back. I recall seeing Nicky cry from the bullying. Another more important memory, is a time where the Smith brothers and I were Kayaking. Michael tossed Nicky into the water, told him there were rocks, and kayaked away with me in it. He called Nicky a pussy, and said even I was braver than him. There might‚Äôve been a chain of violence. I‚Äôm not innocent in terms of violence either. I made my younger brother cry and also got into a lot of fights at school, probably the most out of the 4 of us. Maybe it‚Äôs just boys being boys.\\n\\nThis summer, I flew back home from college. Nicky was still abroad but Michael was home. In August, I went to visit him, he currently has his own place. We sat down and caught up with life.\\n\\nI decided to tell him about the [house fire](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nijmegen/comments/18uu2z1/i_feel_so_lost_update_to_the_electrician_scammer/) I had back in December. How unfairly I felt like I was treated, being blamed by my landlord for the fire just because of how it [looked](https://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/191rakq/can_a_kitchen_hood_catch_on_fire_on_its_own/), yet he isn\\'t a professional and didn\\'t request an investigation during the night of the incident, when the firefighters were there. After hearing the story, he said something along the lines of ‚ÄúThe landlord could‚Äôve charged you more, so just be glad\". By now, I am 95% sure I didn‚Äôt cause the fire, and I told Michael that. I also told him how frustrated I was that my parents paid the landlord 400 euros, to show that it was in the past. In the same conversation, I asked Michael if he got into fights at school. He said he didn‚Äôt, because he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt like causing trouble‚Äù.\\n\\nAfter leaving the house, I kept thinking of the conversation we just had. The same person who abused his brother growing up, yet never fought anyone his own size, is telling me to let things go, to take the easy route, the pussy route. I often threw myself at bigger kids at school and even punched Nicky back a few times, so while I caused more trouble for my parents, I felt that I was more honourable.\\n\\nFast forward a few days, we were having a celebration for my younger brother‚Äôs birthday. It wasn‚Äôt his actual birthday, but we had an early celebration as his birthday fell on a school day (my university and my brother‚Äôs high school have different academic calendars, being in different countries and all). My brother was going to have another, bigger celebration after I left. Little bro was hanging out with his friends in a different room, while I was sitting at a table with my dad and Michael. Michael asked what I‚Äôd been up to.\\xa0\\n\\nMe: Oh, I‚Äôve been rehearsing\\n\\nMichael: Oh, for what?\\n\\nMe: Well, you see\\n\\nI brought up my observations about his behaviour growing up.\\n\\nSuddenly, my brother and his friends entered the room to ask my dad for something. I tried to quickly tell them to leave the room, looking back I could‚Äôve simply waited, but I panicked and just continued.\\n\\nMe: You‚Äôre a pussy Michael.\\n\\nI don‚Äôt quite remember the rest of the conversation, everyone was shocked. My mom entered the room, hearing the commotion. My dad recommends I leave to buy more pizzas with my mom, to which I comply, though not without saying ‚ÄúGo fuck yourself‚Äù while leaving the room, much to my dad‚Äôs annoyance.\\n\\nOn the way to the store, I explained what happened to Mom. My mom says that it‚Äôs just Michael‚Äôs opinion. I told her how I felt like I was being victim-blamed, and combined with the bullying growing up, made things really frustrating. I also described my theory of the violent chain, how Michael hitting Nicky caused Nicky to take the anger out on us, making Michael potentially guilty of my childhood bullying.\\n\\nNonetheless, I understood that it was all in the past and that my behaviour was irrational. Once we got home, I went to apologize to Michael and explained why I was mad. He accepted my apology. He then explained that he wasn\\'t blaming me or telling me to be grateful, more of looking at the positives, how my landlord could\\'ve made things more complicated by charging me the full amount, potentially leading to a lawsuit and hours of investigation. Later on, after leaving the country, I texted him, telling him that I was also a coward, making no effort to stand up to the [electrician ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nijmegen/comments/18a5525/was_i_scammed_am_i_entitled_to_a_refund/)because they might have social power over me.\\n\\nIn the end, I got mad at the wrong people, and let the incident cause me further trouble over 8 months later.\\n\\nTL;DR: Called a family friend a pussy in front of my brother during the latter‚Äôs birthday over an opinion on an incident that happened 8 months prior.',\n",

We were talking the other day. They sent me a screenshot of a conversation they were having with their other friend. They seemed more energetic then when talking to me. They usually only talk in 3-4 word sentences, or they will send me a wall of text. I love it either way. Back to the story. I kind of felt hurt in a way. I don\\'t know why. So I said something like \"Whoa you text differently their.\" I was met with a response of just \"Yea that just happens when I\\'m around my friends\". I was like damn. Im not a friend? I then said something about being jealous of those people then. I was then sent a sticker and we sent stickers till She stopped. So yea I\\'m kind of fucked man. I don\\'t know what to do. Anyone have any advice on what I should do? (Sorry if this was really bad its my first time posting here)\\n\\nTL;DR: I got a crush on my online friend. They are great. I was sent a screenshot of them talking to their other friends. I made a comment about how she seemed different and that I was a little jealous. Conversation then ended. I\\'m scared and don\\'t know what to do anymore.',\n",
       " \"TIFU, I didn't realize how sick my parent's dog really was - TIFU: Didn't realize how sick my parents dog really was\\n\\nTrigger warning: the dog dies\\n\\nSo, this happened last weekend. My parents always have me take care of their 2 horses and 2 dogs when they go on vacation or do a long day trips. I live ~17 minute car ride away (US). It is a burden, but they give me free childcare 3 days a week, so I just accept I'm their go to for all tasks. \\n\\nA bit of background, my mom was a vet tech before I was born (~34 years ago). We were always raised that pets are family and they deserve the best. This is something I adhere to today as well. My mom doesn't ask my older brother to do help because he follows his wife (no vet/vaccines, no check ups, no spay/neuter). \\n\\nMy parents brought their dogs to my house Saturday night since they were leaving Sunday morning. I have their 2 dogs (Old= old dog, 15ish + Young= younger dog, 4ish). My two don't really factor into this story. So, Old needs a lot of extra help, she lost a leg to bone cancer last year, she is deaf, needs help going up and down stairs. Young is healthy and has fun playing with my 2 ragamuffin pups.\\n\\nSunday morning is normal. All 4 dogs eat/play. Sunday afternoon around 2 pm, Young starts acting off. She seems stiff, is off-standish, not with the other dogs. Around 4pm, I start to get concerned and offer Young a dog treat. She doesn't eat it. I call my parents while they are driving to their cabin to tell them she's acting off and describe her symptoms. \\n\\nMy mom and I agree she has probably eaten one of my 3 year olds toys. I don't know which one. My mom said she's bad about that, I have no idea which toy she could've eaten, but I go about monitoring. \\n\\nShe gets more off-standish, but is still mobile, drinking water, and pees/poops outside. I continue to update my mom.\\n\\nNow, this is when it all goes to hell. My younger brother is special needs and is scared to stay the night alone. So I'm at my home with my son and 4 dogs. My husband goes to my parents house to look after my brother and take care of the horses (my brother doesn't want to stay at our house). \\n\\nI put my 3 year old down around 9pm, Young follows me into his room, so she was mobile at 9pm. Young and I hang on the couch until I'm ready for bed around 10:15pm. Young can no longer stand without assistance. \\n\\nI call my husband and tell him to get home asap. I call my mom and tell her Young is not doing well. She is understandably upset. I am doing online check in at Emergency vet clinic (closest one is 23 min away) while my husband is coming home to stay with toddler. \\n\\nMy mom is convinced Young ate a toddler toy  This is incredibly likely. But I always put up toys because one of my dogs will destroy toddler toys too. So it is standard protocol to put away toddler toys every evening and before we leave the house. My mom thinks it happened Saturday night because Young shouldn't have reached that point so quickly.\\n\\nBefore my husband gets here, Young throws up, starts choking. \\n\\nI'm on speaker with my parents. I'm following their instructions, doing chest compressions, rescue breaths, checking her mouth. She stopped breathing twice. I was able to get her breathing again once. \\n\\nShitty story summed up, Young didn't make it. Lots of tears. My parents leave the cabin immediately to come back. I wrap up Young in a towel and blanket and placed her on the guest bed. \\n\\nIt's been a bit over a week now. My mom 100% blames me. She is still giving us childcare for now, but isn't acknowledging me. We used to be so close. I don't know what to do. I can't fix this. In hindsight, I obviously would've taken her to the vet sooner. I figured I'd just take her to the vet first thing Monday morning if she was still off.\\n\\nYoung had cancer previously. My grandfather is terrible for dropping his heart/BP pills. I know it was likely me, but maybe it wasn't. Regardless, the dog died on my watch.\\n\\nI don't know how to open this conversation or how to apologize. I'm just stuck in this crappy loop where I made a poor decision to save a few bucks to avoid the emergency vet. \\n\\nI'm so frustrated. I moved to this stupid city to be closer to my parents for childcare. I hate the house and town. But it is too expensive to move and now if my parents decide to cut me off because I didn't take their dog to the vet sooner, I don't know how to afford childcare. And I am so screwed.\\n\\nTL;DR: My parents dog was acting sick (likely ate a toddler toy and was impacted) and died. Now my mom hates me. \",\n",
       " 'TIFU by painting a wall - My wife and I have been happily married for just over a year, but we‚Äôve been together for more than 10. Today, though, was strange.\\n\\nShe quit her teaching job at the end of the school year and found a new job that started in October. So, we decided to use the gap to fix up the house we bought last year: Painting, improving electrics, redecorating, that kind of stuff. I even took time off so we could work on it together. We made good progress but didn‚Äôt finish everything.\\n\\nNow, with her new job, she‚Äôs working long hours and is exhausted, so finishing up on painting the last bits hasn‚Äôt happened even though I asked her if we could finish it many times. Tools and paint clutter the house.\\n\\nToday, I finally got fed up with tripping over all the painting gear. I knew she prefers us painting together, but I wanted it done, and wanted to surprise her with the finished task. I set everything up carefully and painted the wall and the wooden rim. It looked good, no mess. I was proud of myself. But then my wife came home‚Ä¶\\n\\nShe saw the painting tape, looked at the wall, and became furious. She barely spoke to me, even though I made dinner. Finally, after asking repeatedly, she said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no use; you‚Äôll just do it again anyway.‚Äù She criticized everything: I should have told her beforehand (it‚Äôs not like I do much without her knowing), used different paint, noticed a tiny paint drop.\\n\\nThen we went to her parents‚Äô anniversary. She didn‚Äôt wear her wedding ring (she never takes it off), barely spoke to me on the way, ignored me there, and was all smiles with everyone else. We walked home in silence, and she went to bed without saying goodnight.\\n\\nSo now I‚Äôm sitting here, wondering what on earth I missed and if my marriage is over. \\n\\nTL;DR: I painted a wall to finally finish the living room, but my wife disapproved and is acting like I betrayed her.

As a result I spend time kindling my own flame. It's not the most fun ever but it beats the alternative of a permanently unlit wick. Who wants that?\\n\\nMondays are one of my work from home days. I'm an early riser and having some time awake by myself I thought that I might make some kindling (yes, I'm really straining the analogy here) When I'm having fun by myself I often enjoy anal stimulation - the issue is that it can be a process. So this morning, I did a virtual coin flip - two heads, plug away, two tails do without. It came up tails. \\n\\nNow why flip a coin if you're not going to follow the result? Well that's the beginning of the fuckup. I ignored the coin flip, got prepared, inserted a silicon plug and by the time I was good to go, the spouse was starting to stir. Oh well, right? I waited until she was in a different part of the house and retired to the bathroom to clean up and from there I would stash everything away and no one more the wiser. Except, after I'd done some posterior housekeeping I flushed the toilet and then dropped the plug in. Would it flush down? No. Could I plunge it back? No. I had first plugged myself and then done a second, better plugging on the toilet.\\n\\nSo not only was my alone time fun time thwarted, I also had to call a the plumber then take that nice young plumber into my confidence about why he was there. A nice, expensive plugged toilet, sigh.\\n\\ntldr: flipped a coin, ignored the results and instead of plugging myself, I plugged the john.\",\n",
       " 'TIFU and almost ended up on the First 48!  - ******This is my first post, so I apologize for the formatting. I have redone it and split it into paragraphs. I hope this helps.\\n\\n\\nSo this actually happened in May. I had recently left a long term relationship and decided it was time to get back out there. I (31F) downloaded Hinge and matched with a guy (33M) that was very good looking and we hit it off. After a few weeks, I agreed to go on a date with him. We agreed to meet up for a casual coffee date and a walk in the park. \\nSo it is time for the date and I show up on time but he is 15 minutes late, I let it go. Of course it‚Äôs awkward meeting someone and I had been out of the game for seven years so I wasn‚Äôt really sure what I was expecting. \\n\\nAnyways, he gets out of the car, comes up to me and opens his arm for a hug, and I reciprocate. He then immediately goes in for a kiss with an EXCESSIVE amount of tongue. It caught me off guard, but he was really good looking so I let it go. I figured I was just lame and this is what the cool kids do these days. ü§∑üèΩ\\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è \\nSo, we get inside this little mom and Pop shop, place our order and it is time to pay, but he just walks away with the drinks. I said out loud ‚ÄúI guess I will pay for them‚Äù, he responded with ‚Äúoh if you don‚Äôt mind‚Äù. I would like to note, I have absolutely no problem paying it just again threw me off because it was never discussed just assumed. Again,I let it go. \\n\\nWe sit down and start having pretty decent conversation, but he is making very intense eye contact and making audible grunts, which made me a little uncomfortable but not enough to throw any major flags. \\n\\nSo it is wrapping up and it is time to go to the park. Like a dumbass, I agree to get into the car with a stranger an allow him to drive us there instead of following behind. So we are driving along and he is going the wrong direction to the park. I asked where we were going and he tells me he wanted to take me a mountain lookout. But the specific location he mentioned is known as a place nothing good happens. I veto that. He then tells me he wants me to meet his mother. I say no to that as well. This man pulls up to his mom‚Äôs house. I told him in not comfortable with this. He tries to reassure me by mentioning that it‚Äôs really his house, his mom just lives with him. üôÑ \\n\\nAt this point, the red flags finally start to make an appearance. I told him that we had agreed to a walk in the park. He reluctantly agreed and headed to the park. He was also swerving all over the road andI swear he fell asleep at least once if not twice. I wanted to just dip out, but I didn‚Äôt have my car so I had to ride it out. I convinced him to let me swing by to get my car so it wouldn‚Äôt be a hassle later. I should have bailed right then. But nooooo, me being a dumbass, I still follow him to the park. \\n\\nSo we start walking and this man pulls his shirt off and leaves it off for the remainder of the date. Keep in mind, it‚Äôs a public park with a bunch of kids and old people. He wants us to sit on a bench to talk. We sit down. \\nY‚Äôall, this man starts to pray, LOUD af. \\nAbout how grateful he was that I was put into his life and how much he LOVES me and he is in love with me and that I‚Äôm his girlfriend. People are walking past us just making eye contact with me as I mouth the words, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù. It was so awkward. \\n\\nI should probably mention this guy is like 6‚Äô4‚Äù at like 250+lbs. very athletic obviously works out. big enough that I knew I couldn‚Äôt take him if I ran. At this point, I was just trying to hurry it along so I could go home. \\n\\nWe start walking again and he tries to lead me to the edges of the park. The crowd is no longer granny‚Äôs and little kids. I‚Äôm stepping over needles and around homeless people. There are a bunch of abandoned buildings nearby. He said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been in these buildings at night, wanna check em out with me?‚Äù I said,  ‚ÄúNO, I think my mom is calling I need to go home. Thankfully he didn‚Äôt push it too far. \\nSo he walks me back to my car and as I try to slide in, as I‚Äôm swinging my feet under the dash he grabs my left foot (wearing flip flops) and proceeds to put his MOUTH on my toes. \\nYall, the gasp I gasped! \\nHe notices, let‚Äôs go and says, ‚Äúhang on‚Äù. He is parallel parked in front of me so I can‚Äôt just leave. He digs in his truck for a while and comes back with a jacket. He throws it through my driver window all the way to the back of my SUV. Looks me dead in the eyes, serious af, and says, ‚Äújust so you know, I‚Äôm very possessive of my belongings, and you are not girlfriend now‚Äù. I just looked back and said ok cool. I took tf off. I looked like Lightning McQueen pulling out. \\n\\nSomething didn‚Äôt feel right, so I pull over a few blocks over and grab the jacket. I look in the pocket and there is an Apple Air Tag inside. I threw it in the dumpster at in the parking lot and took the longest way home I could. \\n\\nDates over, I‚Äôm alive! I call my bff and tell her wtf just happened. She was like, ‚ÄúBITCH, did you forget how to google‚Äù. I get home, put my FBI cap on and start looking. Tell me why THREE mugshots pop up, drugs, assault, and domestic violence. I also find him in one of those, ‚Äúare we dating the same guy‚Äù groups. Yall, his exwife and other past partners had all the receipts. This man is crazy af. He is also in school to be an anesthesiologist! The last person I would want around while I‚Äôm unconscious! \\n\\nI forgot to mention the funniest part!

       " 'TIFU by my wife finding about my sex toy order - I 29M am married to a 33F. My wife is not as interested in sex in general, while I clearly want more. We have sex about once in 1.5 months so I do feel some sexual frustration. She works from home so it‚Äôs not like I can just masturbate either.\\n\\nRecently, she had gone back home to see her family for a few days. I have always been curious on getting one of those 5 lb+ ass with vagina silicon toys as they seemed quite intriguing.\\n\\nSo, I ordered one of Amazon which said it had discrete packing to use it while she‚Äôs away. I used it 3-4 times and then decided it‚Äôs too much work to maintain one / also felt some guilt around it so I threw it in the trash before she returned home.\\n\\nNow this was more than a month ago. The package as promised was indeed in discrete packing and it was discarded successfully.\\n\\nHowever, today I received a letter in the mail from the Amazon seller soliciting a $25 gift card if I were to leave a review for this 5 lb ass and vagina combo I had ordered (with a photo of it). I know that‚Äôs against Amazon seller policies and I could report to seller but the damage is done. My wife checks the mail and she found the letter.\\n\\nShe shouted calling for me, and confronted me on wtf did I order showing me the paper. I quickly accepted what I had done, and told the full truth along with the fact that I had discarded it.\\n\\nShe was hurt by it and very angry at me. She asked me to leave the home but I didn‚Äôt want to as I said I‚Äôm already leaving for a work trip the day after.  I live in a 2 story 4 bedroom home. She packed a bag of my toiletries, towel and sheets and put them outside the room on the floor and commanded me to stay in another room downstairs. I apologized multiple times but she said she doesn‚Äôt want to be near me and that she‚Äôs disgusted by me.\\n\\nIn my view I bought myself a sex toy to use at my own private alone time. I‚Äôd never think of cheating on her or anything of that sort despite my sexual frustration.\\n\\nAnyways, now I‚Äôm in another room of the home with an angry wife and no idea on how long (if) it might take for her to come around.\\n\\nTL;DR: Bought a 5lb ass and vagina combo and threw it. Amazon seller sent a letter in mail asking for 5star review a month later that wife found.\\n\\n‚Äî‚Äî-\\n\\n** Update 1 (10/28) **: Wow, thanks for everyone‚Äôs input I didn‚Äôt expect this post to get so many replies but appreciate everyone! So, the times she came out of the room today, she did not look or even speak with me, she was very clear saying ‚Äúget away from me‚Äù whenever I tried to speak or apologize. \\n\\nBased on the responses here, I did text her because I couldn‚Äôt speak to her. The summary of the text is, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre exaggerating this. You were in Vegas, and I bought myself a toy in my private time alone at home, which I even threw away. I‚Äôve never had any sex toys, so I was curious to try one. Why would I tell you something so private about getting myself a toy while you weren‚Äôt here? I‚Äôm sorry if I upset you, but I shouldn‚Äôt be able to masturbate, especially when I‚Äôm home alone?‚Äù This text was 3 hours ago, still no reply. It seems it‚Äôs going to be another night of me and my dog sleeping in another bedroom.\\n\\n** Update 2 (10/30) **: I returned back from my work trip and she was sitting in the living room watching TV. She didn‚Äôt look away the entire time and her back was facing me for the most part.\\n\\nShe brought some more stuff of mine from the master bathroom to the other that I‚Äôve been using and organized it in the bathroom.\\n\\nMy dog was excited I was back so I put a collar on her and took her for a walk. When I returned, wife had left the living room. She spoke from a distance only 1 line for the night ‚Äúthere‚Äôs packages for you out front‚Äù. And then later she closed the master bedroom door. I checked the packages later, and one was some sweets she had ordered for me before this whole incident. \\n\\nI sent her a text to simply thank for the sweets that she didn‚Äôt reply to. She leaves to visit her family in Vegas again this weekend for ~2 weeks. Hoping we can at least talk like adults over the whole incident prior.',\n",
       " 'TIFU by losing my bag with weed in it - Sorry for bad grammar, english isn\\'t my first language\\n\\nSo it all started yesterday (sunday) when I (18F) and my friend group planned to sleepover at my friends\\' (18M) house to hang out, maybe drink and smoke some weed, so I went out to buy a tobacco pipe for it.\\n\\nAlso, it\\'s important that here cannabis/marijuana is taken nearly as seriously as hard drugs in the sense that you could get 2-10 years in prison depending on circumstances for *drug users* and then with suppliers it\\'s 5-20 years *or even life sentence if it\\'s in larger quantities*\\nSo I just want to say that at least here it\\'s a really big risk with a small reward to it, and that I do not recommend drug use in general.\\n\\nSo after I got the pipe I joined the others at my friends\\' place which is at the edge of town, and just kinda difficult to get to with the annoying bus schedules, and also it being at the weekend.\\n\\nLater when we were getting out of it we went into the city to grab some snacks from the store and maybe grab some kfc while we\\'re at it, and then go back to his place.\\n\\nNow this is where my f*ck-up happened.\\n\\nI managed to leave my bag at the god damned bus station in front of the ticket office around the evening, but we only noticed it at night 3 hours later after last bus that goes back and forth already left, and that meant a 1 hour and 30 min walk just to the bus station from there, with his parents already sleeping with absolutely no way of sneaking out to make matters worse. So in the end, we decided to call the bus company\\'s customer service line in the morning, since if somebody wanted to take the bag, they would\\'ve done so already by the time we got back. This morning we checked the ticket and lost and found office in person, since no one picked up the customer service line (because of course), but nevertheless the bag wasn\\'t found.\\n\\nAnd now the dread just sets in, since I realized that in that bag were most of my clothes, my papers in preparation to graduate, a personal unreplacable gift and basically everything that wasn\\'t my wallet or bus ticket for this month and personal cards (and obviously lost the not so cheap bag itself too which I used for school every day for just a year at this point) which suck of course, but the weed was also there, and a random envelope of gift cards with my father\\'s name and phone number that I forgot about sometime ago.\\n\\nSo now I\\'m scared shitless that my father will get in trouble because of my f*ck-up, and my only hope is that whoever the h*ll either doesn\\'t go through the trouble of reporting it, but I doubt it  since I don\\'t know how \"well officer, here\\'s some weed and an envelope with a name in some random school bag I found\" would work... \\n\\n\\nTL;DR\\nWent to my friends\\' place to smoke weed, but on the way back lost the bag with all my stuff in it including the weed, and a gift card envelope with my father\\'s name and number. And I\\'m scared because using weed is really punishing here if it\\'s reported and traced back ',\n",

Today, each of us needed things from the store and as I was the one of two of us who had a relatively decent car, it was decided that I was the one to drive us there.    \\nGetting to the store went smoothly and so did the ride back, everything good so far, despite me being an inexperienced driver and getting a bit nervous and overly analytical of my driving.    \\nThen came the part of arriving at the school parking lot.

They did not agree.    \\nI hadn't even begun to slow down, let alone put the gear in reverse, before they began commenting on and critiquing my positioning. This led to me suddenly being fully aware of my actions and stop driving autonomously, which of course led to me stalling.

       " \"TIFU by thinking I was alone in the house - This actually happened about a year ago when I was 16. It was a school day but I was at home for some reason, I cant actually remember why, and the rest of my family had gone to work/school so I had the house to myself, but my dad did tell me at about midday a couple of plumbers were coming over to try and fix our water pressure and that they knew what to do so I could just ignore them which was fine by me. Come midday im lying on the couch scrolling on my phone when the plumbers arrive. And theyre actually mostly tinkering with the hot water box thingy outside, only occasionally coming in to test a tap or something, so its like they arent even there.\\n\\nNow me, being a hormonal teen, all of a sudden get the urge to, yk, choke the chicken. And I enjoy doing it in big open spaces like my lounge room, it feels kinda freeing in a weird way. Plus I could hear the plumbers outside and the only way they would be able to see me is by looking through the front window, which they have no reason to do because they're out the back, or if they looked through the big glass back doors, which have very loud wooden steps leading up to them, giving me ample warning if one of them decided to come inside. So instead of retreating into the safety of my room I pick my poison and whip my shit out right then and there. Im about a minute deep when I hear footsteps, not from the wooden steps or the front window, but from inside the house. Ive never whipped my head up faster. I feel my heart sink to my stomach as I make direct eye contact with the plumber exiting my laundry room. I somehow didnt hear him at all for the  5 odd minutes he'd been in there and thought he was out tinkering with the box like the other guy. So I lock eyes with this poor plumber for like a full second, meat in hand, video blasting, and then all at once I turn off my phone and try subtly hiding my meat behind the pillows and he just turns and walks out the backdoor, which is right next to the laundry so he was gone quick. \\n\\nI obviously stopped after that but I was to ashamed to even get up and go to my room so I sat in the exact same position until they left about 20 minutes later. After they left I went and stood where he had been standing to try and gauge how much he saw, and luckily because he was looking at me from over the back of the couch, I think the pillows mostly covered up my weiner, but he definitely heard the video, and he definitely saw the position my arm was in. I still lie awake at night and ponder why I did that dumb shit\\n\\nTL;DR I masturbated in front of the plumber by accident because I thought he was outside\",\n",

After waking up I had morning nausea which is typical for me if I don't emmidietly get up after waking up. I dragged myself over to the kitchen and grabbed a slice of bread. In my groggy not wanting to be awake state I thought there would be no issue with crapping while eating because I wasn't patient enough to do one at a time. I then rolled around in bed for awhile and was feeling nauseous I thought it might be a hangover so I went over to grab baking soda and drink soda water. right after taking my first sip I realized these weren't the burps of relief... I emmidietly grabbed a bowl and threw up nearly more than 12 hours after drinking which confused me so much. So I did a quick a Google and realized this wasn't my proudest crap (even tho it was pretty massive and impressive) since eating while crapping increases the amount of fecal matter consumed that is flying in the air. If anyone has any idea if that is actually why I threw up or any tips I would greatly appreciate it. (Ps. I have never gotten sick due to drinking even tho I blacked out many times)\\n\\nTldr.

       " 'TIFU by Letting My Sister Hang Out With Friends - I (18F) just wanted to say that I don\\'t regret most of my actions, but it was definitely a fuck up. My sister(16F) got grounded by our mom (50F) because of her grades. Personally, I think it\\'s bullshit because my sister has mostly As and Bs (she used to have worst grades last year, BUT SHE\\'S LEARNED HER LESSON AFTER GETTING GROUNDED FOR GETTING A D/C). But since my mom expects \"perfection\" VIA all As, my sister got grounded. I don\\'t think it\\'s fair at all - official semester report cards haven\\'t even come out and she\\'s basing my sister\\'s achievements based off of constantly updating grades. I know some of her teachers like to give everyone in their classes 0s on certain assignments to encourage/remind students to do their schoolwork as well (BECAUSE I TOOK THEIR CLASSES!!). It sucks ass, and I think my mom was being to harsh on that.\\n\\nBack to the story! So, my sister, and her friend (16F), asked me to take them to the library. Since I didn\\'t have anything better to do, I decided to agree to drive them to the library. I got my laptop and then we drove to the library. It was pretty productive. I saw them take notes (well, mostly. I could tell they were messing around a few times) and I was in the corner writing for a personal project. Another friend dropped by, and then they all wanted to go to another friend\\'s place. I mean, I just shrugged and rolled with it. We\\'ve been to this friend\\'s place before, so what\\'s the worst that could happen, right?\\n\\nLong story short, we lost track of time. Our mom noticed and knew that the library was probably closed (closed at 5, we were still out by 6:30) By the time we got home, she was pretty pissed. We both got grounded for the rest of the month and I\\'m now not allowed to drive anywhere besides school and/or to drop off my sister.\\n\\nDo I regret it? Not really - I think my mom\\'s reasoning for grounding my sister was unfair. (...Might be because of my own anger at being treated poorly because of the high standards of consistently getting As. I know how much grades are starting to affect my sister because of our mom and typical school pressures. She has a good social life and I don\\'t want her to end up like me.) The most I\\'m sad about is that since I\\'m grounded, I can\\'t go out and do club activities and go to social events. Sucks since I\\'m in college and a commuter, which means I can\\'t really connect with my college as much as I used to, plus all extracurricular activities are at night.\\n\\nBut sucks to be me, I guess. Even though I don\\'t regret it, I wish I was at least a little more conscious about it.\\n\\n(Btw there\\'s only one thing I agree with my mom about this whole situation - It was pretty late. My sister does have school tomorrow - I do too, but I have afternoon classes. But other than that, the reason for grounding is something I didn\\'t agree with AND I was there to supervise. Ugh, maybe it\\'s just that late teenage rebellion my mom thinks I have :/)\\n\\nTLDR: I drove my sister to her friend\\'s place, we lost track of time. Mom got mad and grounded us both.

       " 'TIFU by telling my friend congrats on her daughter\\'s marriage  - Obligatory \"Didn\\'t happen today.\"\\n\\nWhen I was 19 and attending my hometown\\'s junior (2-year) college, I became good friends with two non-traditional students, Ann and Hillary, in a class we shared. They were in their early-mid 30s. We stayed friends after our shared class ended, occasionally catching up at the same restaurant where we\\'d eat after class.\\n\\nAnn was a bit eccentric but a sweetheart. She\\'d invite me on trips with her daughters, who were roughly ages 11 and 13. Wanting me to \"see more of the country,\" she invited me to her sister\\'s out-of-state wedding, when her husband couldn\\'t go and wouldn\\'t take their girls out of school in January (important later).\\n\\nI moved on to attend university, but a couple years after college graduation, I moved back to my hometown to work at the newspaper. Hillary had moved, but Ann and I caught up at our old regular restaurant. I took some senior portraits for her oldest daughter who was now graduating high school, and after that, we kinda drifted.\\n\\nWorking at the local newspaper means seeing **all** the courthouse records published in the paper. And when Ann\\'s youngest daughter was **just 18** , I saw her in the list of new marriage licenses! Ann\\'s daughter Lucy had pretty standard first and middle names. But back when the girls were little on one of those daytrips, they talked about how, after giving birth, Ann was so out of it, her husband misspelled Lucy\\'s middle name accidentally or otherwise on the birth certificate. \\n\\nSo seeing Lucy\\'s name in the recent marriage licenses was solid, could-not-be-mistaken for someone else with that name proof ... And to be honest, Ann was known to fib to make some stories sound cooler, so it was also kinda proof that Lucy\\'s name story was not one of those fibs.\\n\\nWell what do you do when an old friend whose kids you knew as littles has a kid GETTING MARRIED? You message her, \"Looks like congrats are in order, Mother of the bride!\" With a bunch of smiley faces.\\n\\nA confused? Ann responded that both her girls were single! She said she\\'d pass along my congrats to her brother, who was married that week. Back when I was Ann\\'s plus-one at her sister\\'s wedding, I\\'d met her parents and all her siblings, so she thought (or hoped) I just meant him.\\n\\nMeanwhile MY brain immediately started saying, \"fuck, fuck, fuck fuck fuuuuuuck.\" It\\'s so crystal clear with 20/20 hindsight that this was a land mine ... Lucy was **barely 18.** At the time, yeah girl was young, but I had classmates who got married at 18. It never occured to me LUCY GOT MARRIED BEHIND HER PARENTS\\' BACKS. IN SECRET. And it apparently didn\\'t occur to Romeo and Juliet that modern marriages are published in the local paper. \\n\\nI couldn\\'t lie and say I had the wrong Lucy, again with the middle name thing. So I just told Ann how odd it was a Lucy Middlename Lastname, of the same age, was in this week\\'s marriage licenses. Ann responded, \"wishful thinking on the boy\\'s part. Lucy told him no.\"\\n\\nI let Ann have it and just said, \"Ahh.\" Knowing, There. Is. No. Way. a boy, man, woman or anyone can file for and receive a whole ass marriage license with the other party in absentia. That\\'s not how it works. But poor Ann now had bigger worries and I wasn\\'t about to call her out even more. \\n\\nLater Lucy herself messaged the newspaper social media accounts asking if we could unpublish the marriage license, as there\\'d been a mistake and it was no longer relevant. She didn\\'t try and say she\\'d *rejected* it altogether like her mom did. Nor did she argue the accuracy or anything ... So I knew Ann trying to save face was just that, and Lucy did, in fact, sign a marriage license at some point. The newspaper did not, ever, remove public records, including this time. \\n\\nI never heard what happened to Lucy and Romeo, whether they\\'d already broken up by the time the record was published or made to by their parents, or something else? I sure as shit wasn\\'t going to ask. I do know they did not stay married.\\n\\nAnn sent me some copy/paste \"pass this on\" thing at some point, and I gave her a salon suggestion in response to a post, but we never had a full conversation again. Some time later I noticed a blue, \"Add Friend\" button by her name. It would have been cool to keep in touch on social media but knowing we\\'d all but drifted, and coupled with that mortifying (for us both) exchange, the friendship was probably meant to fade. \\n\\nTL;DR: I knew the young daughters of an old college friend who was a little older than me. Years later I moved back to town and when I saw the youngest daughter\\'s name in the newspaper\\'s marriage licenses, I congratulated my friend on being a \"mother of the bride,\" only to find she had no idea her 18-year-old daughter applied for a marriage license ... and her daughter didn\\'t realize public records were published in the newspape',\n",

We have so much in common: we like the same music, have read the same books, and share similar tastes in shows and movies. We even agree on most opinions about them. We clicked very quickly and started chatting on Instagram about a week after meeting. A month later, we exchanged numbers.\\n\\nI started feeling more infatuated with Josh when he began giving me little gifts, like chocolate bars and truffles. Once, when we were discussing our favorite superheroes, he mentioned his was Superman, and I said I loved Spiderman. For his birthday in May, I gifted him a Superman keychain‚Äîa small gesture, just so he wouldn‚Äôt feel unnoticed. Then, on my birthday in June, he surprised me with Spiderman socks (which were adorable). By then, I was completely smitten.\\n\\nJosh is charming, with curly, long hair, a cute goatee, and a fit physique from working out.

He‚Äôs often disrespectful, frequently making inappropriate comments about women‚Äôs bodies and how he gets \"horny\" for them.

My neighbor showed it to me on her phone. I didn\\'t tell her not to post it anywhere, but my face also doesn\\'t hide what I\\'m feeling so I\\'m pretty sure she could see that i wasn\\'t comfortable with the whole thing.

If she does end up posting it, I\\'ll add the link to this post, but as for right now I\\'m keeping my physical self off of Reddit as I do enjoy the fact that nobody here knows what I look like.\\n\\nJust another edit bc someone dmed me that this is \"definitely going to end up in a Smosh video\": Hello, Shayne/Dad!

She shook her controller up and down like a lightning blur, and ended up winning easily.\\n\\nI was a little... precarious at the time. Especially after not seeing her for so long at that point. After she won from shaking her controller so hard, I saw this as prowess from a side of her that I\\'ve never seen. The thought rushed to my head, and I acted on impulse.

I don\\'t think she really got the idea at this point.\\n\\nI decided to just take the assumption that she didn\\'t get the idea and just say it bluntly. I mentioned to her how impressed I was that she shook her controller to turn the crank as quickly as she did. I then asked her if she could do the same thing to, well, my crank.\\n\\nAfter this, she stared at me awkwardly, I could tell she ended up being very offended by that, as if I bluntly insulted her or something. A few seconds into that moment is when I realized \"Oh, shoot--\". She got up from her seat, and looked at me distressed. All she said at that moment was \"What is wrong with you?\" and left to go back home, without talking to me. I was too anxious at that time to say anything in response.\\n\\nI messaged her later that night, hoping to resolve this incident, but she never did end up reading any of my messages. I hope I can end up apologizing for what I said.\\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: Got horny from a motion controls mario party game that my gf won and scared her off.',\n",

I reached out and he ended up apologising about what happened, said he should have said something when I puked but he had a bit of a knee-jerk reaction. He was a bit afraid to reach out because he thought he pushed me into doing something I was uncomfortable with and that‚Äòs why I ran off. I explained I was mostly embarrassed although what he did was a bit too aggressive for my first time. He was sorry for that too, said he had a bit too much to drink as well and wasn‚Äôt being considerate. He offered to make it up to me by taking me out to dinner and having a proper date.\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nI met a guy last night at the grocery store while I was buying a bottle of wine for a party. My costume had no pockets so I forgot to bring ID with me. The cashier was being difficult and wouldn‚Äôt let me buy it so I just left.\\n\\nThe guy behind me in line bought the wine and chased after me to handed it off to me. He complimented my choice and chatted with me while I headed over to my friend‚Äòs place. He was hitting on me pretty hard - asking me if I had a boyfriend, etc., I was using my boy voice the whole time but since I was fully made up and dressed like Velma from Scooby-Doo, I told him I was trans to be sure but he could already tell. I found him very fun and charming, so I let him have my number when we parted ways and he asked for it.\\n\\nI meet up with my friends, and we have a few drinks before heading to the party. I had been really excited about this because it was a genderbent party. I‚Äôm in the closet and boymode most of the time to avoid my parents finding out via social media, so having a chance to be fem presenting without anyone finding out was pretty awesome for me.\\n\\nThe party was a big university event and we had to queue to get inside. Unfortunately we arrived too late and couldn‚Äôt get in. We queued for a bit on the off chance there was extra capacity, but eventually gave up and headed to another club. There were three of us, and one friend ended up running off with a girl he met. When my other friend left for the washroom a guy started grinding up on me while I was dancing. I was a bit tipsy and my favourite song was on so I leaned into it. Unfortunately he got a bit handsy and clocked that I had boy parts. He backed off immediately and shouted ‚ÄúWTF‚Äù - and I just ran out of the club without looking back.\\n\\nThis was quickly turning into the worst night of my life. The guy from the grocery store had been texting me, and we had a bit of a back and forth all night, especially when I was queuing. He bragged a lot about his wine collection and invited me over. At this point I was ready to head home, but I lived on the other side of town and really needed to pee. I didn‚Äôt really want to head into a public men‚Äôs bathroom dressed as sexy Velma, so I figured I would stop for one drink, use his toilet, and head home.\\n\\nI stopped by his place, fully transparent I am only doing this for a bio break. We had one drink, but we started talking about ourselves and I felt myself really opening up to him. So I stayed for another. He was really sweet, understanding, and mature. I also clued in that I had met him before because I came to his cafe several months ago. He was flirty back then too.\\n\\nI told him some really personal stuff and cried a little bit. He hugged me and we cuddled on the couch for a bit before he finally kissed me. Things got pretty heated, and I got a bit testy when he touched my boy parts - I explained to him it was connected to a traumatic experience I told him about and it really triggers me. He backed off, but I could still see that he had a raging hard on.\\n\\nI really liked him and I didn‚Äôt want to leave him unsatisfied or make it seem like I didn‚Äôt want him so I got down on my knees to give him head. It was actually the first time I ever did something like this so I was terrible. My teeth kept getting in the way and I could hear him get frustrated.\\n\\nI told him I was sorry and this was my first time but I really wanted him to feel good, so he sighed and told me to stick out my tongue. He then grabbed me by the head and started throat fucking me. I was gagging a lot but I could tell he enjoyed it so I let him keep going.\\n\\nBut when he came it was too much, there was a huge wave of nausea and I projectile vomited all over his lap. We‚Äôd been eating snacks the whole time so it was a lot, it got all over his junk, his clothes, and sofa. He ran off to the bathroom to wash himself off immediately, and I felt so embarrassed I just left home while he was in there without saying a word.\\n\\nI really liked him, but I feel like I ruined everything. I don‚Äôt know what I should even do at this point. Should I text him sorry for leaving him with a giant pile of puke? Should I just forget this whole sorry episode and move on? It was cathartic to write this out at least. I feel a bit less humiliated, thanks for listening.\\n\\nTLDR; I gave head for the first time to a guy I really like and ended up throwing up all over him then running away.',\n",

       " 'TIFU by trying to make a Halloween costume and ruining the countertop in my dorm - This is mostly me trying to ask for advice on what I should do than telling a story, but I don\\'t know where else to ask this so if someone can at least direct me to a better sub to ask about this that would be great.\\n\\nSo I, 18f, live in a college dorm like most college students. It\\'s really fancy and has a kitchenette area with cheap laminate countertops. Last night, I was trying to super glue the headpiece I had for the costume to something that would make it stick better on my head. I left it on the countertop and ended up getting some super glue on the countertop. I thought, \"oh no that\\'s not good\" and looked up how to get super glue off of countertops after scrubbing it with soap and water did nothing. One website said to scrape at it with a non-serated knife under a layer of paper towels so as to not ruin the countertop. I don\\'t have any real knives in my dorm so I used a pair of scissors instead which definitely was a horrible idea because I couldn\\'t get them exactly flat against the countertop, and the very tip of the scissors would have more pressure than the rest of them. I began scraping and heard some scraping noises and thought that that was the super glue coming off. I was so wrong. While I did get some of the super glue off, I wasn\\'t able to get a sizable amount removed and worse I had scratched the hell out of these countertops. I started panicking and then tried looking up how to get scratches out of countertops. I saw somewhere that baking soda paste can be used to help scratches on countertops, and that was also one of the solutions to the super glue problem. Perfect, I\\'ll just go to the store and buy baking soda and kill two birds with one stone. Except when I used the baking soda, nothing happened. Or at least any changes were so minimal that I couldn\\'t tell a difference. Currently the countertop still has a bunch of little white scratches in one compact area that the other 3 girls I live with all said they couldn\\'t notice. I pointed out the spot to my suitemate and she said \"well that\\'s definitely not ideal\" so it\\'s definitely not unnoticeable once it\\'s been brought to attention. I tried to look at more options, but whenever I see someone ask a similar question of how to get scratches out of laminate countertops the responses are basically \"you\\'re fucked lol.\" \\nI don\\'t know how to fix this on a budget, I don\\'t even think I can anymore. I don\\'t know if I should try to get someone to come and fix it or just take the L and whatever fine they give me at the end of the year for ruining the counter. How much money can I be fined for this? Are they gonna try to charge me for a whole new counter top? Any advice of what to do or who to talk to would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\nTldr: I got super glue and scratches on the countertop in my dorm and don\\'t know what to do.',\n",

What bothers me even more is that some of these geeky nerdy guys also had other relationships/girlffiends before and it makes me feel even fucking worse \\n\\nI tried improving myself a lot. I lost weight, am in much better shape, I got a higher paying job at JFK airport, I got new hobbies, and it truly means nothing.

       " 'TIFU by posting a naughty pic to my Snapchat story by accident.  - I wanted to surprise my man while he was at work today so I did a lil photoshoot of ‚Äúthe girls‚Äù. For once I was satisfied with the first photo, so it was going pretty well by this point. I‚Äôll admit though I like to play around with filters that change the grain/saturation/contrast/etc not the ones that completely change the way I look but the ones that make it look artsy ya know? \\n\\nSo I was searching the filters trying to find the right one that showcased these little ladies without being too much. I finally found a combo I was satisfied with and I sent the snap to my man. Well I have a toddler who needed me for something so I locked my phone and went to deal with her. \\n\\nA while later I unlocked my phone and it opened back up to Snapchat back where it would have been after I took the photo but hadn‚Äôt sent it yet. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to do this because I already sent it and so my thumb was already going towards the screen to do whatever I was going to do on what I was expecting to be my home screen. I ended up pressing the add to story button before I even realized I was still in Snapchat. Not just my story but my public story at that. I tried to delete it as quickly as possible and it wasn‚Äôt up long but anyone who gets notifications for my stories would‚Äôve got a notification for it and would have been able to see it if they opened the notification. I know this because my baby daddy called to tell me I had posted it just as I deleted it. \\n\\nIt could‚Äôve been worse and at least it was a good picture but still I‚Äôm so embarrassed. I feel like such an idiot. And I don‚Äôt even wanna know how many people saw it. I wanna crawl in a hole and die of embarrassment. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm embarrassed of people seeing my tits it‚Äôs more so the fact I don‚Äôt know who saw it and literally anyone could have since it was a public story! I can‚Äôt believe I did that, I feel like such an idiot. I honestly want to delete everyone off my Snapchat now but it wouldn‚Äôt even fix anything because it happened and whoever saw it, saw it I can‚Äôt undo that. \\n\\nTLDR; I accidentally posted a tit pic to my public Snapchat story. I deleted it almost immediately but I know at least two people saw it before I deleted it because they have notifications for my stories turned on. Idk how many more people actually saw it in the ~30 seconds it was up before I could delete it. I could die of embarrassment. ',\n",

I thought it was a funny story which people would enjoy. But those that did enjoy it like I intended are being downvoted into oblivion. So yikes. Moving the TLDR to the top, because I stated everything in that for this story to be avoided for those who so badly did not want to read.

I thought this could‚Äôve been a nice breather from the unending negative ones. \\n\\n‚Ä¶..\\n\\nTLDR; don‚Äôt skinny dip kids. Husband &amp; I locked ourselves out of a cabin &amp; I was stark naked. Thankfully we managed to find one unlocked door.\\n\\n\\nMaybe NSFW? Involves nudity but nothing really explicit is described.\\n\\nAnyway‚Ä¶ Basically‚Ä¶ the title‚Ä¶ but let me explain. \\n\\nSo my husband (34M) and myself (27F) got married earlier this year and went on our honeymoon shortly after. We have quite a few financially taxing plans coming up in the next few months so we decided to take a short honeymoon to a cabin on a lake.\\n\\nIt was absolutely beautiful and we would love to have another stay here again. Our favorite parts about this trip are the fact that it was on a lake, had a barbeque and firepit as well as a hot tub on an outside deck with an overview of the lake. Little did I know this trip would‚Äôve been memorable for a completely other reason‚Ä¶\\n\\nSo, it‚Äôs our honeymoon. There‚Äôs a hottub. Yes, I wanted to relax without the restrictions of a bathing suit and it was very freeing and exhilarating. I loved it.\\n\\nOn our last day I went ahead and popped in the tub. My husband was grabbing some spare towels and followed me out afterwards shutting the door behind him. The house was old so it shifted a little weird after it was closed so my husband just tugged gently and tried to make sure it was fully closed. All of a sudden‚Ä¶ this is what he says:\\n\\nHubs: ‚ÄúBabe??? Did you lock the door?‚Äù\\nMe: ‚ÄúNo?‚Äù\\n\\nHusband continued jiggling the doorknob and looked at me like a deer in headlights. The door appeared to be locked. \\n\\nAt first, I thought he was joking. Now my husband is rather silly, he is the funniest person I know in my life and he is the kind that likes to prank me, of course it‚Äôs all in good fun. But this made me skeptical of being gullible. I thought this was one of those moments.\\n\\nI told him that‚Äôs hilarious and to open the door and come get naked in the tub with me (he had his swim trunks on where I left my swimwear inside). He didn‚Äôt let up. He told me he wasn‚Äôt joking and that the door was really locked and he had no clue how. For a solid 2 minutes I didn‚Äôt believe him until he was maniacally pulling and pushing and twisting on the door knob in exaggerated motions demanding he was not joking.\\n\\nMy stomach sank and I felt my eyes get the same deer in headlights look. Here we were, in an AirBNB cabin in the middle of nowhere, with our cellphones locked inside and me wearing my birthday suit. I felt like a little child where my parents just spanked me and started inwardly panicking. I kept picturing scenarios in my head where the only option we had would be to pad barefooted wearing nothing but a damn towel to the next door neighbors cabin half a mile down and hope that someone was there to be able to call for help. \\n\\nI jumped out of the tub and wrapped myself in a towel when I remembered: we left the cabin earlier to grab some food and came back and my husband forgot his phone in the car. His ankle was injured at the time and the walk to the car while not too far was still enough that I offered to get it for him so he wouldn‚Äôt be hobbling on his hurt foot much longer. I have a habit of locking doors once we get inside (how we managed to get into this predicament)‚Ä¶ but I didn‚Äôt remember locking the front door after grabbing his phone because I went to hand it to him immediately. \\n\\nI prayed that door was open, prayed that I hadn‚Äôt locked the front door and wouldn‚Äôt have to be naked except a towel in the middle of nowhere to walk to a strangers house. Of course, I still had to check to make sure he wasn‚Äôt messing with me and turns out the door really was locked. (Yes, I still doubted him, he is a big trickster sometimes.) He stared at me with a bewildered look on his face before shouting sarcastically ‚ÄúYES. IT‚ÄôS REALLY LOCKED!‚Äù (In a humorous way, he never really gets mad, the only feelings we felt at that moment was a mix of hilarious hysteria and panic in this situation)\\n\\nI went around the deck to the front door (it wrapped around the house) and held my breath as I turned the knob. The door‚Ä¶ opened. \\n\\nI could breathe again. I waddled my naked butt inside and shut the front door, locking it behind me, and walked to the back door leading to the hottub to unlock it. My husband was watching me and simultaneously having a panic attack as he watched me lock the door behind me and was probably also praying I wouldn‚Äôt be dumb enough to lock us out again.\\n\\nLucky for him he married a woman that had some brains. They just come late to the party sometimes.\\n\\nAll self-deprecating jokes aside, we felt dead relieved that I didn‚Äôt have to show up to a strangers house naked. And we died laughing about this after the terror was over. üòÇ \\n\\nFast forward to our checkout: we were wrapping up everything reading over the AirBNB‚Äôs requests for setting everything up for the cleaning crew and upon rereading the binder, we discovered that they had a spare key hidden under a fake rock by the garage‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Would‚Äôve been nice to know while I was panicking outside in the nude‚Ä¶. ',\n",

Recently, I discovered this very specific ‚Äúhack‚Äù to get snacks without triggering her supersonic snack radar. Somehow, whenever I tried to sneak a snack from the pantry, she\\'d hear the slightest crinkle of the bag from another room. Like, I could sneeze right next to her, and she wouldn‚Äôt bat an eye, but crinkle a chip bag and she‚Äôs there in seconds, giving me *the look.* That‚Äôs when ‚Äúcrinkle karma‚Äù was born.\\n\\nI decided to *invent* something I called ‚Äúcrinkle karma.‚Äù I told her that every time you crinkle a snack bag and *don‚Äôt share*, crinkle karma will come for you. Basically, crinkle karma would curse you to spill something, get a stain, or just embarrass yourself snack-wise. She gave me a look like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre full of it,‚Äù but seemed slightly intrigued. So, crinkle karma became our household joke, and I started tossing it around whenever she gave me that look.\\n\\nFast forward to a few nights later. I‚Äôm in the kitchen, barely moving, trying to *avoid the wrath of crinkle karma* by opening a bag of chips *as silently as possible*. My wife walks in and gives me this sneaky smile before whispering, ‚ÄúShhh, crinkle karma.‚Äù She actually believed it enough to come get a handful of my chips, guilt-free. At that point, I‚Äôm convinced that maybe crinkle karma has some real power over her‚Äî*and maybe me too.*\\n\\nCut to another day or so later. I‚Äôm sitting at my computer with a secret stash of Oeros, operating in complete stealth mode to avoid crnkle karma\\'s curse. I‚Äôm taking each cookie out slowly, trying to be crinkle-silent. Then, out of nowhere, I hear this random crinkle noise from somewhere in the house. *Cue immediate panic.* I swear my heart skipped a beat, convinced that my nonsense about crinkle karma had somehow come to life and was haunting me.\\n\\nMy wife finds me mid-panic, holding an Oreo with this wide-eyed look. She puts her hands on her hips and says, ‚ÄúThe ol\\' Stinky Crinky finally got you, huh?‚Äù She has never been more delighted to see me fall victim to my own made-up superstition. And now, she‚Äôs constantly warning me about ‚Äúcrinkle karma‚Äù every time I even think about sneaking a snack without sharing.\\n\\nLesson learned: don‚Äôt invent random snack superstitions like crinkle karma unless you‚Äôre fully prepared for your wife to turn them against you. Because now, crinkle karma is haunting me on the daily.\\n\\n  \\n**TL;DR:** Tried to mess with my wife by making up ‚Äúcrinkle karma‚Äù as a fake snack-stealing superstition.

       " \"TIFU by trying to find food I could taste after losing my sense of smell to COVID - I'm a fairly decent cook. I worked in the restaurant industry for 20 years in every role from dishwasher to line cook to restaurant manager, in anywhere from dives to award winning restaurants. And my reward for this earlier this week was a visit from Aunt Rona that progressed into losing my sense of smell in the middle of cooking dinner. I can't smell a thing, believe me, I've tried. This also means I can't taste a thing.\\n\\nI decided to test this more thoroughly throughout the day. I can't smell my cologne directly out of the bottle, so I tried experimenting with different foods. I now know that I can *detect* foods rather than taste them. I know when something is salty, I can tell if it is bitter, I am aware of umami, I can still get a dull response from sour, and spicy works just fine. I have no idea if something is sweet. But these are senses, not true flavors.\\n\\nI started this morning with some leftover salmon patties that had been fried in lard, with a side of Dijon mustard. Nothing. Less than the night before, as a matter of fact. It may has well have been prison loaf. Later I had a small, cold, cheddar cheese sandwich on white bread. I knew what I was eating and could feel the sharpness of the cheese, but still no flavor. So I decided to ramp it up a notch.\\n\\nTotino's pizza rolls with Yellow Bird habanero sauce and limeade. It had less flavor than cardboard despite that being a probable ingredient in 2024. It felt a little like being a three year old at the poker table eating the chips. Mere rectangles of foodlike substance in a spicy nothing with tart, cold neutrality. This is what I would liken to the peak of a bad shroom trip; it seemed to be the height of danger from which I would step down.\\n\\nLater, I wanted a snack and didn't want to chance spending half of tomorrow on the toilet at work after telling my boss to fuck off while drunk as hell and then calling in with COVID at 2:00 AM and taking the next four days off, so I decided the lava pouches would be a bad idea.\\n\\nI microwaved a couple of papadums and filled a little bowl with aloo Bukhari, a type of sticky, sour, orange plum grown in Afghanistan. It was equal parts resigning myself to textural eating to at least appreciate mouthfeel, and continuing the experiment with food just littering my pantry. The plums are really sour and usually smell a little like feet. Well, I couldn't smell them, and they were still sour.\\n\\nI did not consider that papadums are often made with some sort of basic preservative like baking soda or slaked lime when I did this. Nor did I consider the impact lentil flour and dried plums would have on my digestive system. I had just eaten four ibuprofen, as well. The bilge pump was a-churning long before I realized it.\\n\\nLet's go over the foods one more time:\\n\\n* Mushy fish patties fried in pork fat\\n\\n* Cheese sandwich for a lactose intolerant man\\n\\n* Doubleplus unfood with 2500 Scoville Units\\n\\n* Enteric coated Fever-B-Gon with science fair volcano fuel\\n\\nI am not a smart man.\\n\\nFirst there was a rumble, killers in the jungle. I know that sound, well. Then I got a bit of a seasick feeling that was like half illness, half drugs. And then I threw the blanket across the room and desperately grabbed at my Nintendo Switch, running 10 feet to the toilet, where I spent the next hour and a half cleansing my filthy temple of a body of every burnt sacrifice it had ever been offered. The entire week of Sukkot rioted against this unholy porcelain in protest to pork. A simple British butty came out of my batty sideways. Every jalape√±o within a 20 mile radius instinctively recoiled in horror at the expressions uttered as a legion of habaneros marched to war on the backs of not-pizza, not-solid.

Maybe its just the nature of the job or how interning is supposed to go in this industry but I have been shouted at infront of other vendors, power tripped on multiple occasions (they threw out my punch in card before I cam in to work), and overall they don\\'t respect me or my time. They know I am a student and keep me after hours when I need to be studying for exams, the worst part is that during the actual work hours they will have me sit there and do legit nothing. I ask if I can help and they tell me theres nothing to do right then, but when it comes time for me to clock out, they give me tasks that could last 2-3 hours long. I don\\'t really know the point of this but that\\'s the backstory to my work environment. They obviously don\\'t like me that much but I may have set them off the most this past weekend.\\n\\nSo, after work, I was looking through my phone via google photos. I had just gotten a new phone so google photos was setting itself up and trying to find my main account. However, for some reason It chose my work account to set up with instead. For context, my work account is shared between everyone in the office so everyone has access to it. But the absolute nightmare starts when I see a notification saying \"backup from device in progress\". It started to upload all the pictures and videos from my phone onto the public work account. All my photos from 2016-2023 were now on the work account for anyone, including my easily angered boss, to see. Like any normal adult I started to freak out. Scrolling through the feed, I saw pictures of them, work pictures, then a selfie of me, or a picture I used as a drawing refrence. Thank god I had no suggestive photos on my phone but I did have those of me in my natural hair. For context, I am black, in fact, the only black person that works here including all of the outside contractors that they hire to work occasionally. And I am extremely sensitive over my hair. I wear a wig and don\\'t really want other people to see my natural hair as it is kind of a vulnerable place for me to be in. So needless to say I was an absolute wreck. Luckily, I found a way to filter all the photos that came from my device and deleted them. Good news, they all came off the work account! Bad news, I have no more photos on my phone since It wiped them from the DCIM file too. I am really sad about the loss of all my photos but I guess that\\'s the price I have to pay. \\n\\nWhen I went into work the next day though, everyone was upset when I told them that I turned off backup on the google account. (I did not tell them why I just said I was having issues with my phone so I turned it off) They told me that I disrupted procedures and I was being careless. However, this whole thing happened when I was off at like 2am in the morning. They managed to change the backup settings on their computers within the hour they walked in so I don\\'t necessarily see why they are so upset. I also think my boss is particularly perturbed because I may have seen photos of him with other people than his girlfriend (there was some girl in a bikini on his boat that definitely didn\\'t look like her). So now my boss won\\'t even look me in the eye when he is talking/scolding me and keeps giving me tasks that keep me away from him. I don\\'t think my environment is hostile but I also can\\'t handle all this collective negativity from my co-workers. I don\\'t think I did anything particularly wrong in this instance, but that is technically 4 (grown ass) people all saying that I am the worst against my word. Normally that would mean that I\\'m in the wrong but I can\\'t tell for sure. \\n\\nTL;DR: I basically logged into my work account on my new phone and it took all the pictures off my phone and put it on that account for everyone in the office to see. I had to delete my photos off my phone to fix it and turn off backup on the account. Now everyone is mad because I turned off backup even though they have already turned it back on. I really hope none of them have seen my photos and I feel absolutely humiliated.',\n",
       " 'TIFU by following a staff to their storage room‚Ä¶ - I (18F) was in the middle of work at my student job working at the gym at my college, and I started to realize that I was on my period. I go on break to start going to my college‚Äôs womens program offices to grab a pad because my advisor told me thats where they defenitely had some. I go over and its in a little space in the wall inside the main student programs building and a women is standing in a very tiny lobby with a hallway to its side. I approach her and ask if they had pads so she says asks what size I need. I tell her, she says ‚ÄúOkay!‚Äù and I follow her to get the pads. I guess my fogged up brain that was on autopilot just interpreted that as following her to get some as I wasn‚Äôt implicitly told to wait. I pass some offices to my right with people talking in them maybe 3 it‚Äôs a very small space and a kitchen to my left (At the time I thought this was just a really comfortable space for women to get that kind of stuff IG?? and enter these offices as they are open wide). It takes 7 seconds that whole walk until shes at the storage closet she grabs them and realizes I was there, and immediantly gives it to me and gets angry. She yells ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to be here! This is a staff only space!‚Äù I immediantly start panicking and apologizing profusely as she continues to scold me saying stuff like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre invading their privacy and thats why theres a lobby here! You can‚Äôt just walk in there.‚Äù I grab the pads and just leave at that point, but I genuinely thought because the space was so tiny that it was supposed to be free roam like that but I was so embarassed after if I invaded anyones privacy or conversations in the rooms. I did feel unsure at the time if I was doing so even though I checked if there were any doors that said otherwise and they didn‚Äôt, but maybe thats because as a fellow student employee I was used to just going to the back areas but that isnt an excuse. üòû\\n\\n(Sorry for bad English)\\n\\nTL;DR \\nWent to get a pad at my college‚Äôs womens program center, followed the staff to get some because brain was on autopilot and got scolded for invading the staff space and the space where people were having confidential conversations‚Ä¶',\n",
       " \"TIFU by Keeping all of my Clothes in the same Moving Box. - Burner account as I feel my main profile is too associated with my hobbies/professional work.\\n\\nI (22 Male) recently just got my first house. A small home, a bit off the beaten path, 1 bed, 1 bath; definitely needs a little work, but I have big plans for it. I‚Äôm in the process of moving all of my stuff out of my parents house and into my new abode. So far I'm about 80% done. It‚Äôs been hectic for me, but fun as I'm experiencing the world for myself.\\n\\nWhen I bought my home, it came equipped with most appliances. MOST. It lacked a washer and dryer. With this next sentence you‚Äôll probably immediately pick up on where I'm going. I have a 3 year old gray tabby cat that I named Tom-Tom. He currently has some sort of stomach bug or something as he‚Äôs been having a hard time holding his bladder. And as the lazy sack of potatoes I am, I left all of my clothes in one box.\\n\\nOn October 24th, around 11 at night, when IT happened, I decided to hop into the shower. Being that I live alone I chucked the clothes I had on into the same moving box with the rest of my clothes. I spent about 20 minutes in the shower, got myself cleaned up and dried off. I walked back to the box when a putrid smell slammed into my face. My cat leaked all over my clothes. So much so that there were wet marks on all sides of the box. The only thing my cat didn‚Äôt urinate on was my shoes, thank god for at least that.\\n\\nI stood there trying to figure what I could do. I went ahead and put the damp box full of clothes out on my driveway so the stink wouldn‚Äôt fill my house. The night was BRISK. I think it was about 39 degrees F. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I thought about washing my clothes in the sink, but then realized I don‚Äôt have any decent way to dry them, not to mention how long it would take to wash and dry all of them. I then remembered that I live a 10 minute walk from a laundromat (I do have a car, but I let my Mother borrow it as I didn‚Äôt have anywhere I needed to be the next day.)\\n\\nI was stumped on how I would get down to the laundromat. I could have just used blankets to cover myself, but that would mean I'd have to hold a laundry bag and at least two blankets around myself simultaneously. I then remembered that I have a tri wetsuit. (I use it when I go swimming at a local lake.) The choice was obvious.\\n\\nI brought out my Roka wetsuit and got in it. I packed all of my damp clothes into a kitchen trash bag and nervously started my walk down the road to the laundromat. A big part of me was like ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm gonna end up on one of those YouTube dashcam compilations‚Äù. For anyone who has never worn a wetsuit, especially a tri wetsuit like my Roka Maverick Comp 2, these things are tighter than the average wetsuit and are meant to feel like a second skin, almost like you‚Äôre not wearing anything. So that made me feel extremely awkward as I walked down the road. Thankfully though, this road runs through a forest and is not favored by motorists, especially at 12 at night.\\n\\nAbout 10 minutes into the journey a police car pulled over next to me. I got extremely nervous. I‚Äôm a man ‚Äúdressed‚Äù in black walking down a deserted street at 12 AM carrying a black trash bag over my shoulder. He asked me if I was alright and I said yes. He inquired about the bag and told him it‚Äôs my laundry. He thankfully didn‚Äôt give a second thought (probably since the laundromat was in eye distance).\\n\\nHe then jokingly asked if I was going swimming while my laundry was washing. I chuckled and explained what happened. He also had a laugh and offered to drive me the rest of the way. I accepted and he dropped me off at the laundromat. After almost two hours my laundry was done and I started walking back to my house. It was thankfully uneventful despite the eeriness of that road. I got home and finally changed out of my wetsuit and into some normal clothes and let Tom-Tom lie beside me in bed.\\n\\nEdit: To help paint a picture, this is my wetsuit: [Roka Maverick Wetsuit](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91555Oc9QnL._SL1500_.jpg)\\n\\n**TL;DR**\\n\\nMoved into my new home that doesn‚Äôt have a washer or dryer. All of my clothes in one box. Sick cat pees in the same box while I'm in the shower, all clothes are damp. Only solution was to put on my tri wetsuit and walk down to the laundromat.\",\n",

I don\\'t know if it was because it hit my balls or if it\\'s because I had never used this specific oil, or because it was unexpected or what, but my balls and thighs burned **bad.** I was halfway walking to the door like a chick in a porno, legs squeezed together, trying not to fall down. I eventually make it back to my bedroom after much conflict, and I fly into my bed. I hit that thing with a Frog Splash to make Jey Uso jealous, and I immediately spread my legs and started hitting the panic button. It\\'s still burning.

To make things easier on me, my girlfriend (24F) decided we should just get takeout and chill. I agreed. We stopped at home and then she took our puppy and I stayed home to feed our other dog. I also decided to smoke a little weed while she was gone. On her way home, she called and asked if I would come down and help her bring the food and puppy in. I leashed up our other dog to take her out to save a trip. We headed downstairs, but my downstairs neighbor got home at the same time and started walking up to her apartment.

       " \"TIFU slept with my best friend - My best friend (35M) and I (35F) have been best friends since we were 19. We connected straight away but both of us were always in relationships and we never considered dating each other - we were good as friends. About 5 years ago when I was going through an irreversible rough patch with my fiance whom I was planning to leave, my best friend was always there for me and we both caved and gave into temptation while he was also in a relationship. I had told one close friend of mine. My fiance and I at the time had planned a destination wedding which I had called off, however, everyone had already booked flights and accommodation, so we all went (except my ex) and had a big party instead. My best friend and I had continued sleeping together this whole time and he remained in his relationship due to the holiday being planned with his (now ex) girlfriend and not wanting to turn that upside down at the worst possible time. While we were at this big party, we screwed with his girlfriend in the same building, and my friend who knew what was going on drunkenly told my ex's friend, and everything snowballed from there in the weeks following the trip. We definitely had feelings for each other but it all became extremely messy with the drama that came with people finding out and I decided to end everything which also meant ending our friendship. After 5 years, I decided to reach out to see how he is going and we immediately clicked and it's like we went back in time 6 years and we talk all day long the same way we used to when we were totally platonic. His friends keep saying it's a bad idea and he should stay away from me, my friends think we are meant to be. \\n\\nTL;DR We both just really want to be friends as we are happier with each other in our lives and try to block out what everyone else says. He has a new girlfriend now as well which makes things awkward given the history but we've both agreed that his new girlfriend can't find out about our history as she will likely become insecure and not want him to speak to me anymore.\",\n",

       " 'TIFU pretending to be someone I\\'m not - A few days ago my roommate informed me that her parents were on their way to our apartment to check up on her since she had not been feeling well. Me on the other hand, I was feeling fucking great, until my roommate mentioned that her parents believed I was gay. Now you might be wondering why. Well, so did I. My roommate said her parents would never have approved of their daughter moving in with a male roommate, so instead of standing her ground and telling her mom and dad that she was old enough to live with whoever she wanted, she was like, nah... the gay roommate story sounded better. \\n\\nI had very little time to absorb all of this information because the parents were coming and my roommate wanted to know from me if I was willing to play the part of the gay roommate. I said I was more willing to leave the apartment before her parents showed up and avoid pretending to be gay. My roommate said her parents were under the impression that I was taking care of her while she was sick, so it would make more sense if I was at the apartment. I was on the verge of saying no, until she played her \"you owe me\" card out of desperation and then attempted to downplay the position she was putting me in by saying it\\'s not like I had to \"act gay\" or anything. \\n\\nCut to me in pretend gay mode when my roommate\\'s parents arrived. To my roommate\\'s surprise, her parents were not alone. Her brother decided to visit too. My roommate was over the moon when she saw him. It was obvious that the two of them had not seen each other in ages. While brother and sister were milking every wholesome minute of their sibling reunion, mom and dad gravitated towards me. Cue awkward small talk. The dad asked me what my pronouns were and the mom wanted to know if I had a bf. My answer to the dad was he/him and my answer to the mom was no. The mom said she refused to believe that an attractive young man like me was single. She made sure she said it loud enough so that everyone could hear. \\n\\nMy roommate\\'s brother rolled his eyes as he looked at me and said his relationship with his ex bf came to an end literally like a week ago, but despite his recent break up, his mother was unashamedly playing matchmaker with the first available gay guy she came across. I looked at my roommate and low key attempted to communicate my discomfort with my eyes. I was trying to show her what was going through my mind at that moment, which was \"would\\'ve been fucking nice if I knew your brother was gay before I agreed to stop being straight.\" My roommate coughed all of a sudden and continued coughing until someone finally asked if she was dying. It was not the most subtle way of changing the subject, but at least she got the job done. \\n\\nI eventually excused myself and allowed my roommate to be alone with her family. I was in my room for like 20 minutes before I got an unexpected message from my roommate. The message was a warning or whatever that her brother was on his way to my room for some reason. Seconds later someone was knocking on my door. I took a deep breath and opened the door. It was indeed my roommate\\'s brother. He said he wanted to thank me for taking care of his sister because he knew from personal experience what a pain in the ass she could be when she\\'s sick. I said it was no problem. Then came an uncomfortable silence before my roommate\\'s brother said he had a question for me. I automatically sighed on the inside. The brother wanted to know if I was gay or bi because he checked out my IG and saw photos of me with my roommate, aka his sister, and apparently our body language in these photos made him feel like we might be more than just roommates. \\n\\nThe voice in my head said drop the act and just come clean, but the weed in my system said commit to the role and stay in character. I stupidly opted for the latter and said the following: \"bro... I am so fucking gay... I would empty my balls inside you and your dad before I even considered having sex with your sister.\" As soon as I said that, I stopped hearing sounds coming from the living room, which was where my roommate and her parents were. Everyone went from talking to not talking by the end of my sentence. It occurred to me that I might have said what I said with too much passion and forgot that my apartment was small. My roommate\\'s brother laughed and said he\\'s gonna have to visit his sister more often from now on. I said I had to go to the bathroom, which was just an excuse to escape. I locked the bathroom door and messaged my roommate to ask her if her parents heard what I said to her brother. \\n\\nMy roommate\\'s response was to send me like a thousand emojis that seemed to suggest that she was cringing. I returned to my room and never came out until my roommate eventually confirmed that her family was gone. She said her brother wanted to say goodbye to me, but she convinced him to follow her mom and dad\\'s lead and stay the fuck away from me. She sarcastically thanked me for being way too gay and scaring her parents away. \\n\\nTl:Dr My roommate convinced me to pretend to be gay in order to disarm her parents who were visiting our apartment and didn\\'t approve of her living with a guy who might attempt to hook up with her or whatever. I ended up getting way too committed to my character and making a fool of myself in front of my roommate\\'s family by saying I would fuck my roommate\\'s brother and her father before I would ever dream of touching her. Now my roommate\\'s parents probably feels even more worried about the wellbeing of their daughter thanks to me.',\n",
       " 'TIFU by ordering a sex toy off of Temu - Not too long ago, I turned 18. To celebrate, I decided to buy a bunch of stuff. I bought things like Black Ops 6, Starfield, a PS3, and Skylanders because I felt a bit of nostalgia. However, among the many things I bought, I also decided to purchase a sex toy off Temu for about $15. After buying it, I immediately regretted the decision and tried to cancel the purchase as quickly as possible.\\n\\n I didn‚Äôt regret it because it was \"wrong\" no, I‚Äôm way past that but I regretted it because I still live with my mother, and she is the most Christian person you could imagine. Even though she tolerates games, she would beat my ass verbally if I didn‚Äôt pray to God every hour, say my blessings, or even utter something that sounds like cursing.\\n\\nSo, I canceled the order and got my money back. All seemed well... until yesterday when my mother brought in a package. I asked her what it was, and she had no idea. I also had no clue because I hadn‚Äôt ordered anything else. I opened the package, and there it was, clear as day, the damn sex toy I had canceled and been refunded for. I didn‚Äôt tell my mother because, again, she‚Äôd beat my ass.\\n\\nAt first, I thought about throwing it away, but it was free, and I‚Äôve never had sex in my life, so I figured there was no harm in giving myself a little \"Arby‚Äôs beef and cheddar special.\" But man, was I wrong. The toy was absolute trash, the most disappointing thing ever. My cock and balls have never been softer and I genuinely think porn is ruined for me. So, I threw it away.\\n\\nBut here‚Äôs where I really fucked up. I didn‚Äôt put it back in the packaging or try to hide it. I just threw the shit in the trash like an idiot. My mom eventually found it because I didn‚Äôt bother covering my tracks. Now, not only am I going to church this Sunday, but I‚Äôm also getting kicked out of the house! I really fucked up this time.\\n\\nTL;DR: bought a sex toy off Temu, immediately regretted it and canceled the order. Got refunded, but the package still arrived. Tried it, hated it, threw it away without hiding it. Mom found it, now I\\'m going to church and most likely getting kicked out of the house.\\n',\n",
       " 'TIFU by not inviting Moe to a virtual job interview - In rare TIFU form, this happened about an hour ago and I am mortified.\\n\\nI had a virtual interview this morning for a contract gig with a pharmaceutical firm, and as with all the video interviews I do, I set up on the attic of my house on the third floor to avoid distractions from background noises  from my family. The attic room is finished as an office, so it looks professional, and my cats rarely go up there so it\\'s a good place for a private call or a video meeting. I have a node for my Wi-Fi extender in that room so the connection is stable and fast.  There is not a door to the attic stairs though, we took it off to allow better air circulation and to allow more space in the hallway on the second floor. (The doorway for the attic is right up against the stairs, leaving the door open creates a navigation hazard for my handicapped brother.)\\n\\nLike I said, the cats \\\\*rarely\\\\* go up to the attic. Except today. Just as the interview started one of the cats, Moe, decided to \"hide\" behind my laptop and play with the cord to my camera. I scooped him up and put him on the floor, thinking that the \"glitch\" for this meeting was past, because there is always a glitch at some point. \\n\\nThe interview was going great, we\\'re having a good conversation about the role and the skills I bring to it when the cats come into the attic. At first they are just playing in the background, so no big deal. I was about to blur the background when they chased each other down the stairs and out of sight. Here is where the FU happened.\\n\\nAs we were about half way through a 45 minute meeting, Moe jumped back up on the desk and started walking across my keyboard. No big deal, but I did not want him to flash his butthole to the camera so I scooped him up again. Except this time Moe did not want to be scooped up and started to protest by getting squirmy. I let him squirm as I lifted him up and moved him back to the floor and he struck out with his back leg, kicking me in the face. With his claws. Hard. \\n\\nAt first I laughed about it with the people on the call, because cats, right? But then I noticed in the thumbnail of my video that i was bleeding, and not just a little bit, but the kind of blood you get when your cat scratches your cheek from the bottom of your eyelid to your nose. It looked like I was weeping blood. I excused myself to get a tissue to staunch the flow and told the people on the call I would go off camera so they wouldn\\'t have to watch me holding a tissue to my face as I bled through the rest of the call, but they each said to stay on camera that they understood, and we continued. They asked a few more questions, I had a couple for them, and we wrapped up on a personal note about our shared hobbies. All while I was bleeding through my second tissue. \\n\\nOverall I thought the interview went well, but I could have done without the facial laceration. At least they will remember me. \\n\\n  \\nTL;DR My cat Moe kicked me in the face during a video interview. I bled like a stuck pig.',\n",

       " 'TIFU by eating a bag of edibles before a flight - only to create my own ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to Disney World!‚Äù moment, and convince TSA staff that I‚Äôm special needs. - To those of you who might have wondered if it‚Äôs worthwhile to eat a bag of edibles before boarding a flight, my experience might make you think twice. I figured that if I popped a few ‚Äúspecial‚Äù chocolates after arriving at the airport (but before going through security), I‚Äôd sink comfortably into my seat on the plane, have a great time watching a light hearted in-flight comedy movie, and painlessly arrive at my destination before I even knew it. I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong.\\n\\nInstead, I ended up living my own version of the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm goin‚Äô to Disney World‚Äù joke, making an incredible fool of myself in front of airport staff, and armed my wife with a story she loves to remind me of - she thinks it‚Äôs still just as hilarious as it was the day it happened.\\xa0\\n\\nMy wife and I had wanted to visit Disneyland as adults for years - imagining how much fun many of the classic rides there would be after a couple beers, and otherwise really just taking the time to appreciate it all in a way we probably never could have when we were kids. Earlier this year, we finally took the chance to go, and booked our tickets - excited to take a real vacation, and escape to the fantasy world of a Disney park for a few days.\\xa0\\n\\nAs the real genius I am, I figured I could only enhance the otherwise boring, uncomfortable and fairly long flight by eating a bunch of edibles once we got to the airport. I figured my timing was perfect - they wouldn‚Äôt start kicking in until after we had gotten through security, and they‚Äôd last until we arrive, and settled in at our hotel in Anaheim. Except even with my decent tolerance at the time, these particular edibles hit me like a truck, coming at me full-speed. Even after 20 minutes or so, I was already exploring space while in line at security - it took extra concentration to go through each step at the scanners, and even emptying my pockets into the tray on the x-ray conveyor belt was a real fuckin‚Äô struggle.\\xa0\\n\\nBy the time we settled into our seats by our gate, I knew I needed to find a way to shake it off. I (pretty abruptly, my wife told me later) stood up and let her know I needed to go for a walk by myself - I figured that would help keep me grounded, and focused on other things. I was also getting worried about being literally grounded - if the gate agents or any of the flight attendants figured out how absolutely blasted I was, they‚Äôd probably deny me boarding. After a few minutes, the walk was starting to help, and it was time I headed back to my gate - my boarding time was coming up, and I was going to have to hope I looked at least somewhat sober when getting on the plane.\\xa0\\n\\nLooking around the part of the airport I was in, I didn‚Äôt recognize anything around me. Glancing up to the sign above me, my stomach sank when it read ‚ÄúBaggage Claim and Taxi Pickup.‚Äù I had somehow gotten out of the departure area - I must have walked through one of those one-way gates you often go through at your destination, without even noticing. I was going to have to go back through security again, and I figured I was screwed. In my head, the TSA agent was going to know how baked I was, and they were going to tell the airline I can‚Äôt fly. As I was walking back to the security entrance, my sky-high brain was racing - jumping to the conclusion that I was about to ruin the entire trip by getting our flight cancelled, and my wife was going to be upset, disappointed, and let down. What if getting denied boarding was the last straw in a secret, long list of grievances? What if this event is the catalyst that leads to our marriage falling apart? What if that sends me spiraling into a depression that costs me my job, and I end up living alone in a cardboard box? Such are the thought paths of someone having an exceptionally bad time while absolutely schwacked.\\xa0\\n\\nI arrive back at the security checkpoint, only to seemingly have my fears confirmed. The TSA agent scanning boarding passes at the beginning of the line takes a look at me and says ‚ÄúWait a minute, didn‚Äôt you already come through here? I swear I saw you like half an hour ago. What are you doing back here?‚Äù\\xa0\\n\\nIn my state of panic, I try my hardest to come up with a casual, yet clear explanation to reply with - something a totally sober guy might say. I manage to muster up my best effort - while not even looking at the TSA agent (I thought I couldn‚Äôt let my eyes give myself away, after all!), I reply with a sentence of pure literary mastery.\\xa0\\n\\n‚ÄúUhhhh.. I dunno.‚Äù\\xa0\\n\\nExcept I didn‚Äôt even annunciate the words - I just shrugged my shoulders and sort of mumbled it, in a sing-song kind of way. And all while mostly either staring at the floor, or gazing off into the distance. She then pauses for a moment, says ‚ÄúHmm, ok then,‚Äù and asks to see my boarding pass again. She takes a quick glance at it, and asks ‚ÄúOff to LA today?‚Äù\\xa0\\n\\n‚ÄúNo, Disneyland!‚Äù I replied cheerfully. I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt just say yes (I was going to LAX) - I guess I was trying to make conversation? Beats me, now that I‚Äôm looking back on it. Right then, the TSA woman looks at me as if she had just made a grand realization - and I figure I‚Äôm screwed. She‚Äôs on to me. But instead of asking me if I‚Äôve had anything to drink, smoke, or if I was ok to fly, she completely changes her tone of voice. Now, in a happy, higher pitched but slower tone, says back to me ‚ÄúOhhh how exciting! Well if you got lost, that‚Äôs ok! We can help you get back! Then once you get to Disneyland, you‚Äôll get to have soooo much fun on all the rides!‚Äù\\n\\nMeanwhile I‚Äôm standing there, obliviously thinking to myself ‚ÄúYeah, I will have fun! Thanks, strangely friendly TSA lady!‚Äù\\xa0\\n\\nIn her now extra well pronounced, basic words, she then asks if I have anyone waiting for me at the gate - like an assistant or something. The ‚Äúassistant‚Äù question got me confused - is that some sort of policy-based question I had never heard before? I tell her a simple ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù while probably still glaring at the wall or something. She then asks if I need any extra help at security, and tells me to ‚Äúsay hi to Micky for me!‚Äù Smiling, but still freaking out and slightly confused inside, I let out a simple ‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù and go back through the scanner - I just had to get out of there as quickly as I could.\\xa0\\n\\nNow walking back towards my wife at the gate, it all hits me like a ton of bricks. The TSA agent thought I was another form of ‚Äúincapacitated‚Äù entirely - someone who rode the short bus going to school, and is now on a field trip to Disneyland with support workers and aides. Now turning beat red, I sit back down beside my wife, and before she could say anything, I blurt out: ‚ÄúThe entire security staff back there think I‚Äôm legitimately mentally handicapped.‚Äù\\xa0\\n\\nShe still looks back on that as one of her favorite moments of our marriage so far. And as it happens, the flight itself wasn‚Äôt even any better on the edibles, either.\\xa0\\n\\n**TL;DR**: I took too many edibles at the airport before a flight, and somehow wandered out of the departures area. I had to go back through security again to get back to my gate, now worried that I‚Äôd be deemed too intoxicated to fly - only to instead have TSA think I was mentally handicapped and requiring special needs assistance.\\xa0',\n",

I was in disbelief when I heard ‚Äú911 what‚Äôs your emergency,‚Äù on the other end. \\n\\nOne night before this she had been triggered by a friend of ours getting too excited in a game we were playing. (Online game, Discord chat, friend is in another state) He got a little loud but maintained a joking tone. Everyone else was laughing. After a while, she came into the same room as me and had me feel her heart and told me how much it bothered her. She has a tough past and I know she can get triggered. However, for the past 3 years she‚Äôs been very resilient, and only just now started getting really sensitive again. \\n\\nI understand I scared her but I want to emphasize that this was not a one sided thing and I have been with her for almost seven years now. For the first 99% of the conversation this was a somewhat tense and at times a little loud altercation, but nothing we haven‚Äôt had before, and something that isn‚Äôt uncommon in most relationships. We‚Äôve had louder fights where she‚Äôs said some really terrible things to me and told me she was done with me, only to act like it never happened a little while later. I regret yelling, I wish I never felt like it was yell or be misunderstood, but just try to understand yelling isn‚Äôt all the same. \\n\\nWhen I saw she was calling the cops, I calmly and promptly gathered my keys and phone and walked out of the apartment. I heard her tell the operator that she was reporting a domestic dispute. As I walked to my car I also called 911 and informed that I am apparently in a domestic dispute, told my name, my address, my appearance, my car appearance, and where I would be (just up the road.) I drove up the road and waited on the corner, sitting on the curb. \\n\\nI got a call from my dad while I waited asking if I was okay,  and he informed me she had called him saying she didn‚Äôt know where I went, that I ‚Äústormed out‚Äù and that she was packing my bags because we were through. (Mind you I moved to this area, Chicagoland area, to live with her 5 years ago, my dad live 15 hours away.)\\n\\nAs I was talking to him, carefully trying not to foul his opinion of her while also trying to let him know I‚Äôm not out of control and I‚Äôm not fully sure what‚Äôs going on, the police pulled up and began to talk to me. \\n\\nI calmly told them the story, almost broke down once, and they were actually very understanding and reassuring. They asked me if she was taking her medication and I told them I thought she was. They asked if i thought it was all right if they checked on her and I encouraged them to speak to her because I didn‚Äôt want them to only hear from me or let me talk for her. I was under the impression other officers would be in the apartment talking to her at this time. Unbeknownst to me she actually told the operator, after I had left, that she didn‚Äôt want any officers to come by and that she didn‚Äôt want anything bad to happen to me. Idk what she wanted then. Prior to the officers leaving to check on her, they told me I handled the situation exactly as I should, and that I should wait there. \\n\\nThey ended up talking to her in our apartment for about 5 minutes and she sent them back to check on me. As I waited, in my car at this time at the same location where I was sat, after a little bit, I decided to call and check on her. I asked her whether she spoke to the cops, and she said yes, that they should be on their way to me, and right on queue they pulled up behind me. They said everything was fine, and the male cop starting giving me advice on where to go from there. \\n\\nAfter they left, I went back to the apartment, and started talking to her/packing my things. The first argument started at about noon, I was out of the house by 1:30ish, and back in by about 3pm. At 9pm, she called it all off. She told me she still loved me, I apologized for everything. I told her she really scared me too, and there were maybe somethings she shouldn‚Äôt have done. Early on in our relationship I knew she could be sensitive so I always avoided yelling. At one point I was told by a therapist that I should be more willing to set boundaries in the relationship, as some of our problems were related to that. They said in most situations yelling should be avoided and I agree. But there indeed are situations where someone should increase the volume of their voice if they are being spoken over in a situation where they need to have boundaries respected or stand up for themselves. In this situation I believed the very extreme misunderstanding was just something I needed to clarify before walking away, as if I left it like that, she would have continued to believe I was trying to do something wrong. At the same time, keep in mind I‚Äôm laying in bed half awake when this started. I feel like if anything she caught me off guard and started acting strange when I was in a vulnerable position. Scaring her isn‚Äôt justified and it makes me sick to think I did, but I also cannot truthfully say this was a situation in which she would have been afraid any month prior to this one, and I cannot say I had any upper hand or advantage or that I was cornering her or in her face or anything. I was facing away from her for most of the conversation and only got up to leave the room when I  was trying to clarify right before she called them. \\n\\nWhen she called off kicking me out, I promised I wouldn‚Äôt raise my voice anymore. This isn‚Äôt a hard promise for me to make. I had done it before and only started raising my voice because I believed it was important to show controlled sternness when necessary, something I think she should be able to do as well, and something she does do.  \\n\\nAt any rate, it‚Äôs now two days later, we have been cuddling, getting food together, watching tiktoks, and she has again decided, due to a quiet disagreement before bed last night, which we spoke about very civilly and very quietly and actually quite briefly, which she can‚Äôt get out of her mind, that because we have problems sometimes, which she magnifies as ‚Äúwe have constant issues,‚Äù we are incompatible. She is now calmly kicking me out, (I didn‚Äôt unpack just in case,) sans the police. \\n\\nI love her. She was obsessed with me before we started dating and we have been in love for 6 years now. It‚Äôs just so hard to think it got like this. And I know it really seems like something must have happened but I swear she is not acting herself. I asked her a question two days ago so I could run an errand and it escalated very slowly and not even that much and she eventually decided to call the police. I don‚Äôt have a criminal record, I don‚Äôt hurt people or women or animals or anyone. It‚Äôs horrifying. I left my life to live with her. As I have been living with her, she decided she made enough money that she didn‚Äôt need me to work anymore and wanted me to take care of the dog and the house and help her out with anything. I‚Äôm always trying to find ways to help. \\n\\nAt any rate I‚Äôm now left jobless, homeless, and 15 hours away from my family in Chicago. The love of my life is acting like a different person and I feel like she only hears half of everything I‚Äôm saying. \\n\\nI wanted to marry her. If I needed to find a way to buy a ring to propose, then it was going to take time in our situation. Otherwise, I‚Äôm also not against her proposing, but she never did, despite 100% having the means. Maybe she never really wanted to despite everything. I don‚Äôt know. \\n\\nSo now I‚Äôm packing my things into my car and getting ready to leave. I don‚Äôt really know where to go or what to do except back to where I was born. It just feels like I wasted 6 years of my life, and lost all the connections and progress that I had before I moved. Before I met her I had a job and friends and I was close with my family and I had a place to live. Then I met her and gained a girlfriend and a future wife. Now I have none of it. \\n\\nTL;DR: I asked her when her medication would be ready, she misunderstood me? and we raised our voices. She called the cops. She‚Äôs breaking up with me. We‚Äôve been together for 6 years and wanted to get married. \\n\\nEdit: \\nIf anyone wants to reach out and message me they are invited to do so. I don‚Äôt want anyone to do so out of pity but more because they want to. I don‚Äôt want anyone to be burdened by it. I have my family but I can‚Äôt just talk to them about it right now. It would help to have someone check in with me‚Ä¶ thank you all for the insight\\n\\nUpdate; see extra comment \\nMade it back. Bad times were had on the drive home. It‚Äôs hard to be here. But I‚Äôm physically safe! All that matters!',\n",

       " 'TIFU by reminding the bride she used to date one of the groomsmen on her wedding day - My brother got married recently, and I served as both best man and DJ in a small, backyard wedding. I did my part to make their special day special, and I didn\\'t do too badly, but I did have one FU that made things rather awkward for the bride for a moment. \\n\\nSo, for reference, my brother and his now wife both have a very crude, raunchy sense of humor that does not acknowledge any sort of politeness or social boundaries. This is an important detail that plays an important part in my thinking. \\n\\nThe groomsmen were getting their little boutonnieres ready and pinned for the ceremony. They were all labeled with our names, and we all picked the one that matched. However, there was one labeled \"Ex.\" This label threw me for a loop, because one of the groomsmen actually was her ex, from her teenage years. The relationship didn\\'t work out, but they remained friends after breaking up, and my brother became good friends with him too. (He\\'s now dating her sister, which is rather weird, but he\\'s a good guy and everyone is okay with it, so it\\'s not my place to judge.)\\n\\nReading \"Ex\" in the label, I actually thought the boutonniere was for her ex, with a rather cheeky label. She was helping get them on the groomsmen, and I thought I\\'d be helpful and bring it to both of them since they were in the same area, getting stuff ready. However, when I brought it to them, he already had his on. I asked \"Wait, so the one with \\'Ex\\' is not for him\"? \\n\\nShe said \"No, I meant extra, not ex! ACHGGHGG! I used to date him! NOOO!\" \\n\\nI just apologized and removed myself from the situation. Luckily she forgot about it by the time the ceremony and reception happened, and I know for a fact I have more good karma than bad karma from her for playing the Cha Cha Slide and getting my usually sober self drunk at her wedding (she explicitly wanted me to). Still a bit of an awkward mistake on my part. \\n\\nTL;DR: Thought \"Ex\" on a boutonniere meant ex-boyfriend and tried giving it to the bride\\'s ex-boyfriend, but it actually meant extra. Bride retches at being reminded they used to date. ',\n",
       " 'TIFU by yelling swears at my nice mom with my kid in the car. - School pickup is a dangerous mess of cars going too fast from one million different lanes, and families trying to cross a busy road on top of it. Every day I\\'m trying not to cause or be offed by a car wreck and also not accidentally run down a family. \\n\\nToday I picked up one kid from school and my mom picked up the other. I was leaving from one parking lot with one kid in my car, and my mom, from the lot across the busy street with my other kid in her car. \\n\\nI say this with love and also frustration: my mom is someone who will make the simplest tasks infinitely difficult by trying to guess what the other person will want, and bending over backwards to try and make it easier for them.

       " \"TIFU by trying to fix my debt and keeping it a secret from my boyfriend of 5 yrs - The last week I've been wanting to tell him. We live together. I tried to pretend everything is okay cuz I want it to be and I was trying to budget to fix it. But it's as if the universe didnt want me to and kept throwing more shit at me. Everything is expensive. Like pet bills, groceries, gas, etc. Living in Cali is no joke. Can't even find a decent home with a good price anymore. Anyways, last week I couldn't stop looking at the numbers adding up. I wanted him to know but I was truly scared to ask for any kind of help. I didn't want him to be angry or disappointed in me for letting it get that way. At one point I was so close to fixing it. I was so happy. But when we moved the number ended up doubling. The vet was $380 just for shots. We had to buy some furniture so I actually had savings and that's where that went. Had to pay gas for the house. I pay for a specific medication. I never used the credit card for those things tho. It was groceries after I paid everything else off. He likes to have friends stay the weekend. I can't help but feel I need to have enough food to feed everyone. I hate asking for help. As a kid I wasn't allowed to ask for anything. And if I did it was always no with some yelling from my dad. My mom would use me for money or anything she could gets her hands on. Parents are divorced. I guess it became a bad habit to want to do it myself.

He grabbed my phone like he does once in a while to see what I like to search (like naughty things). He immediately saw my bank account when he opened my phone. We talked for 3 hours before I left for work about it. I understand why he is distraught and thrown aback. I lied to him about being okay when I wasn't and now I get to feel the betrayal that I forced upon him. I feel like a terrible person right now.

I didn't want to ruin anything for him and I am still surprised he hasn't left me yet. I can't even handle money well nor can I even ask for a hand when I need it before the situation gets worse. Why would anyone want a woman like that? I wish I would've said something sooner. I wanted to. But I let my emotions and past experiences take hold instead.

What's worse is I was still shitting. \\n\\nI non-hesitantly picked up the phone and started cleaning it frantically. It was fully covered in shit. I was kinda surprised that the phone kept working despite cleaning it with soap and water. Still, it reeks... \\n\\nI'm pretty sure there was that one guy with the same problem as me, and now I'm disgusted that I ever picked up the phone from the toilet bowl.\\nSo yeah, you as well, might want to reconsider taking your phone to the toilet.\\n\\n(5:49 AM) I had a hard time cleaning the fucking ports and it smells the most rn. \\n\\nTL;DR(6:00 AM) So what I learned from this is to never take a phone to the toilet, especially if it's a squat one. I wish for every person who takes phone to their toilets to never face a situation like me because it's disgusting as hell. \\n\\nEdit: Just for context, I am NOT going to sell the phone.

       " 'TIFU by telling my cousin that the reason I am moving is because of her husband - TW: sexual harassment\\n\\n  I (23f) have lived with my cousin Rose and her husband Dumbo (both 33) for over a year for economical reasons. We have had a lot of issues but I could handle them. 6 months ago I began to realize that Dumbo was looking at me more. I\\'ve always been sure to wear appropriate clothing in front of him and I\\'ve never even been without a bra outside of my room. Even so I noticed that his eyes were going to other places constantly like my boobs, ass or more below. I thought that it was just my imagination but just in case I started wearing around the house oversized hoodies and sweatpants and nothing body fitting, but I stilled noticed that when we would have conversations he would deliberately stare at other places. One night as I was lying on the couch laughing at a video on my phone he came up to me, asked what I was laughing at and before I could answer he bent down and put his head on my boobs at an angle he could look at the phone screen. I was in shock and I am ashamed that I just let it happen. That\\'s when I knew I had to tell someone, especially my parents, but I didn\\'t have the courage, so I stuck it out. \\n\\n   More comments were made but the one that disgusted me the most was when he said \"hey, is it me or have your boobs gotten bigger?\" I asked why the F he was looking at me that way and that he was so off for that but he just laughed. I got the courage to tell my stepmom and dad and they were both shocked. They said that I needed to move out ASAP, and that I also needed to talk to Rose about Dumbo\\'s behavior and I would also need to talk to Dumbo. It took a bit of pushing but I finally got the nerve to sit down with Rose and tell her everything that had happened and this was the reason I was moving. She said that she would talk to him but in the end this was my problem with him and I needed to fix it. I thought that after she spoke  to him he would come to me and apologize or say something at least, but that never happened. 2 days after I told Rose that I was expecting an apology on his behalf, and I was going to talk to him myself about everything. She said that would be useless because he said he was never going to talk to me again as he claims he did nothing and apologizing would mean him owning up to what I claimed happened, that both of them were going to wait until my dad was back in town so he could solve everything. He claims that I am just trying to put my family against him and ruin his reputation. I left to go to work after that, but in my mental state I forgot something and when I came back I caught her talking to her mom them talking about how they didn\\'t believe anything I had said and that the three of them would tell my parents that I\\'m trying to divide the family. With three people ganging up against me I am worried that they\\'ll manage to change my parents mind. I think I fucked up by bringing this whole thing up, I may have just ruined my whole relationship with everyone, possibly ruined a marriage, and in the end I\\'m starting to even doubt my own judgment on what could have just been a misunderstanding. I fucked up by not staying quiet. \\n\\nI\\'ll update if its requested. \\n\\nTL;DR: I fucked up by telling my cousin and my family that her husband has been inappropriate towards me, my cousin and her husband are now trying to convince everyone that i am a liar, I may have just fucked up my relationship with my whole family.',\n",
       " \"TIFU and stabbed myself in the foot with a knife - So I just posted this as a comment in askreddit but I thought I would share and expand upon it here. \\n\\nTL;DR at the bottom \\n\\nObligatory this didn't happen today but about 5 years ago. \\n\\nI had a plantar wart on my big toe that just wouldn't go away. I went to the doctor several times and it came back every time. Tried the duct tape method, tried using over the counter freezing methods. Nothing worked so I resorted to drastic measures. \\n\\nThe doctor used a special knife to cut it out before so I thought how hard could it be?\\n\\nSo I started cutting it. It was successful surprisingly. I ended up doing the same thing every few weeks without any issue to keep the monster at bay. \\n\\nMy instrument of choice was a Leatherman Wave knife. It's a knife on a multitool, and it was my sharpest blade. A pointy knife. \\n\\nThen one day I'm about to start my wart cutting routine, I already had the knife open and I just wanted to scoot a bit more toward the edge of my bed. My current position was with the wart foot propped up on the bed with my other leg in a normal sitting position. When I scooted forward my wart foot went straight up into the blade about a half inch into the bottom of my foot. \\n\\nYou know when you hurt yourself and you know it's bad? IYKYK. Well that's what it felt like. Without even looking at the injury, I hopped on one leg across the carpet and down the hall to the first aid kit. There was so much blood that it looked like a crime scene, blood drops everywhere, a small pool of blood, a couple piles of blood soaked gauze. I stopped the bleeding surprisingly, and cleaned the bathroom up. Luckily I always disinfected the knife beforehand at least. \\n\\nI winced before I left the bathroom, not from pain, but I realized I probably left a blood trail on the carpet. I opened the door. \\n\\nI didn't get a single drop of blood anywhere outside of the bathroom, not even on the sock I stabbed through. In fact nobody in my family of 5 even noticed what happened. \\n\\nI went back to my bedroom and sat on the bed in shock of what just happened. Then I looked at the clock and realized I had to go to work. I got ready, pedaled my bike to work, and worked a full 8 hour shift. \\n\\nWhen I got home I finished off the wart. You know what? It never came back. I told my family what happened about a week later to the dismay of my mother. My dad and brothers laughed about it. I still have the scar, but not the wart. \\n\\nTL;DR\\nWas cutting off a wart on my toe with a pointy knife and accidentally stabbed myself in the foot and bandaged it without anyone in my family noticing. Rode my bicycle to work minutes after. Wart never came back. \",\n",

       " 'TIFU By showing my sister my graduation photo early when I didn‚Äôt know she was drunk  - I have only knowingly seen 2 people in my life drunk and how they act. My Mom is more serious but turns into a ball of laughter when she‚Äôs drunk or she sleeps very quickly after. One of my aunts is very touchy and loud and her personality is doubled but with laughter as well when alcohol is involved. With that logic my sister thought she would be a laughing drunk as well. I tried it a few times and I was about to throw up over one drop while my sister was chugging it like a pro. Each time It was less than a spoon full. \\n\\nNow onto the story, my sister recently moved to college and when I was at my first homecoming as a senior she and my mom missed it and they were very upset, I wasn‚Äôt mad at them because they had valid reasons. My Mother is in the Navy/Military and was overseas for a few weeks during the time, my sisters college requires a train to get back home and when I first went with her that was my first time riding one that I remember, so it would be very inconvenient for her to come over here without a good reason. My Step Dad helped me pick out a suit and called my Mom to be involved with the process.\\n\\nDuring homecoming I had fun but my phone was about to lock because my mom has a parental control on my phone until I go to college. (7am-10pm for those curious) During the limit i cant contact people that aren‚Äôt my Mom or sister. My grandmother is staying over so I can have a guardian, i didn‚Äôt want her to have my number for personal reasons so I never considered her being a contact after 10pm. Well I was taking a photo and got an alert for 5 minutes left. I contacted my grandmother and explained I needed her to pick me up a little early and the screen time. I tried contacting my sister but I got no reply until I got home. ‚ÄúSorry I drunk‚Äù I started making joke texts to mess with her pretending I was drunk. Later she showed me a video of her roommates looking mad as hell while my sister was crying talking about how everyone thinks she‚Äôs fat (she‚Äôs not), and rambling about nonsense, We laughed until later on. She asked me about who I‚Äôm inviting to my graduation and I said a few people that came to mind, she said ‚ÄúWow not me huh?‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt say her name because In my mind she was by default on my list so I didn‚Äôt think about saying it for some reason. I told her my thought process and apologized then she got happy. I only told 3 people so far who I want at my graduation.\\n\\nDuring a phone call, she wanted to see my graduation photo because I was complaining about my eyes looking crossed and squinted because of the bright ass light they had. I send her the photo the next night and I get called immediately after, she is bawling her eyes out and saying ‚ÄúWhy did you show me that‚Äù She says how she doesn‚Äôt want to miss my graduation like she missed my homecoming, her roommate grabs her phone and explains how he tried to get her to drink water because she drunk an entire bottle of alcohol and how he‚Äôs never drinking with her again, he was one of the people who previously drunk with her. He was the only sane one. He gave me a 360 view of the room, my sister crying while chris cross apple sauce, a dude screaming to the top of his lungs randomly, 2 people cuddling, all while on the floor no blanket mind you, and I hear someone else crying, He then gives the phone back to my sister. I tell her how she needs to drink water but she doesn‚Äôt listen and the entire conversation is going in circles, then the random dude screams again and I lose my shit laughing because I can‚Äôt take this seriously anymore. Before she hangs up she gets very close to the camera and says ‚ÄúYou were an annoying ass little shit growing up but your my shit‚Ä¶my shit‚Ä¶‚Äù She then started praising me for how far I had come because I was genuinely an annoying kid growing up. (I don‚Äôt disagree), she gave me some of the nicest compliments I ever heard her say like how she‚Äôs proud that I‚Äôm her little brother. I also recorded some of it to show my sister but I couldn‚Äôt catch the audio since I fucked it up but I did catch the 360 view the roommate gave me. I told her I would talk to her in the morning when she was sober. I took the saying ‚Äúdrunk words are sober thoughts‚Äù into consideration. She asked me if I was sad that I had my senior year just started and my mom missed my first day, nobody came to homecoming, they might miss graduation, and how she hates how people keep missing my events.\\n\\nThe next morning I called her and the first thing I asked her was if she remembered the night before, she knew she was crying and what caused it but didn‚Äôt know the details. Me and her roommate took great pleasure in informing her because a lot more did happen, I asked if she was genuinely worried and upset about not going to my homecoming and possibly my graduation. She confirmed that she was worried about it and to the best of my ability I tried to comfort her, I told her ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if you are more upset about disappointing me by not showing up, or if it‚Äôs something else but I promise I won‚Äôt hold it against you if you have a legitimate reason for not being able to go like an emergency or exam but I do want you there if possible.‚Äù My birthday is in the same week that I graduate so even if she misses it we can hold an event shortly after. We then went back to laughing while watching drunk clips of her and I saw her mood was better after.\\n\\nTo end on a lighter note The people in the room actually started commenting when my sister started complimenting me about it how much I grown while she was bawling her eyes out the night before. This is how it went-\\n\\n(Group at once): ‚Äúawwwww‚Äù\\n\\n(Some guy): ‚ÄúDamn you old as shit Unc‚Äù\\n\\n(Sister): ‚ÄúALL YALL NEED TO SHUT UP!‚Äù\\n\\nTLDR: Showed my sister my graduation photos in advance. I was previously ranting about how my eyes were either squinting or looked crossed eyes because of the light. I don‚Äôt know she was drunk at the time. So she called me crying for half an hour and told me all her fears about missing my graduation and homecoming that the photo sparked.\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'TIFU by going to the gym. - Obligatory this happened last week. \\n\\nI (22F), had gained some weight this past summer and I decided to get healthier. Part of this was to start going to the gym. My boyfriend (20M) has been really into fitness for the last year or two and he said he could help me out and show me what to do. \\n\\nAnother important part of this story is that we didn‚Äôt actually have a membership for this gym. We are both in college and my bf‚Äôs friend has a membership and he let us take a picture of it to scan in. Perhaps what happened next was karma and I definitely learned my lesson. This was also my first (and last) time going to this gym, so overall I was pretty nervous.\\n\\nWe get to the gym and the idea is that I copy my boyfriend‚Äôs first 3 exercises and then walk on the treadmill until he finishes his workout. It is also important to note that I hadn‚Äôt done a real workout in around 6-8 months. Each exercise is 3-4 sets of 8 reps. We were doing arms so we did lat pull downs and two other machines that I don‚Äôt remember.\\n\\nThroughout the whole exercises portion I am feeling pretty good. The preworkout is coursing through my veins and I feel amazing. I also forgot to drink or eat much that day which is important. By the third exercise I‚Äôm feeling pretty tired but I push through. Since we worked out arms I feel fine to walk in the treadmill for a while and watch family guy.\\n\\nI get on the treadmill and start walking for around a minute. But my playlist was so good I just felt like jogging. I‚Äôm jogging at around 5-6 m.p.h for like 3 minutes when suddenly I don‚Äôt feel so good. I frantically try to stop the treadmill and at the same time dramatically vomit 5 times in a row onto the treadmill.  My boyfriend says when I throw up it sounds like a cartoon vomiting like super loud and dramatic. The vomit is everywhere and everyone is staring at me, except apparently, my boyfriend who was on the other side of the gym and didn‚Äôt notice. There is like a 10 second pause where everyone stares and then I vomit 5 times again.\\n\\nOne of the ladies who works at the gym came over and I was like I‚Äôm so sorry and she was like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about it. Go to the bathroom and clean yourself up‚Äù. But internally(and externally) I‚Äôm freaking out because we don‚Äôt have a membership there. I‚Äôm both nervous they would check that and I feel horrible that I threw up without even paying to go there. I tried to put like a few paper towels on it but I honestly was panicking and didn‚Äôt know what to do.\\n\\nInstead of going to the locker room I frantically run across the gym to my boyfriend, who did not notice any of this happening, and explain to him that we need to leave immediately. Once we get in the car, he almost throws up because I smell so bad so I had to attempt to clean myself up at a random gas station. I haven‚Äôt been back to that gym (or any gym tbh) since, and when I do go back to a gym I will definitely be buying a membership.\\n\\nThe one benefit from this whole situation is that me and my boyfriend have started going on daily walks, which have been really nice.\\n\\nTL;DR : I went to a gym I didn‚Äôt have a membership at and proceeded to vomit all over the place.',\n",

She\\'s got kitchy sunglasses, she has a lollypop in her mouth that she takes out and waves around as she talks. She\\'s carrying a teddy bear kind of thing attached by a strap around her mid-section, and wearing what I can only describe as a grownup version of a black and white little kids dress. She also has a large cloth bag over her arm that looks like a cross between a sack for holding kid toys (it had little toy figures as its design) and a trick or treat bag.\\n\\nSo I asked if she was on her way to a Halloween Party. \"No, why?\" she asks. Cuz of your little kid costume, I respond. She stops dead in her tracks and say, \"No, I just got off of work.\" And I\\'m pretty sure she wasn\\'t kidding.\\n\\nI quickly excused myself and hid in the backroom until she left.\\n\\nTL:DR: Asked a young woman if she was dressed for Halloween today when she was just coming home from work.

       " \"TIFU by not washing my hands after cutting a jalape√±o... and then washing my face. - So... I made a mistake. I decided to have a late night snack after work. This late night snack involved cutting a jalape√±o. After eating said snack I was ready for bed and started my bedtime routine, rubbing my eyes to get me into bedtime mode. Apparently I forgot that I was handling a jalape√±o 5 minutes ago. Suddenly my eyes were in absolute pain and I had no idea why, it hadn't dawned on me what I had done. \\n\\nSo spicy tears are running down my face and my whole face is on fire now. What do I do? I grab my makeup remover cloth and quickly get it wet and start scrubbing at my eyes to get this god-awful pain to go away. Except guess what. My hands still had jalape√±o juice on them. The wet cloth was the perfect way to transfer even more pain to my face after sucking in the spice.\\n\\n When I finally realized what was going on I tossed the rag away and just stood in my bathroom silently crying so my parents wouldn't hear me . But I still had the juice on my hands, I would have to go to the kitchen to use the dish soap. In shame I walked out to tell my parents what a dumbass I am, with swollen eyes and spicy tears still flowing. But we had just enough dish soap for me to get the jalape√±o (hopefully) off. I am too afraid to test that though. So yeah, lesson learned. Wash your hands very well after touching spicy things, don't let sleepy brain take over and forget things.\\n\\nEdit: I should add that I have learned this lesson before but it was not my eyes that were touched. I was just sleepy after a long work day and forgot to wash my hands like I usually do.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR I cut up a jalape√±o, promptly forgot, and started rubbing my eyes which resulted in ungodly pain and spicy tears to bring the pain to the rest of my face. Remember to wash your hands (even if you're super tired). :)\",\n",
       " \"TIFU by realizing I am almost definitely about to lose 4.1k - Since the end of July I have been trying to sell my Edsea balcony cabin. I bought it on impulse after last years edc cruise. It was such an amazing experience, I didn't want to miss it this year. I bought the room not knowing if I can go. We'll, I can't go. I have been trying on as many social media platforms as possible to sell this room. I came close to a few sales and everyone bails. I could have made one sale about two weeks ago. Someone told me they were interested but have another offer from someone who will also be in the room with them for 3.8k. They told me they prefer the privacy and if my offer is close to the other one, they will consider it. I asked if they could pay the 4.1k and I'll pay all the other extra fees (another 1.6k). They never responded. I reached back out to them to see if that price works or not. By this point, they told me, the other person already added them to their reservation. They got a drink package with being in the other room as well. I am really kicking myself for not just saying, I'll match the other person's price or even better, going lower than the other price. I have spoken to what feels like at least 100 ppl or more. The last day to add ppl is next week. I am screwed. I have lost 4,100 dollars. This sucks. I am an idiot. This just sucks.\\n\\nTL;DR: I got an edsea room before knowing if I could go. I can't go. I have been trying to sell it for months. It's not happening for me. I am about to lose 4.1k.\\n\\n\\nUpdate: I sold the room for $2,328. The total ended up being $5,740, after adding two people into the room. I lost $3,412. I'm trying to not think about the other offers, it's water under the bridge. At least I sold it and got something versus nothing. Thank you for all of the feedback everyone. I hoped I learned my lesson. I cannot imagine that I will make an impulsive purchase like this again. \",\n",
       " \"TIFU by listening to a doctor about an elective surgery - I've had vericose veins in my leg since my early 20s, I'm in my mid 40s now. My new primary care doctor was concerned about them because of a spot on my ankle that she thought was caused by the veins. She convinced me to take a referral to a vascular surgeon. \\n\\nI met with the VS who told me how much better my life could be if I had the veins addressed. They told me how bad the flow was in those veins. They said they used to do a painful procedure to basically rip the veins out. However, now they had a procedure where they run something up the vein and burn it with a laser. \\n\\nThey assured me I would be fine after a day or two. It wasn't a difficult surgery or recovery, and that I would be able to return to work the day after the surgery.  \\n\\nTo be clear, I'm not some wimp when it comes to pain. I had MACI knee surgery on the same leg a little over two years ago. This surgery they were suggesting should be nothing compared to that. \\n\\nSo Friday morning I had the surgery. I was pretty okay Friday for the most part. Saturday I was a little sore, but still went to work. Sunday was more pain, I missed work, and tried to take a day to take care of myself. Then this morning I got woke up by severe pain about 4AM. It's been severe pain all day. The doctor had prescribed me pain pills. After my MACI I took one, felt sick, never took another. I just sucked it up and dealt with the pain. Today I've taken 5 of the hydrocodone they prescribed, and still can't walk without a crutch. I missed work again today, something I never do. \\n\\nIt's put me in such severe pain that I called the doctor's office to see if they could see me sooner. The doctor's office then informs me that what I'm going through is often normal, nothing to worry about, and to keep my leg elevated and move around as much as I can. That I just need to get through it.  I wasn't very nice because of the severe pain, I'm not trying to be rude it is just hard. I said, the doctor said one or two days at most. They then told me when the veins are really bad like mine were(a nurse the day of surgery said mine were the worst she's ever seen) this isn't unusual.  Basically they told me to suck it up and not be a wimp. So now I get to enjoy the worst physical pain of my life until it just finally is over, hopefully soon. The doctor is now waiting 5-7 days.\\n\\nTo top that off. If I want an appointment before my scheduled follow up this coming Friday they want me to get another ultrasound of my leg. A leg that hurts severely over a light touch. There is no way in hell I'm letting them push that little wand into my leg, I would probably pass out from pain. \\n\\nTLDR - TIFU by listening to a doctor to get an elective procedure they said would be pretty easy with two day recovery at most. Now I'm sitting here, 4 days later, in the worst pain of my life, wishing they would just cut my leg off, doped up on hydrocodone that makes me feel sick to my stomach, wishing it were just over, but realizing I've still probably got 2-3 more days of hell.

I get home to my city and go to fuel it up - and see a homemade label stuck to the inside of the fuel flap that my Koro made as his memory was slipping ‚Äúpremium 95‚Äù oh shit. Ring my kuikui, ring mechanics and auto parts stores. All of them say nope‚Ä¶91 seems about right (‚Äúif it runs well it‚Äôs likely the right grade‚Äù)! my kuikui says ‚Äúof course he put the wrong label he can‚Äôt remember shit‚Äù lol. \\n\\nSo years go by, literal YEARS and every now and again I look at that label and get anxious I‚Äôm putting the wrong gas in. Behind the homemade label is an English gas label that says ‚Äúpremium unleaded only‚Äù (implying 95) but the Japanese labels translate to ‚Äúunleaded only‚Äù (implying 91).

       " \"TIFU when scratching my balls  - I know what you're thinking, how does one fk up when scratching their balls? Well here's the story. It wasn't today but a few days ago. It all started when I laid down after a long day and a warm shower to watch some YouTube in bed and go to sleep. As a degenerate, I had my vape next to me which I was fidgeting with while watching a video. All was well until I felt an itch and itch that could not be scratched by just shifting around in bed an itch that needed the old patented pinch-and-roll technique. So I went for it. Little did I know that my vape had leaked a bit of juice onto my designated itching hand and when I made contact with the soft flesh of my scrotum I felt it. It was like nothing I had felt before, an arctic breeze in my balls, a cold that was so severe it felt as if all was going to burn. I lay there shifting myself around attempting to wipe off any of the nic from the area with my free hand. The sensation became unbearable and I ran to the bathroom and attempted to wash myself with soap and water but it was too late. The nicotine was too deep all I could do was wait out the chilling buzz that was engulfing my family jewels. after 10 min it was all over. I was free. \\n\\nTL;DR Nicotine juice on hands + itchy balls is not a good combo\",\n",
       " 'TIFU by stealing more McDonald\\'s caramel sauce than any one person could consume in a dozen lifetimes - tl;dr:  I stole a LOT of caramel syrup that was stacked up outside a Mcdonald\\'s near my house.  Found out that it\\'s not all that tasty in bulk and doesn\\'t go down a sink without protest.  \\n\\nSo when I was a teen (not \"today,\") I used to live not far from a McDonald\\'s.  \\n  \\nI was on the HS swim team, and practices were held at the horrible hour of 5AM.  My parents were less than enthusiastic about dropping me off that early, so I had to get up at 4AM just to bike there.  Cutting through a gap in the fence of the McDonald\\'s store\\'s parking lot saved me a couple of blocks, so I would force my bike through the hedge and go on my sad, lonely way.  \\n  \\nThere were several days where I\\'d see huge stacks of buns and other stuff outside the store\\'s side entrance.  I don\\'t know if there was some kind of drop-off from trucks, or daily delivery or whatever.  I suppose (although I never checked) that the delivery was only for non-perishables.  There must have been some other arrangement for things like meat, eggs, produce, etc.  The timing was odd, but maybe the truck had an early route, and that was the first store?  Hard to say.  For reasons that will become obvious, I never asked.  \\n  \\nOne day, I noticed the stack of supply pallets had a bunch of #10 cans on them.  When I got closer, I saw the label identifying them as the gooey caramel sauce that McDonald\\'s used for their sundays.  I liked that shit.  It was awesome.  It being just after 4:00AM, my brain wasn\\'t working all that well, so I decided I would take one of them with me to school and me and my teammates would eat it with a spoon.  Best day ever!  \\n  \\nBut then I thought: What if we eat *all* of the syrup?  That would leave none for me when I had ice cream at home.  Who was I to deny my family *their* share of tasty caramel sundays?  Solution:  Zip on home and get something more cargo capable than a tricked-out Schwinn with a banana seat and chopper handlebars.  \\n  \\nIn all of five minutes, our family\\'s Dodge Dart was loaded down with ten #10 cans of caramel syrup.  I drove it home, made as little noise as I could unloading and hiding the cans, and then booked it back to school on my bike.  \\n  \\nStealing what was probably a couple of months\\' worth of sunday topping for a single McDonald\\'s is probably enough to qualify as a FU, but I\\'ve found that this subreddit expects consequences, even if they aren\\'t all that consequential.  There were several.    \\n  \\nThe first thing I realized after successfully pulling off the one and only \"heist\" of my abbreviated criminal career was that you really couldn\\'t open one of those #10 cans without somewhere to put all the stuff inside of it.  I could maybe consume a couple of spoonfulls of caramel syrup at a time.  Any more than that, and it started tasting awful.  Deliciously awful, but still awful.  So that left the problem of what to do with the rest of the syrup.  \\n  \\nSo on the first day I decided to enjoy the fruits of my juvenile delinquency, I ended up attempting to pour the majority of a #10 can of McDonald\\'s caramel syrup down my family\\'s bathroom sink.  Fun fact: caramel syrup does not go gently into that good night. It clogged up the sink almost immediately, leaving me in the ONE bathroom in our tiny single-family abode with a mostly full #10 ten can of thick vanilla-flavored goodness, a sink filled about 1/3 of the way up with the rest of it, and a growing line of siblings pounding on the door clamoring to get in so they can pee.   \\n  \\nRunning hot water into the sink only helped a tiny bit.  It diluted the syrup IN the sink but did nothing to unclog what must have been the world\\'s largest Heath Bar lodged in the P-trap under the vanity.  Even the plunger had no effect.  In desperation, I used my cupped hands to transfer as much syrup and brownish sweet water from sink to toilet, flushing as often as the tank would fill up.  \\n  \\nThe sink mostly emptied, I then attempted to clean up.  But we kept cleaning supplies in the linen closet OUTSIDE of the bathroom, so all I had on hand were towels and toilet paper.  I didn\\'t dare try to use the towels- my mom would have killed me!  So I tried using the toilet paper.  Which is when I learned that caramel syrup sticks to counters, toilet seats, walls, floors, etc. much harder than it sticks to toilet paper.  All I really managed to do was add a layer of Charmin to the mess on every surface between sink and toilet.  \\n  \\nFinally, faced with a \"Heeeeere\\'s Johnny!\" moment from a pair of angry siblings, I opened the door.  My older brother took one look at the place and said \"holy fuck! What were you doing in here?  Did you shit in the sink?\"  Which, to be fair, was a reasonable first impression for someone seeing brown smears all over sink, counter, and toilet seat.  \\n  \\nWhich led to my *real* Fuck Up of the day:  I just went with it.  Somehow, it made more sense at the time to confess to blowing out the sink\\'s pipes with an enormous load of feces than to admit that I had stolen a giant can of McDonald\\'s caramel syrup.  Value judgements were not my forte at the time.  \\n  \\nI don\\'t remember what lame excuse I made.  \"Yeah, the toilet was clogged, so I didn\\'t have any choice,\" I probably said.  And then I grabbed some Formula 409 out of the linen closet and started spraying it everywhere, despite my brothers\\' increasingly agitated peepee dances.  \\n  \\nNever the brightest bulbs in the shed, they both accepted my lame explanation, satisfied perhaps with an admission of guilt and the potential for giving me a hard time about shitting in the sink.  Which they did for many decades, often, and with great enthusiasm.  And so I became that one weird cousin who shits in the sink.  \"Don\\'t let /u/Leftunder use your bathroom!  He\\'ll shit in your sink!\" they\\'d say whenever we visited the aunts &amp; uncles.  Of course, I\\'d be helpless to defend myself.  \"It was really just a lot of caramel syrup\" would have demanded too much awkward explanation.    \\n  \\nAnd there was a third, less impactful consequence:  When I bragged about my haul to my closest fellow teenage reprobates, one of them made the astute observation that those #10 cans were probably super expensive.  I forget the math, but we concluded that I had committed the equivalent of grand theft auto in McDonald\\'s caramel syrup.  So instead of getting to enjoy the fruits of my labor, we ended up opening just one more can, each spooning out enough to make us physically ill, and then dumping out the rest in the woods.  Somewhere there is a dynasty of ants worshiping the Divine Provider that poured the manna from heaven that fed their colony for untold generations.  \\n  \\nOh, and add one more:  After the wake-up call of realizing I had committed a felony, I decided that cutting through the McDonald\\'s parking lot wasn\\'t a good idea, nor was being noticed as the one guy riding a bike at 4:30AM every day.  The ace detective they assigned to solve the Great Syrup Caper of 1978 would surely put 2&amp;2 together, and all it would take is one blood sugar reading to prove my guilt.  So I quit the swim team.  Which wasn\\'t all that big of a deal since I was a shitty swimmer and actually hated getting up that early anyway.',\n",

       " 'TIFUpdate: when I removed my dentures during sex - I never planned to use this account again, but here I am anyway. It\\'s been a couple of years since my last post, so let me provide a recap. About 2 years ago I had my first threesome with my friend and his gf. Mid sex, specifically oral sex, my dentures slipped out while I was going down on my friend\\'s gf. I\\'ve been wearing dentures for most of my life due to an accident that left me with missing teeth. I downplayed the awkward atmosphere in the bedroom with a joke. I said I heard that gummy BJs are the best BJs. My friend made it very clear that he had no interest in getting a regular BJ from me, much less a gummy BJ. The three of us laughed about it and continued with the threesome. However, my friend\\'s gf asked if I was willing to go down on her without my dentures so that she could feel what toothless cunnilingus was like. \\n\\nI was like why not, so I embraced my most unattractive form and ate her out with no dentures. I never got the impression that she was not enjoying it, until my friend informed me the following day that I fucked up when I removed my dentures during oral sex because it was off-putting for him and his gf, even though the two of them acted like it wasn\\'t. I said I was sorry, and it seemed like my friend accepted my apology, but our friendship was never the same again. In fact, as of now, I would say there\\'s nothing left of our friendship. So, considering the fact that I basically lost a friend because of a threesome, I was like fuck threesomes. Never again. Until a month ago. My gf and I were having a random discussion about past relationships and some of the kinky things we\\'ve done with previous partners, and that was when my gf found out about the threesome I had. And she got excited. Like, really excited.\\n\\nShe was keen to invite another person into our bedroom. Girl or guy. Whatever worked for both of us. She said she always wanted to have a threesome but she\\'s never been with someone she trusted enough to actually do it with. Until me. Her enthusiasm was infectious. Before I knew it, I was all in. The two of us decided to go with a girl as our third person. The girl was someone my gf and I crossed paths with at a club in Cape Town while we were on holiday in South Africa. Towards the end of our holiday, the threesome happened. It was hot at first. No hiccups. Not until the moment came when I was laying naked on my back while my gf was sitting on my face and the Capetonian girl was going down on me. I automatically removed my dentures while my gf was on top of my face. I always eat her out with no dentures. She likes it that way. I fucked up twice at that point without even knowing it.\\n\\nFirst, I failed to warn the other girl, who was unaware that I had dentures, that I was gonna remove my fake teeth during oral sex. Second, I failed to remember that I was totally toothless from that moment onwards. The combination of both of these fuck ups created an unexpected jump scare when we eventually switched positions and the other girl suddenly saw me without my teeth. She screamed her lungs out and literally leaped off the bed. I didn\\'t understand what was happening until my gf, who seemed to be on the verge of laughing hysterically, nudged me with her elbow and said babe put your teeth back in your mouth. I was like shit, my bad, and grabbed my dentures. The other girl regained her composure and repeatedly said sorry for the way she reacted. I said it was all my fault and promised to keep my teeth where it belonged for the rest of the threesome, assuming that everyone was still keen to continue.\\n\\nWe continued. I thought it was a fun night. But just like my last threesome a couple of years ago, the following day changed everything. I overheard the other girl talking on the phone with someone. She was standing on the balcony with her back towards the glass door. I was in the living room, looking for my phone charger, trying to mind my own business. My gf was still sleeping. It was really early. I missed the beginning of the conversation, but I did catch the other girl telling the person on the phone that she struggled to fall asleep because apparently our bed was not big enough for 3 people, which I thought was kind of funny. I stopped smiling when she said I looked like the bad guy in Skyfall without my dentures. I used what little battery life I had left on my phone to Google \"bad guy in Skyfall\" and the results on Google images totally obliterated my self confidence. When I looked up from my phone, the other girl was facing the glass door, which scared the shit of me, but it became clear that she couldn\\'t see inside. \\n\\nI eavesdropped for another 2 minutes before I returned to the bedroom with a potent dose of post threesome trauma. The last 2 minutes of unfiltered gossip I exposed my ears to was basically the other girl telling whoever she talking to that she would\\'ve had more fun if she was alone with my gf because she was unable to unsee my gummy grin for the rest of her life and that pretty much killed the possibility of an orgasm during our threesome. Like I said, I tapped out after 2 minutes. My confidence could take no more. I shared none of this with my gf or the other girl. Random people on the internet can know that I know, but no one who knows me must know. So there it is. My second threesome in 2 years. Why fail once when failing twice feels so much worse. \\n\\nTL:DR Two threesomes in 2 years. Lost a friend during the first threesome due to my dentures. Gained insecurities during my second threesome due to my dentures. Translation of the latter: my gf and I had a threesome with another girl, who unexpectedly saw me without my dentures during sex and then very expectedly got a huge fright. The following morning I overheard the other girl talking to someone on the phone and telling that person that my toothless look totally killed her orgasm, leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth, and of course, fake teeth.\\n',\n",

It\\'s weird but I couldn\\'t make this shit up to save my life. \\n\\nWhen I was about 14, I awoke to the sounds of our front door being knocked at the ungodly hour of about 1am &amp; then voices. My mum came upstairs and said our neighbour was in a bit of a state about his dog and she couldn\\'t understand much of what he\\'d said &amp; got me up to go help her (dad was working a night shift). We went 3 doors up to the neighbour\\'s house, they were Polish migrants from the war (he\\'d captained a boat at Dunkirk) and spoke just a smattering of English, most of it we (us kids) imagined as shouting Polish obscentites at his dog to come back from the field behind our houses. It wasn\\'t a friendly dog, it would bark at us and it was we might call in the UK (back then anyway) a bit of a \"fat woofer\", none of that \\'chunky\\' euphemism back then. \\nOn reaching their house we saw the dog in the front garden, whilst the wife was sobbing in the doorway with the husband holding her. Mum and I went over to the dog and it had passed away (insert Monty Python dead parrot sketch excerpt). But........my Mum has British middle class manners, manners with a heavy dose of British reserve and a cheeky bit of insanity thrown in. I whispered to her \"Mum, the dog\\'s dead\", she hissed back \"ssssh pick him up, move his legs and we\\'ll see if he wakes up, we have to do something to help them \"....so we picked up the pooch and in the style of a pair of demonic renanimators, \"walked\" him by his legs by hand across the garden. After about 6ft of this ungodly Punch and Judy show, I told my mum I was knackered, she whispered to me to put him down and curl him up. She then went over to the couple and told them he was sleeping and to take him to the vets tomorrow, she then grabbed me and we hoofed it away el pronto. \\n\\nBut it only occurred to me some 40 odd years later, there might have been what we now call a \"comms issue\", with them being Polish with a limited English vocabulary and they quite possibly knew the dog was dead all that time and my mum had made me carry out this therapy-inducing act rather than ask them what they wanted us to do. Me? I just went back to bed and thought nothing of it, crazy shit like this happened all the time in 70\\'s/80\\'s. \\n\\nTLDR mum thought picking up a neighbours dead dog and moving him might ressurect him',\n",

       " 'TIFU by accidentally using the wrong restroom - (actually several years ago) I had to pee really bad as my wife and I walked into the Kohl‚Äôs department store, so I made a beeline for the restrooms which are next to the customer service desk.  I was breaking out in a cold sweat I had to pee so bad, and as I approached the service desk area, I looked up and saw the restrooms beyond the corner, and I saw ‚Äúmen‚Äù above a doorway.  Head back down so people wouldn‚Äôt see the sweat and panic on my face, I entered the restroom.  ‚ÄúHmm, that‚Äôs weird‚Ä¶they removed all the urinals?

After only a few seconds of leaving the office and walking towards the back of the zoo I had a honestly beautiful female guest walk up and ask essentually if I remembered them.

I'm a military brat and as such I lived in various states over the course of my life. She kept trying to jog my memory but it wasn't working if she was right and that we have met before.\\n\\nHonestly what was going on in my head at the time was that I has a task todo, and I wanted to complete before any questions were asked. The guest in question was even trying to convince me to come meet her mother who was on the other side of the area we were at. At which point I explained that I had work todo and said my goodbye. In retrospect I should have gone and asked her Number or even gone with her to see their mother.

       " \"TIFU by testing the limits of condom in a hot tub with my GF at the time - Inspired by someone else's condom-related F up I recalled this gem from my early adulthood.  I must have been about 20 and home from University for the summer staying with my parents who had a hot tub.  I was often alone at the house as they bounced around between travel, hobbies and social life so I and my girlfriend had the run of the house.  There was no hiding, prudishness or subterfuge around our relationship - just the regular old don't-ask-don't-tell and be-respectful of the house expectations.  \\n\\nWell we were being goofy one night and decided to test the limits of our prophelactics perhaps based on a commercial showing how much fluid and weight they could contain IIRC... so naturally, science time!   I even went out of my way to retreive the condoms from the house (just to make it clear, just how much we had no intention of having intercourse in the hot tub - thanks Sue Johansen for letting us know that wasn't a good idea).  Anyway, we tested a few and I may have worn one on my head; or tried at least.  \\n\\nAnyway.  I forgot to clean up the wrappers I guess and I slept in. Blargh. \\n\\n(Germaphobe) Mum got up early, and I came down in a great mood to a VERY sour face. Have you ever tried in the most sincere and reassuring way that you can muster to explain to your mother that the thing that looks like happened, really, really didn't?  The more you try the less genuine it seems.  Even to yourself.  Occum's razor, am I right? Which is really frustrating because even I think hot-tub intercourse sucks, and even if I did do it, there probably would not have been a condom involved.  Never saw mum in that tub again, but surprised it wasn't drained. \\n\\nTL;DR wanted to test the hydrological limits of condoms with my GF at the time in a hot tub.  No sex took place, but forgot the wrappers so mum who owned the house thought I had seeded the hot tub (and GF) with my tadpoles.  I had not, but it's a losing battle to plead innocence.

My wife and I have put the kids to bed early and we're enjoying dinner with some great conversations. I share how biking to work was so great when I realize that I did not bike home that day. I had caught a ride home from the gym and had forgotten about my bike (locked) at the bike rack outside my gym. The city I live in is notorious for bike thef. I've had two stolen in the past personally.  It's only 8pm however so we feel there's a good chance the bike is still there. \\n\\nHere's our first FU.

We quickly typed up the instructions describing the bike and LOCK COMBO. We hastily sent it out before we realize that we basically gave all the drivers nearby the code to my fancy road bike. We did have a driver accept but cancel after he read the note. He mentioned that no one would pick up because the package is not packed correctly. Of course. \\n\\nHere's our second FU.

I make it to the gym without incidents. At the same time I feel that the gummy is peaking. My head is warm and spinny. I can barely stand up straight and I needed shelter quickly. There was no way I was getting back inside an uber. I did somehow manage to make it to my office before I threw up in the bathroom. I can't remember much of it but I think I threw up another 6-7 times and napped as much as I could on the bathroom floor inbetween. As soon as I'm done I would feel sick again.

       " 'TIFU by doing yardwork - The title does imply that this was today but it is more appropriate to stand for \"Thursday I f*Ed up\" because it took me some time to realize just how badly I f*Ed up.\\nSo, it was a painfully hot summer and fall has been nowhere to be found, therefore the hedges in the front yard were monstrous from neglect. I decided that it was cool enough in the mornings to go out and tackle those bad boys and be in before it started getting to warm. I put on zip up jacket over my t shirt, to protect from bug bites and such and went to work. Behind the hedges, and growing up around the windows were these annoying invasive unsightly vines. So I started pulling them off the house and using the electric trimmer to chop them up. Everything seemed to fine. I went inside and immediately showered and washed my clothes.\\nThe next morning my hand was terribly itchy, and I assumed I had gotten a bug bite or two. But later that morning my eye was also incredibly itchy. It seemed to get worse and worse throughout the day. Saturday morning I noticed some hives on my forearms. I have autoimmune issues, so a bug bite can cause me to break out in hives sometimes. However, my eye was starting to get pretty swollen and I was super itchy. The rash kept spreading and getting worse and by Monday morning I looked like Quasimodo, I could barely open my eye and my whole face was swollen and red. I was so freaking confused and worried. It wasn\\'t until today that all the hives on my hands and arms were covered in the world\\'s grossest bubble wrap (blisters everywhere) that I had a flashback to that time I got poison ivy as a teenager. I ran outside and used Google Lens on the vines that still remained and it came up... \\nPoison Ivy.\\nWhat the actual heck? I literally did not know that poison ivy can grow up your house in vines (although I should have, duh, IVY). So my dumb ass was pulling and chopping up poison ivy vines without gloves. And somehow it not only penetrated my jacket but it managed to get through my bra and t shirt as well. This is a painful but well received lesson to learn\\n\\nPics might me NSFW but here are some of the worst spots, although I do have it near my groin too:\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/rWvmlc6\\n\\nTL;DR\\nToday I fucked up by ignorantly pulling down poison ivy vines with my bare hands and I am now covered in regret\\nand blisters',\n",

       " 'TIFU By Frying the Filet O\\'Fish patties in the cherry pie fryer. With bonus McDonalds FU - Oblig:  This happened a long time ago, back when McDonalds used to fry their cherry pies into crispy crusted morsels of heaven instead of microwaving them into limp blobs of disappointment.  So technically It\\'s more of \"That One Time I Fucked Up.\"  \\n  \\nThe proper forms have been satisfied.  Let\\'s move on.  \\n  \\nMy first day as a McDonalds employee, I was given the easy assignment of working the less busy fry station.  Back then, fish sandwich patties were dropped in oil and fried until golden crisp.  So were the cherry pies, but they were fried in a separate vat for obvious reasons.  Some genius decided to put these two fry vats next to each other.  Another genius came along and decided to not put labels on either of them.  To be fair, I believe the frozen patties and pies were stored in separate freezers next to their respective vats (flanking the conjoined vats, as it were).  \\n  \\nBeing new, I had no idea which was which.  So when the manager yelled \"drop six pies!\" across the counter top, I did exactly that:  I put six frozen cherry pies into the little rack that held them and dropped the rack and pies into the fry vat.  The Filet O\\'Fish fry vat to be precise.  \\n  \\nA few minutes later, a half dozen beautiful bubbly crusted cherry pies emerged, golden brown and seemingly delicious.  They sold immediately, so I was told to do it again.  Which I did.  Nice job, /u/tillerman35!  You\\'re our best new employee ever!  (That\\'s what I thought I would hear in a few minutes)  \\n  \\nIt didn\\'t take long for customers to storm the counter asking to speak to the manager.  Apparently, frying cherry pies in oil that had previously held a day\\'s worth of frozen fish patties imparts a certain piquant flavor to the pies.  Cod-flavored cherry pies might be a thing in some countries.  I don\\'t know.  I\\'ve never checked.  But it wasn\\'t something midwestern American palates were accustomed to.  Perhaps I was a bit too avant garde.  \\n  \\nSo that\\'s how I learned how to drain and refill a fry vat on my first day working at McDonalds.  All the customers who complained got their money back and a fresh hot cherry pie.  Those who left with take-out pies probably suffered, for which I\\'ve felt some residual guilt over the years.  If you were at a McDonalds and got a fishy tasting cherry pie, it was probably my fault and I apologize.  \\n  \\ntl;dr:  Put the frozen cherry pies into the fish fryer.  Made fishy pies.  People complained.  My bad.  \\n  \\nBonus FU:  One time, after I had graduated to burger flipper, I wrapped wet grill towel in cheeseburger paper and put it under the warmer as a joke.  I had intended to trick my fellow employee, who was about to go on lunch break (we were allowed one free burger).  But before I could slap the fake burger on a tray for him, someone snagged it, put it in a bag, and handed it to a drive-through customer.  \\n  \\nWe never saw the customer again.  Somewhere, there\\'s a person still pissed off that McDonalds sold the a soggy, hot, greasy, linen towel in place of a cheeseburger.  Honestly, as a former McDonalds employee I can state with full confidence that they got the better tasting option.  Still, it wasn\\'t what they expected, and I hope that person would accept my sincere belated apology.',\n",

       " 'TIFU by turning on a solid green light when a pedestrian was crossing. (Nobody was hit but I feel awful) - Today I was coming home and was in a right lane. There is a right turn I use to go home near a convenience store. I have used it many times for at least five years. There are zebra crossing lines where Pedestrians can walk in the lane I was about to turn into, but I never really noticed it. In fact, until today I never saw a pedestrian cross whenever I was about to turn, I guess I was lucky. In fact, I didn\\'t even know what those lines were until I got home.\\n\\n  \\nAnyway, onto what happened. I was turning basically on autopilot as soon as the light was green like I have many times before and suddenly I see a pedestrian crossing same street as that lane, taking me by surprise because it had never happened to me before in this particular turn. This person was staring forwards, and I stepped on the brakes, hoping that enough of my car was off the street so that the people behind me before I turned wouldn\\'t smash into whatever part of my car was sticking out of the lane I had just begun to turn into. The guy was soon out of the way, and I stared ahead, hands clenching the wheel the whole way home.

I am also glad that the back of my vehicle likely wasn\\'t sticking out into the same lane as the traffic light I\\'d used to turn in the first place, blocking people or worse forcing them to stop to avoid getting banged on the side.\\n\\n  \\nI still feel guilty. Is the whole thing my fault or should the pedestrian have checked both sides to see if anyone was coming before crossing? How likely is it that the police or courts will come for me for a traffic violation?\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s a thing I do a lot, worrying about how past events that could have gone differently or didn\\'t happen at all and how my life could\\'ve changed by them. This was most recent so I\\'m wondering, \"What if I hit the guy and he died? If he didn\\'t die? What would my punishment be if I stayed and called 9/11? Could I have been imprisoned for years or even executed for his death?\" Or \"What if the other cars in the lane I used to turn kept coming and my car hadn\\'t fully turned, would they have stopped in time or would they all crash in this massive pileup?\" I\\'ve been doing it more and more these days and I truly am scared that the day I fuck up in a way I can\\'t take back might come.

We had a few massive fights and I didn\\'t know how to handle my feelings about them so I ended up forwarding our private conversations to a whole bunch of people, some friends, some acquaintances.

       " 'TIFU by wrongly accusing someone of theft - I run a gaming center. Six guys played for three hours. As I was closing the center at the end of the night, I realized a controller was missing. I checked my CCTV and noticed that the last person who used the controller had just placed it on the couch. It was a black controller on a black couch, so it was perfectly camouflaged in the CCTV footage. After the game, one of the six guys placed his bag on the couch and put his black water bottle in it. As he was doing this, another guy stood directly between him and the camera, so his movements weren\\'t clearly visible. However, I saw him turn the bag, pick a small black object off the couch, and place it inside the bag. I immediately suspected that it was him.\\n\\nYou have to understand that controller theft is quite common here. I\\'ve caught some twelve people in the last six months. That\\'s why I collect IDs and contact numbers.\\n\\nI called the guy, but he didn\\'t pick up. I tried three more times, and he hung up on me the last time. This led me to conclude that it was him. So I sent him a text explaining the situation and gave him time to call me back, or I would file a complaint with the police. He called me back and denied all my accusations. I thought he was lying but he was so confident that it made me doubt myself. I felt extremely guilty, so I went back to the CCTV footage and reviewed everything for five more hours. Finally, I found the real culprit. I was devastated. The small object that the guy placed in his bag was a second smaller black water bottle.\\n\\nThe guilt of wrongly accusing someone was unbearable. I explained everything in a text to him, apologizing profusely.\\n\\nThe only text I received back was, \"bro, think twice before you blame someone.\" That was it. I apologized again, but there was no reply. I called, but he didn\\'t pick up.\\n\\nI feel terrible about what I did. I jumped to conclusions, and an innocent person got hurt. I can\\'t forgive myself.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nTL;DR : A controller went missing in my gaming center. My cctv footage wasn\\'t clear. Saw one guy place something in his bag. Jumped to conclusion that it was my controller. Confronted him over the call and he denied all my accusations. I reviewed the cctv footages again for 5 hours and found the real culprit.

MIL had a friend who was a long time secretary/office manager for the owner of a small but very successful commercial copier/printer company. They had an opening in management that would have been a dream for me at the time. She was able to get me an interview immediately with the owner. \\n\\nAlways hated job interviews. Get more nervous for those than literally anything. Pair that with how much I wanted this gig‚Ä¶ I was a mess going in. \\n\\nShow up the day of. Meet the owner and I‚Äôm 1 on 1 with him in his office. Guys mid 50s, easy to talk to, cool dude. Interview is super relaxed, he‚Äôs laughing telling examples of things, even light heartedly cursing a couple times. I‚Äôm still nervous on edge, but got more comfortable as it went on. \\n\\nThing was doing great, seemed like I was nailing it, then towards the end he says ‚ÄòI ask this of everyone I interview, what‚Äôs your go to ice breaker joke?‚Äô I still distinctly remember my rear end legitimately puckering up. I froze. Mind went blank. I don‚Äôt really tell jokes. I don‚Äôt really know any, and certainly don‚Äôt have a go to one.

Just one of dozens of one liners she‚Äôs dropped. \\n\\nSo we saw her at a kids bday party of all places a few days prior, and she greets us with this calamity of a joke‚Ä¶. \\n\\n‚ÄòWhat is another term for ejaculating in a woman?

Sure enough in my panic, frozen state, feeling dizzy and potentially close to fainting, my mind identified that moment and that ‚Äòjoke‚Äô, and it just came out. The mix of my hysteria with the relaxed vibes the owner was giving out apparently gave my brain the idea that telling this joke was the move. I never talk like that. Like ever. It must have been just a last grasp of my subconscious to fill his request. \\n\\nHe stared at me for a few seconds. Had a look like a mix of astonishment and disgust. Finally just said ‚Äòok then, well thanks for coming in‚Äô. Stood up, shook my hand and opened the door for me. I walked out and the door shut right behind me. I just kept walking, through the rest of the office and out the front door straight to my car, got in, immediately pulled out and got out of there. I stopped at a convenience store a few minutes down the road, parked and just sat there, incredulous. \\n\\nNot only did I not get the job, which based on the interview up until that point I likely had a great chance at getting, but also I had to face my MIL, who obviously was told by her friend what happened.

       " 'TIFU by letting my family manipulate me - TIFU when yesterday (I know, not today) I moved out of my apartment that I had been living in with my fianc√©, and telling her we were over. My mother and brother had breakfast with me the day of the break up and told me that my fianc√© was not right for me. I have been living with her for 8 months and have seen my family minimally because they live a couple hours away. Anyway, they kept telling me that I need to leave her because they claimed she was destroying my life, manipulating me, and not giving effort in the relationship. All to get to the point of me breaking up with her. I took my puppy from the apartment as well as all my possessions to my parents house, where I left originally because I was tired of the way they treated me. I (21M) moved out with my fianc√© (19F) to start our lives together, but now we are split up. I am living at my parents house and she is living at the apartment. I went to have a conversation with my fianc√© about moving forward, and to bring up the things my family wanted me to talk with her about: Taking over my own phone plan and splitting from hers, splitting rent down the middle instead of our budget schedule, and getting her car key back because the car is loaned and registered in my name, she is an insured driver of it. This all came to a screeching halt when I realized that ‚Äúwoah, I‚Äôm allowed to have my own thoughts and feelings‚Äù and I spoke with my fianc√© that we need to take some time to process the last year we had been together, and sort out some of our faults on our own time.

My mother wants me to ignore my fianc√© and to cut her off entirely as all my mother cares about is the money behind it.

I argue that we are doing well for our age, but I do not know how to take the next step. I want to sort things out with myself to come back better for my fianc√©, but I do not want to be in the tyrannical home of my parents and be trapped mentally and emotionally by my family. I feel that if I choose to go live a good life with my fianc√©, my family will shut me out and have a grudge against me for the rest of my life.

At this point, I was checking her arms and legs to see if she was injured, it seemed that she just tripped and quickly recovered. She was wearing a helmet, too, so it didn‚Äôt seem like she had any serious injuries.

I started to get a pit in my stomach, it was so genuine. \\n\\nDread churning inside, me I tried to continue the conversation, mentioning probably having to be in a big city like New York or San Francisco, both of which are well over 1000 miles from where we live.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nAnd then he hits me with ‚ÄúWell, when we move in together, wherever that is, I can finally start looking for a job there.‚Äù\\n\\nI pushed a little, and he expressed that he wasn‚Äôt joking.\\xa0 He was genuinely planning on moving to wherever I get a job in my field to live with me.\\xa0 He said that he loves supporting me and what I do.

It seemed like months of his repressed feelings spilling out in the middle of the store.  I left pretty soon after.\\n\\nDamn my complete lack of social awareness and willingness to believe he'd gotten over it.

       " 'TIFUpdate: Letting my friend watch his wife get hammered on their couch - It has been an interesting day, but I figured it would help me to let out an update on the whole situation involving me getting high while my friend\\'s wife got drunk. In case you missed it, [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1g1sif3/tifu_by_letting_my_friend_watch_his_wife_get/) is the original post.\\n\\nI spoke to Fiona, my wife, about the whole situation, and she agreed with me- though a lot of what happened was no fault of my own, this type of situation shouldn\\'t be repeated. I think what helped is that I emphasized how uncomfortable the whole situation made me feel, and I was as honest as I could be with her (leaving out the worst of it in order to not make things awkward). Fiona realizes that I didn\\'t go in with this scenario in mind, and there wasn\\'t exactly a safe way for me to exit the situation without souring my friendship with Garth and Cheri in some way. Fiona and I made the agreement that if I repeat such an event with Cheri, there\\'s going to be at least one other friend present (whether said third friend is sober, drunk, or tripping, was not specified).\\n\\nI also reached out to Garth, my friend, and apologized for any discomfort I may have caused him, and I told him that I wasn\\'t intending to repeat such an incident again. That I felt like I had disrespected him in his own home. He responded to me along these lines, \"*It\\'s alright, it\\'s not your fault, we are good. I know who\\'s fault it is.*\" Which is a bit cryptic but I decided to leave it at that, because if Garth says we\\'re cool, I don\\'t want to make it uncool by digging any deeper. We have Burning Wheel night this week, so I\\'ll be able to gauge how things are between us at that point.\\n\\nI then contacted Cheri, Garth\\'s wife, just to confirm how she felt about the situation, and to confirm with her that Garth was ok with it. She cheerfully responded, \"Oh, he was a bit grumpy, but that\\'s just because he thinks those movies are super dumb.\" She then casually suggested that next time we do it it should just be the two of us on a night when Garth is going out, \"So that he doesn\\'t get grumpy about the movies,\" and that she wants to hit 5 drinks next time. I then told her that I would prefer to have another person there, and she was like, \"Hmm. Have it your way I guess.\" So I don\\'t know. I\\'m flattered that Cheri wants to spend quality time with me. But I also have no desire to be in a situation where my mind is inebriated and imagining horrifically awkward social vibes, even if those vibes aren\\'t there from anyone else\\'s perspective.\\n\\nTL;DR After my awkward evening where I was high and my friend\\'s wife was drunk, I unpacked everything. My wife and I made agreements that I won\\'t be alone with her again. My friend and I made up even if it was a bit cryptic. My friend\\'s wife seemed unfazed and wanted to repeat the experience, but seemed miffed when I said I\\'d only do it if someone else was there.',\n",

I said no. He then attempted to persuade me by saying that it‚Äôs \"just a kiss\" and that i should \"loosen up\" and stop \"taking life too seriously\" (average teenage boy speech). I repeatedly said no and that im not interested in him like that. He then got a little upset and refuses to get up since he knew i was dependent on him to get out due to the fence situation, this made me very uncomfortable and scared to where i basically begged him to start going as it was getting late and cold.\\n\\nthis is where i fucked up:\\nonce we make it out the window and by the fence, he jumps over first so he can help me down. It‚Äôs important to note that it‚Äôs a metal fence where the metal doesn‚Äôt stick out the same way on both sides, so it was much more difficult to get out than to get in. Once he makes it over, i start climbing up but keep slipping, once im almost finally at the top, my shirt gets caught on a piece of the metal that‚Äôs sticking out on the top and i slip with an almost cartoonish ripping sound, leaving me hanging to the fence by my shirt and bra that are now only around my neck with my whole upper body exposed while this dude just stares from across the fence. i proceed to struggle for a few seconds while this dude STANDS AND LAUGHS until i give up and slip out of my shirt and bra completely, leaving me completely shirtless in a german FALL at night, while he just stands on the opposite side of the fence staring and kind of laughing. I eventually make it over the fence, still shirtless, and he gives me his jacket.

I wanted more specific advice as I've been confused about how to handle this situation so here goes..\\n\\nI dated my partner for 8 months. We had a break after 3 months as I struggled to maintain the relationship after frequent break up conversations. Our communication improved when we got back together but I felt numb and strange a couple months into being together again.

I had definitely been neglecting my self-care and my own friends and family. I thought my issues with anxiety and deperssion were also affecting how I felt in the relationship.\\n\\nDue to the nature of our break up and neither side wanting it to end, we have remained friends and continued to nurture a relationship with one another. We went a week where we weren't speaking very much and it felt horrible. After that, we bumped into each other, had an awkward encounter then agreed to spend time together to see if it was a relationship worth continuing. Then we slept together.\\n\\nAfter a lot of talks, we have agreed that we want to stay close while letting each other explore our personal roads to peace and contentment, whatever form this takes.

       " 'TIFU by letting my friend watch his wife get hammered on their couch - \\\\[*Trigger Warning - Alcohol and Drug use*\\\\] Alright so this whole ordeal just took place over the past several hours, and I\\'m still reeling. I\\'m writing this out to try to help me process what the fuck happened.\\n\\nFor some context- I (29M) am married. My friends relevant to this situation, Garth (29M) and Cheri (24F), are married to each other. Garth and I are good friends and we play Burning Wheel and other such TTRPGs together with a group of guys. Cheri and I are also quite close and we share a lot of similar interests. We\\'re both creative, like art and gaming, etc, there\\'s just a lot that makes us click in ways that Garth and I don\\'t. And that\\'s fine. We\\'re all friends and it seems to be all good.\\n\\nOne day Cheri and I were messaging as we often do, and she suggested a \"fun night idea\" to me, namely, that she gets drunk and I trip out on mushrooms, and we do it together while watching a few dumb movies. In and of itself, that sounded hilarious and I thought it would be pretty fun. I\\'m not a drinker, I had never even been around someone who had been drunk before. Cheri likes her drinks but had only seen me dose mushrooms once before on a very low dose. I guess she was curious about us being together while under the influence, and I can\\'t deny that I felt an inexplicable desire to investigate such an experience as well. So it seemed like a good plan and we made the arrangements.\\n\\nI decided to be honest with my wife, Fiona, about our plans. She was hesitant at first. There\\'s been awkward moments between the four of us as couples before (although lines were never truly crossed), so I don\\'t blame her. But after I made it clear that Garth would be there, she was ok with it and told me simply to tell her how it went afterward. Well, let\\'s start by saying, \"*it went.*\" **Cue a long string of awkward fuckups that would last the entire evening.**\\n\\nThe first fuckup was that when I showed up, Garth wasn\\'t home. It was only me and Cheri. She\\'d just put her kids to bed 30min before, and Garth was working late apparently. Which felt a little bit awkward, being alone with her, but I shrugged it off since she seemed so innocuous and nonchalant about it. I took my mushrooms and she had her first drink of the evening, and we put on a movie of her choosing which we had both agreed would probably be funny and dumb. Cheri had rearranged their living room so that the 2-seater loveseat was facing the TV instead of the normal 3-seater couch. I don\\'t know if she did it just for that day or if it had been like that all week, since the last time I had been there they\\'d had the 3-seater couch across from the TV and the loveseat off to one side. This meant that we were sitting closer together. As the shrooms kicked in, every time she\\'d speak to me and I would turn to her I would see her hair floating up a bit like waves of reddish-orange and her skin was taking on an undeniably attractive hue. These effects are par for the course though so I wasn\\'t concerned about that.\\n\\nI was peaking on the trip by the time she was starting her third drink. I don\\'t know alcohol because I don\\'t drink, and in my current state I was unable to discern whether she was playing up the alcohol or if she is just a lightweight. She kept giggling and laughing, leaning on me and touching me a lot. Meanwhile I was really struggling to \\'zen\\' through this; it was like I realized there was a disconnect between our sources of inebriation. Cheri asked me to feel her hair because she saw I was staring at it and I had explained to her what it looked like visually. It felt really soft and nice. My serotonin receptors were going off like mad and in my mind, it felt like I had never seen a more beautiful and lovely person in my life. I told Cheri this, and it made her laugh uproariously and pretty much fall on top of me from laughter. She remained physically close and leaning against me for a while, and in my psychological state it felt like her body was melting into mine.\\n\\nGarth came home just as Cheri had cracked open her fourth drink. She happily got up and kissed him at the door. I said Hello, and he acknowledged me and went straight to the shower. I\\'m not sure how long he was in there, but the time dilation made it feel so long that I had completely forgotten he was even in the house by the time he came out. It was just me and Cheri being silly and watching a dumb movie. When Garth came out, he sat on the 3-seater couch by himself and was eating a meal Cheri had made earlier. He then made some kind of complaint about the meal, which she dismissed nonchalantly, and it was at that very moment that I started feeling awkward. Suddenly, I couldn\\'t shake this idea that it was like he was watching me have a date with his wife, and going farther, right in front of him. Cheri didn\\'t change her physical behavior much, despite his presence, except to stop leaning against me as profusely she had been. She also mentioned, right in front of Garth, that this was \"the drunkest she had been in a long time.\"\\n\\nFrom my time-dilated perspective, it felt like YEARS for Cheri to finish her fourth drink. And the whole time, Garth sat off to the side, on his phone. In my mental state, I couldn\\'t stop thinking that he was *furious* at us. Cheri tried to involve him in conversation several times but he kind of ignored her, and I think the only thing I directly recall him saying was, \"This movie is the stupidest shit ever.\" Eventually Garth left the room for the evening and I didn\\'t see him again. Cheri continued her drunken shenanigans and a lot of physical contact. As I was coming down from the trip she started eating a lot of pretzels and drinking a lot of water, which she explained to me was to make sure she wouldn\\'t be so hung over the next day.\\n\\nWe spent about half an hour in deeper conversation after we were both done our respective substances. Cheri seemed completely happy with the whole experience and I couldn\\'t sense any awkwardness from her. She happily talked about how we can do it next time, and agreed that she\\'d pound a drink back shortly before I arrived so that we\\'d be synchronized at our respective \"intoxication\" points. But I felt awkward as FUCK. I left their house feeling like I\\'d had emotional &amp; psychological sex with my friend\\'s wife right in front of him. I told Fiona when I got home that I had to \"process\" the whole experience before I could articulate to her what it was like. She\\'s curious but not overly concerned, but I\\'m not sure how she\\'ll feel after I explain what happened. And now here I am, trying myself to process what actually happened, where things went wrong, and how the fuck I\\'m going to share all this with Fiona (or which parts I omit).\\n\\nTL;DR I hung out with my friend\\'s wife and watched a movie while we were drunk and high, and it was awkward as shit and I felt like I was cheating right in front of my friend.',\n",

We had an insane amount of similarities, including an obsession with true crime podcasts, serial killers, etc. One difference we did have was horror flicks. She told me she gets scared easily.

I was really starting to doubt this route, and as I looked in the rearview, I saw she was following from further behind. At this point, I figured it was best for me to call her and tell her I think Google maps was jerking me around, so I pulled over on the side of the road, looked more closely at maps, and decided to call her, as she was stopped about a half block behind me. As the phone rang, I saw her flip the car around and speed off on the opposite direction. She never answered, and after letting the whole thing sink in, I drove home, opened my dating app to see she also blocked me. \\n\\nThen it dawned on me that I am an absolute idiot, and that talking about my favorite serial killers with a woman who is easily spooked, then leading her to the middle of nowhere was probably just about the worst first date idea ever. I'm bummed, and I feel awful for scaring the shit out of her, but I guess I just have to laugh it off at this point, I don't think I'll be hearing from her again. \\n\\nNext time I'll just go to a damned coffee shop like a NOT serial killer\\n\\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nDidn't think a first date idea through very well; convinced a really rad chick that I was probably a murderer\",\n",

       " \"TIFU by almost crushing someone's leg with my car - Ok so this happened about two hours ago and I don't have anyone to talk about it so I decided to post here. English is not my fist language and I am still shaking from what happened so I apologise for any mistakes.\\n\\nI (20m) got my driver's license about 5 months ago but since I don't own a car I almost never used it. I would occasionally take my dad's car to drive very short distances but that was it. However, I still felt pretty confident until today. I had already noticed a problem in the car where, if it is on a slope facing down and I put it on reverse, it will still move forwards when I take my foot out of the brake pedal, which means I have to quickly press on the accelerator for it to go backwards and stop moving forwards. However since it only happened one time I thought maybe it wasn't that big of an issue specially because I never used the car (BIG mistake). Today my dad told me to park the car inside of the garage because it was parked in front of my house, which is on a slope, and there was a delivery van parked right in front of it. So I got in the car, and turned it on, except it didn't turn on, only the panel lit up, not the engine. As I said, since I don't usually use the car, this hadn't happened a lot of times before, and most importantly not on a slope. Then, the guy who was doing the deliveries with the van told me to back up, I was already going to so I proceded with him in front of the car. As soon as I took the car out of parking mode and on reverse, it started to move forwards, but when I pressed on the accelerator for it to go backwards, the car continued to move forwards. I quickly slammed the brakes but since the engine was off the brake pedals were really stiff and didn't make the car stop fast enough to avoid hitting the poor dude. His leg got stuck between his van and mine, and he was yelling for me to reverse because my car was still pressing against his leg. I swear to god, I was trying my hardest but I was so scared and desperate that I couldn't even process what was happening. Since the engine was off the only way to get the car to go backwards was to turn it on, but I was to scared that I couldn't even understand what was the isse. It got to a point where I left my car and went to his side and started to try and push it up the slope to free his leg (I know this is stupid as fuck but I had never been this desperate in my entire life). By a miracle some guy passing by the street saw what was happening, got in my car and was able to turn it on and reverse it. When his leg finally became unstuck, I immediately collapsed to the ground shaking. I kept apologizing to the guy and he was surprisingly chill about all of it. I thought his leg would have at least broken but he was able to stand and walk, he just said it was hurting like a mf. I offered to take him to the hospital a million times but he said it was fine. I gave him my number so that I can pay for his medical expenses but it still didn't feel like enough, idk I was expecting him to freak out on me (which would have been 100% understandable) but he accepted my apologies imediately. I didn't even know how to feel. I am feeling guilty as fuck and, to be honest, I fully deserve it. Imagine if there was a kid in front of the car, I'm shaking just by imagining that. I guess I won't be driving for a long time. \\n\\nTL;DR: I (20M) rarely drive and had an accident today while trying to reverse my dad's car on a slope. The engine was off, causing the brakes to stiffen, and the car moved forward, trapping a delivery man's leg between my car and his van. Thankfully, a passerby helped turn the car on to reverse, and the delivery man wasn‚Äôt seriously injured, but I feel extremely guilty and won‚Äôt be driving for a while.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"TIFU by taking Muscle Relaxants before my UPS shift - TL;DR - started new job a little under a month, took muscle relaxants before work, my body started feeling weird, remembered I took muscle relaxants before work, embarrassed while telling my manager, sent me home for the day, afraid I might lose my job.\\n\\na little under a month ago I started a job at UPS here in my hometown, it hasn't been an easy job by any means, a lot of heavy lifting and a consistent workout while working there, but even then I've loved it so far! The problem started this morning, my mom had left some muscle relaxants in my room for anytime I felt sore from work, after working for a while I had gotten used to the burn of the job, but for whatever reason I decided to take the muscle relaxants before work.\\n\\nWhen I got to work I started stacking boxes and doing the usual work you'd imagine UPS workers do (I guarantee you it's exactly what you think it is except with boxes that are between 20-100lb), until I started feeling the strength in my arms weakening, my legs were aching and my lower back would start feeling like it was squeezing together, it was a weird feeling. For a bit I tried powering through it assuming it was just me needing to fix my posture while I lift and using my legs more, but the feeling was growing more and more, then I remembered taking the muscle relaxants and realizing that my body was relaxing itself while I worked out.\\n\\nTo confirm my suspicions, I looked it up really quick on my phone and unfortunately, my mistake could've risked an injury and caused me to pull something a lot easier than usual. Embarrassed, I looked for a manager to tell them about my mistake, then they asked me a few questions to confirm that I wasn't BSing them until they decided that i should go home. Naturally, I would be okay with going home, but I felt so stupid having to leave my job not even 30 minutes before it even started because of my lack of knowledge on the appropriate time to take muscle relaxants. \\n\\nThe only reason I felt like sharing this in this subreddit is because I'm afraid of losing this job that I frankly fell in love with because of a stupid slip up, I also think I have a greater chance of getting fired because I'm still in the probation stage of my job, not that this has happened before, but I think this might be plenty of reason to let me go. At the same time, I didn't want to risk an injury and make myself a liability to them because of this. Regardless, I lost my hours for the day, and I feel like a complete idiot...\",\n",

Next I tried using needle nose pliers. That did not work. Finally, I tried using a pair of tweezers.

I had planned on flying my drone to get a good view of the damage around my neighborhood. I tried to open my DJl app but the app needed to update. I let the update begin but my cell signal was really weak and was taking forever to update. I decided to get in my truck and look for a stronger signal.\\nI pulled into a Circle K gas station down the street where the signal was strong. It was completely closed no vehicles on the property.. the 20+ pump guns were zip-tied and the store was empty. I decided to get out of the sun and pull under the awnings where the pumps were. I pulled almost in the middle of the pumps as to not seem like l'm pumping gas.\\nAs I sat I began the update and got on the net. Within the first few minutes a couple vehicles pulled up. I didn't bother saying anything as they would quickly find out the place was closed. To my amazement as others driving saw a couple vehicles at the pumps they ALL just started driving in. Before I knew it there were city vehicles, landscape companies and people of all sorts coming to get gas. There were lines of people waiting at each pump. People pulling up to go into the store. At the peak there had to have been 50-60 vehicles on the property. It was way beyond my control. Everyone was confused. It was insane.

       " 'TIFU by telling my friend about my dream - So a couple of weeks ago I had this weird dream, which was mostly normal, except that it was a sort of sex dream(?) I had about a childhood friend. Idk if it counts as that, I didn‚Äôt dream about actually having sex with him but rather I knew that we had in both dreams(I had two different dreams months apart). The first time I thought I could like him because at the time one of my friends had mentioned that he(the friend the dream was about) was basically my ideal type. I explained to her that while he did seem that way on the surface I had never thought of him in such a way in all the years I‚Äôve known him, and that I guess I wasn‚Äôt as superficial as others think I am since the main reason I never thought of him that way is his personality. I can put up with it and find it funny as a friend, but it‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt get over. I also grew up with him(sort of) so I never found him attractive or anything.\\n\\nBasically the first dream I had could be explained by me thinking I could like him after one of my friends mentioned he was my type and him being nicer to me at the time, though that could also be due to us just starting to hang out more then. Like a few days after that dream i remembered why I could never like him in a more than friends way. I think this recent dream was caused by one of our mutual friends liking him and talking about it while trying not to make it too obvious. I think it was because she kept saying things like ‚Äúhe‚Äôs actually so nice, caring, etc.‚Äù  anyways I told him about the dream, which I now realize was a mistake, and then we had a longer talk about dating(not each other just the topic) and about the guy I like and the type of people he would date and why. I specifically mentioned the guy I like because I wanted to make it clear to him that I don‚Äôt like him. He has known that I‚Äôve liked that guy on and off for the past 4 years, so it‚Äôs not a surprise. \\n\\nAnyway, the reason I think he may think I like him is that he jokingly(?) asked if any protection was used and i then told him there was(that‚Äôs literally how I know what happened, like in the first dream he had one for some reason and in the second dream he was going to buy some and I was supposed to look for a hiding place from the others who were there with us). I also then told him that if it made him feel better, I didn‚Äôt actually remember us having sex, and I just knew it happened and he said in his sort of usual awkwardly sarcastic(?) tone ‚Äújust stop it.‚Äù He then went on to ask if I knew about the mutual friend who liked him and I told him I did, which he followed up by saying he had a gut feeling as to her liking him and also what my dream was about but that he wished he was wrong both times, which is what led to the longer deeper conversation we had about dating in general. When I have seen him, things seem normal from an outside perspective, but I think that he thinks I could/do like him. \\n\\nTL;DR:\\nI had two weird dreams months apart about me dating a friend  and I told him about the dreams after I had the second dream a couple of days or weeks ago. Unfortunately, one of our mutual friends had just confessed to him, so we ended up having a longer deeper talk about dating in general, and I mentioned the guy I like to reassure my friend that I don‚Äôt have feelings towards him because I like someone already, but I think I messed things up between us by even mentioning the dreams and that he now thinks I like him.

       " 'TIFU by chewing the wrong brand of gum during a hook up. - Hi Reddit, I\\'m going to do my best to not make this sound like a gum advertisement or a sex novel hahah.  I\\'ve recently told this story to a friend who thought it was so funny and said I should write it down somewhere.  So obviously I thought Reddit would be perfect, I\\'m trying to start posting some of my crazy life stories on here.\\n\\nSo first I need to give some background about myself and my relationship with gum.  I (M28) have chronic tonsil stones.  For anyone who doesn\\'t know, a tonsil stone is a little white ball that forms if a food particle gets stuck in your tonsils, and they smell like there\\'s a rotten animal in the back of your throat.  I still remember coughing up my first one in elementary school music class and not knowing what it was, but I *still* remember it, and the smell.   Now that I am aware of this issue, I\\'m very self conscious about my breath and *always* have gum in my mouth.  I even got doctor notes to be able to chew gum where it\\'s not allowed (like the school bus ect).  I\\'ve considered getting my tonsils removed but would rather not have a surgery for something that can be fixed with chewing gum.\\n\\nOver the years, I have become a gum expert.  I know which brands smell the best and last the longest, and have come to discover the best gum for me.  I\\'m not sponsored, but I will say that my ideal flavor is Spearmint from a brand that has an space related name.  Now I ONLY chew this brand of gum because it lasts pretty long, and I\\'ve experienced other gums that either denigrate into almost a wet tissue type texture that has to be spit out immediately, and other brands that break up into tiny pieces after a certain amount of time.\\n\\nOne last detail is that although I *always* have this gum in my mouth, I don\\'t chew it much, and it\\'s usually just between my molars and cheek.  People have even pointed out that they can\\'t tell I have gum in my mouth because I never actively chew it.  I\\'m also a gymnast and even do backflips with it in my mouth.\\n\\nSo now that you all think I\\'m that girl from Willy Wonka with the chewing gum, here\\'s my fun TIFU story.  About 6 or 7 years ago I was visiting my college town and at the bar.  I sat next to a really handsome guy with a nice smile that I later learned was in the military.  I struck up a convo with him and he was telling me about how he was wearing his hat backwards to attract girls because douchey guys wear their hats backwards and girls like douchebags.  Then he pointed at one of my old college acquaintances walking out with a girl wearing his hat backwards, and said see?  I confirmed I actually knew that guy and he is a douche, he made fun of me for my hobby of insect photography.  Weird conversation but I entertained it because he was hot and maybe I had a chance?  I don\\'t remember what else we spoke about that night, but that always stuck out to me lol.\\n\\nAt the end of the night he invited me back to his place which I thought was odd, because I thought he was straight.  At first I declined and said I\\'m staying with a friend less than a block away but he insisted so again I thought maybe I have a chance with this guy.  I shared my location with the friend I was staying with and while we were driving back to his place, he told me about how he was curious so I was like \"so you will cuddle with me tonight???\"  And he said \"probably more ;)\"\\n\\nWhen we got back to his place he showered since he had been at some sort of military training for a few days, and then came back to the bedroom to hook up.  I asked him if he had gum (of course the one time I left the house without it), partially to clean the taste of White Gummy Bear Drinks from my mouth and partially because I recently heard somewhere that BJs feel better with minty gum and he handed me a brand that was not the Space Gum brand I like.  I immediately recognized that, but beggars can\\'t be choosers right?\\n\\nNow for the NSFW part.  We started hooking up and without being too vulgar, I made my with my mouth down from his neck to his chest to his beautiful abs to his dick.  After we finished hooking up, he turned the light on, looked in the mirror and said \"DUDE! WHAT THE FUCK!\"\\n\\nWell apparently it was one of those brands that breaks up into tiny pieces in my mouth, and he had little tiny pieces of gum stuck to his body hair.  He was blonde so he didn\\'t have a lot of body hair, and I think he might have shaven too but it was so embarrassing to help him pick all these little pieces of gum off of him lol.\\n\\nOther than that, it was a pretty good hook up and we stayed in touch and hooked up again but I\\'m not in to long distance relationships and he was still more interested in women.\\n\\nTL;DR I hooked up with a hot guy from the bar and my gum got stuck to his body hair.',\n",
       " 'TIFU by installing Linux at work - So, I was just recently hired by an HR company to do some IT/Marketing stuff, and I was pretty happy about it at first.\\n\\nHowever, today I encountered a problem I may have overstepped some boundaries when trying to solve the problem.\\n\\nThe person at the front desk had some performance as well as hardware issues with their old Windows 7 machine and asked me to solve it. Once near the PC I tried unplugging and plugging the Ethernet cable, which blue-screened the PC. So, I thought to myself \"oh, just reinstall the network driver, easy peasy\". But then, when I uninstalled the driver, I rebooted the machine in order to check if it was completely gone, but by doing that I locked myself out of the PC.\\n\\nThis lock-thing happened because the account the lady was using was being stored on the server-side, not locally, which meant if I wanted to login to the PC I would need the username and password of the local account, which nobody, not even the IT company hired to do most of the computer stuff knew about. Without option, and since the lady needed the telephony app workig ASAP, I impulsively installed a Linux partition and tried emulating the software on Wine without asking for permission first.\\n\\nFor anyone knowledgeable about IT and Linux, this isn\\'t much of a problem to fix if they do not desire the Linux OS anymore, but to the lady that was using the PC she probably thought I \"destroyed\" or permanently modified it beyond repair. The Windows 7 is still sitting there but like I said, you can\\'t do jack squat without local admin username and password, and the company hired to do the IT part doesn\\'t know or doesn\\'t want to share this information. It also doesn\\'t help that she has a very deep and intimidating voice. I am still anxious (heart-racing) and afraid of what will happen.\\n\\nI was hired to do fix anything IT related and I did not want to appear incompetent and now I\\'m probably more screwed than ever. I really hope they see it the other way, because it would be embarrassing to be fired in just a short time.\\n\\nTL;DR, I tried using Linux as a workaround tool without permission at work because the PC would not work/logon.',\n",

My boyfriend used to live in that flat some years ago while he was at university, so we‚Äôve both spent a lot of time there. The flat is on the second floor with a view of a neighborhood courtyard where a community of stray cats lives. Whenever we used to cook, we would always look out the kitchen window to watch the cats.\\n\\nCut to midday today: I was making pasta for lunch when my boyfriend looked out the window. The blinds were halfway up, so while I, being 5\\'1\", could see a teenage girl in a school uniform walking through the courtyard, my 6\\'2\" boyfriend couldn‚Äôt. He did, however, spot an old calico cat sitting right below our window that he recognized.

I move closer and notice that the bowls are balanced slighty on the bench - even better - it's a fun bench you can wobble the seats on! At this point, I reach out to wobble a seat...

By the time the payment finally went through, my toddler, who‚Äôd been holding it together pretty well up until that point in a long day, was having a full on meltdown, loud screaming, kicking, crying.\\n\\nI decide that the easiest fastest way to unload, given the circumstances, would be to pick her up in her car seat (which my back really can‚Äôt handle) and run her across the street while the light was red (like jaywalk it when there are no cars coming), then set her down and do the same for our stuff. \\n\\nSo I set down my screaming crying toddler in her car seat on the sidewalk, yell across the street for the driver to please open the trunk. When he opens it, I leave her on the sidewalk, run and grab our bags. The driver brings over the stroller (a gb pockit‚Äînot like a huge stroller). I thank him.\\n\\nThe sidewalk on our side is a wide one. We live next door to a restaurant that has outdoor dining. I pick up the little one in her car seat, run her over to the building, set her down screaming and crying bloody murder in her car seat in front of the door to our building while I run back to grab our stuff to bring it over.\\n\\nThe screaming and crying has, of course, gotten the attention of the people dining at the restaurant, who are now looking over aghast at my child: it‚Äôs nighttime, and the sidewalk is wide enough and the distance to the luggage and the stroller is far enough that they don‚Äôt immediately see me / make the connection that I‚Äôm with her. Everyone is looking in shock at this crying baby who looks like she‚Äôs been abandoned all by herself in front of a building.\\n\\nI run over to the building, struggling, schlepping all of our stuff. I‚Äôm still a bit salty from the cost of the ride being so much higher than I‚Äôd budgeted for,  and I‚Äôm feeling like I owe the restaurant customers an explanation, so, as I‚Äôm hauling our stuff over, I yell over to them, ‚ÄúI tipped the cab driver like $50, and he didn‚Äôt even help me!‚Äù\\n\\nI thought he had already driven away. \\nHe had not. \\nHe was right in front of the restaurant with his car windows down. \\n\\nI‚Äôm not sure if he fully heard me or only partly heard me or if he didn‚Äôt hear me but maybe just caught the gist of the situation. But he probably heard me.  I saw his face in that moment, and I felt terrible.\\n\\nIt, of course, wasn‚Äôt his fault that both of the usual unloading spots on my side of the street were taken. It wasn‚Äôt his fault that he‚Äôd had open heart surgery and probably couldn‚Äôt help me carry my things. It wasn‚Äôt his fault that my toddler was having a meltdown or that I‚Äôd gotten his hopes up by misspeaking about an over-large tip (that was already a lot) or that my card got declined at first.\\n\\nI feel so terrible. I wish I could find him and apologize or make it up to him.\\n\\nTL;DR: A super nice old cab driver heard me loudly complaining that he didn‚Äôt help me; I feel like shiit.',\n",

       " 'TIFU Having An Altercation With My Sister - Even though this altercation happened 5 years ago, it still felt like today because it is directly impacting my daily life due to the fact my sis still lives in the same city as me and is adamant in not moving out.\\n\\nI (23M) was born in Asia, immigrated to the US in 2012,  and studied at an elite private high school for 6 years before attending a T20 university in 2018 where I was later conferred an SB in EECS. I am currently a US Citizen and live in a studio apartment in an affluent neighbourhood of which I pay $1650/month for. I am currently engaged in post graduate research to prepare for my PhD in a few years, and make money as a software consultant, freelance mobile app developer, part-time tech YouTuber, and part-time investor.\\n\\nI have positive relations with my paternal family (most of his US-bound relatives immigrated to the US with H1B visas and reside in NJ, VA, CA). However, I have ambivalent (mostly negative) relations with my maternal family of which all of her US-bound relatives live in the same state an hour away from me.\\n\\nDue to the fact my paternal relatives are affluent/influential, and communists, they are being perceived as the \\'black sheep\\' and \\'scapegoats\\' in my mother\\'s family. My maternal relatives also espouse traditionalistic views and are apathetic towards elite institutions. For example, they heavily practise filial piety and hair dye/tattoos are off limits in the family.\\n\\nMy parents (74M, 63F) still live in Asia and even though both are retired, they were former mid to high ranking dignitaries in Asia and have millions in assets.\\n\\nDuring high school, my unweighted GPA was very close to 4.0 (my weighted GPA was much higher given the fact I took many AP courses as well as post-AP courses such as Multivariable Calculus/Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Discrete Maths, CS 2, etc) and I received a 1550 on the SAT (800M, 750V) as well as an 800 on two SAT subject tests (Math II, Physics). I even competed in the USAMO and ISEF and had two CS internships in Summer of 2017 and 2018.\\n\\nEven though I have achieved a lot during my childhood years and adolescence and was contemplating about starting a tech startup, my mother\\'s side showed more affection towards my sister (23F) who dreamt of becoming a general practitioner and went to a university with a &gt;80% acceptance rate (in the same city as me as my parents attended her commencement and I drove my parents there) They gave her more warmth, they talked in a nicer and more friendly tone towards her, and they even praised her, whilst my achievements were mostly ignored and instead, I was castigated during family gatherings and at worse, even ostracised. My older cousins sometimes even engaged in corporal punishment if I didn\\'t socialise with the whole family and I am obviously weak at social skills myself. That made me feel jealous because even though my father and mother helped fund for my schooling, they as well as the whole of the mother\\'s side collectively funded her lifestyle and gave her perks and affection. In fact, in 2014, during 9th grade, my maternal relatives attempted to tell my parents to withhold my tuition money and send me to a worse private school and siphon that money towards her so she could get freebies as well as attend some school like Philips Andover whilst also buying a condo/single house for her due to her \\'respecting the family more\\' and \\'knowing how to speak their language\\'.\\n\\nWe attended the same high school and we lived with our older sister (34F) in a 2000 sqft house.\\n\\nIn 2019, things did take a turn for the worse. I was still under 18 in summer of 2019 so I couldn\\'t invest the money nor have a bank account of my own, but needless to say, I bought a safe to stockpile all the money I earned through internships, YouTube revenue, and mobile app revenue at the time, so my bank would typically have amounts in the low thousands for immediate purchases. Needless to say, in July 2019, due to the fact my 34F sister is still in charge of my bank account, I saw that my balance went down from $6000 to $1000. I essentially lost $5000 of my own money and guess what:\\n\\nAll of the money went to my 23F sister.\\n\\nIn August, I found out the whole family pooled in money and used my money to buy her a $700k condo in the poshest neighbourhood (even moreso than mine which is a college neighbourhood) and they also bought her a brand new 2019 BMW 330xi as well as pooled in money for her EB5 visa.\\n\\nDue to this, I became jealous at her. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t have a therapist at the time, so I ended up so infuriated I essentially had a vocal altercation with her on the phone that went a little bit too far that my sister decided that she will go NC against me and \\'lost her trust\\' on me. In retaliation, I went NC with everyone in my family, except my parents because I kinda rely on them for financial support as I just started to make in the mid 5 figures per year on my software. In September 2019, I started my own bank account, sold the safe, and stockpiled my money into the bank, where I funneled in all of it towards investments. By 2021, I sacked them and was 100% self reliant, and frugal (that meant I didn\\'t move to any luxe-apartments nor did I buy any car and instead used a $250 Walmart bike to commute).\\n\\nEven though everything was harmonious between 2019-20 with me coexisting with her in the same city, things started to go out of control in 2020 that made my undergraduate GPA plummet, from a 4.8 in 2018-19 to a 4.6 in 2020 (remote year), and then to a 4.0 in 2021 (first in person year).\\n\\nTurns out, even though I have no idea of my sisters whereabouts whether she is in Asia or in the US as it was COVID, turns out police knocked on my apartment door and gave me a warning that my sister reported me to them for \"stalking\" at her college (had no idea where she studied and I was minding my own business and did not go to her college). That was what caused a heated altercation with my relatives. I told my relatives to calm my sister down, apologise for my supposed \\'wrongdoing\\' and asked them to let her know I did nothing wrong and that I was minding my own business.\\n\\nIn 2020, she travelled to Asia and my parents sold that condo in September 2020, so I had no idea where she lived as my parents own multiple multi-family and single family units throughout the metropolitan area.\\n\\nThat made me paranoid, wanting to transfer out to another university in another state but feared upon losing my place at a top tier university, and it caused me to have trauma and sleepless nights and disinterest in studying which was what caused my GPA to plummet. It is so fascinating that my mother\\'s family who obviously support her tell me they have nothing to do with her and they can\\'t control her life and they just essentially let her free roam like this, which was what harmed my life. They even gaslit me, making claims that she is \\'stubborn\\', \\'a tough girl\\', etc, and that she won\\'t listen because she came from wealthy family, and spread misinformation that children of impoverished parents are better behaved and more compassionate.\\n\\nI know my sister very well as we were classmates at high school and she is known to volunteer and help other people out, mentor, and offer therapy/counseling to marginalised/neurodivergent people, even if her grades/SATs weren\\'t as stellar as mine and she took less AP courses than me.\\n\\nIn 2021, I essentially returned to campus so depressed that I essentially lacked any support as I had no therapists or psychiatrists, and my GPA plummeted big time. Even though I had an internship, a research fellowship, led a campus club, and held awards, etc, during 1st and 2nd year, I was heavily demotivated in the 2021-2 school year and all I wanted to do was graduate. After graduating, I took a small 1 week Europe trip to Berlin, Warsaw, Vienna, Bratislava, and Prague, and went back to just a deep several month rest. I did eventually get hold of a therapist and actually got a relatives RAV4 in the beginning of 2023 whilst they buy a Tesla Model Y for themselves and just driven around the East Coast for some relaxation.\\n\\nBetween 2019 and mid-2023 when my sister graduated from university and my parents visited US for the first time since COVID, I had no contact with her whatsoever. I didn\\'t have any idea what neighbourhood or town she lived between 2020 and 2023, let alone the house. Now even though May 2023 was the only time since 2019 when I did talk to her, apologising to her for the 2019 incident, establishing boundaries, and ameliorating the relationship, she claimed she is traumatised by my actions, had sleepless nights, and had to resort to therapist. She ended up using profanity in front of me as well.\\n\\nLater, one of my cousins told me that my sister was featured on the student spotlight on the front page of the school, despite the fact my family gaslighted me telling me she is a low achiever and struggled in college. I also found out on YouTube watching her school graduation that she graduated summa cum laude (3.9/4.0) and held an internship in Healthcare and now is hired full time in that position. I was immensely betrayed. It\\'s so baffling my family let my GPA slide whilst my sister essentially got full support even from extended family and is uplifted. She even benefited off my money and my work. Her school even praised her for being extremely involved in the school and mentions nothing about trauma whatsoever.\\n\\nAfterwards, I started to use my mobile revenue and investment portfolio to live off it, joined a post-undergrad research fellowship at my university in summer 2023 after returning home from yet another trip in Europe for escapism as well as start Doordashing for some fresh air outside and extra money for petrol/electric as well as to clear my brain, and all went well. Despite that, I might have bumped into her neighbourhood several times as I visited every neighourhood in the city as well as nearby suburbs through Doordash. My sister and family have been campaigning for me to leave the metro area which might result in me losing my network as well as support for my tech startup as my city is one of the top cities for tech in the US.\\n\\nTL;DR: 5 years ago, there was an incident that caused me (23M) to be estranged from my family and upended my life, and even though I went NC with large swaths of my family, my sister still accused me of \\'calling her\\' despite not knowing her number, and now she and my family are threatening litigation against me, making it hard to ignore. The only thing I wanted to do now is leave this state entirely to totally forget about this family but then I would have to restart my social network from scratch if I were to move to let\\'s say, California.\\n\\nSis, if you are reading this, I truly apologise for the behaviour I did against you back in 2019. I tried my best to fix my behaviour and visit a therapist. I just felt like I had to vent because of this.',\n",

       " \"TIFU Impersonating a teacher through email - So, here‚Äôs the deal. I've been struggling with one of my classes at an unnamed LA school, and my dad‚Äôs been all over me about it.

I was falling behind, and I knew that if my dad found out, it would be the end of the world (or at least it felt that way).\\n\\nCue the dumbest idea I‚Äôve ever had. Instead of being honest and dealing with it like a normal human being, I decided to create a fake email account pretending to be my teacher. I thought I could buy myself some time, maybe come up with a plan to fix my grades while my dad was temporarily satisfied. I even used their picture from the school website and wrote emails in the same formal tone they use.\\n\\nThe first email was pretty innocent, just something about how grades were still being processed and that I was working hard to improve. And‚Ä¶ It worked. My dad completely bought it. He was all, ‚ÄúThanks for the update,‚Äù and for a while, I felt like I‚Äôd gotten away with it.

So, naturally, he contacted the school administration to make sure she was getting his messages. That‚Äôs when the school‚Äôs IT department got involved. It didn‚Äôt take them long to figure out that the ‚ÄúTeacher‚Äù email was fake, and it all blew up in my face.\\n\\nI got a call from the school principal and they laid it all out, how I had impersonated my teacher, how I had been sending fraudulent emails, and how it was a serious breach of trust and school policy.

       " \"TIFU By Accidentally Huffing Gasoline - So, this didn't actually happen today but a few months back.\\n\\nI love to hike and on this occasion took my car to camp in for the entire week.

So of course, I thought it would be okay to keep it in the car with me overnight, right? \\n\\nNo, not right at all. I dozed off and woke up an hour later with a strong smell of gas. At least, I initially thought I had woken up, until I realised THERE WAS A HUGE BLACK SHADOWY CREATURE PERCHED NEXT TO MY HEAD LOOKING OVER ME. \\n\\nNow, this creature was a human ish shape, but with no discernible features. It really was just a dark black shadowy mass, with arms, legs and a head. Weird thing was, even though I could not move, I felt no fear whatsoever. I looked at this thing and felt safety. Almost thinking to myself, oh, thank god you're here. I'm not sure how long we locked eyes (?that's if this thing had any) but I must have dozed off again after a while.\\n\\nI awoke a short while after with the creature still in my car with me, but this time perched like a gargoyle on my dashboard. Again, no fear at all. Pure serenity. \\n\\nNot long after dozing off again, I actually woke up this time and bolted up right. Of course, this time with no creature in the car.

Without noticing, it sat there for three minutes.\\n\\nI only realized my mistake after I finished preparing the yakisoba. By that time, the tofu had turned a dark shade of brown, soaking up the tea as it rehydrated. I figured it was no big deal and tossed the tofu into the yakisoba. Well, I was wrong. It turns out the tofu had absorbed more than just the water. It also soaked up the flavor of the tea. Combined with its own flavor, it created something terrible.

       " 'TIFU by telling my students that I like to flip it over and hit it from the back - For context, most of my students are seniors in HS. We\\'re working on a project that involves cnc milling out words and then laser engraving and laser cutting acrylic letters that are press-fitted into the wood. The acrylic pieces are the exact same size as the carved out letters so you need some pressure to get them in. We use a rubber mallet to hit the letters, but if students aren\\'t careful, they can crack the acrylic. When I make personal projects like this, I push the letters in enough for them to be stuck, then I flip the board over with the letters face down on the table and then use the mallet to hit the back of the board. This causes the acrylic letters to be pushed against the table and into their carved out spots in the board. Well, while busy taking care of 1000 things around the lab at once, I quickly told some students who were mid-process on pressing their letters in that \"I like to flip it over and hit it from the back.\" I quickly realized what I said and walked into another part of the lab hoping that no one heard it that way. Then I glanced over to the students and they were laughing pretty hard. I walked back over and said \"Yep, I heard it too.\" They\\'re good kids and knew it was an honest mistake, but yeah...\\n\\nTL;DR: I told my students \"I like to flip it over and hit it from the back.\" when describing a helpful tip on pressing acrylic inlays into cnc\\'d wood.

I‚Äôm basically the only person in the group that‚Äôs getting into any kind of fights or arguments over this. I only did this because ik out of those in my group I was probably the most patient or non confrontational person if a fight happened. Anyways this has caused my anxiety to be through the roof.

So it‚Äôs Friday we‚Äôre at the game I‚Äôm beyond mad at everything but hiding it and being happy. My gf was getting mad at me at the time which made my mental situation worse and I was just trying to wait for the event to be over. I felt like if anybody tried anything I would have just broke.

I‚Äôve spent 5-6 years getting rid of my anger issues through suppression and patience and it‚Äôs always worked till now. I‚Äôve always been good to ppl patient, empathetic literally everything to try and be likable and I fuck up by letting someone take my phone get to me. I just don‚Äôt know what to do.

       " \"TIFU by accidentally stringing a girl along and getting called out for it - Using my alt account for this one.\\n\\nTL;DR: I didn't realize a girl wanted me to ask her out and by the time I did ask she was checked out. Had to have the FU explained to me.\\n\\nI, 30M, am socially awkward loner that started using dating apps a while ago. I went in having heard horror stories about men not getting matches, so that was the mindset I had. If I got matches, then great; I'd do my best to date them if I thought we were a good fit. But I wasn't expecting much of anything, and that mindset turned out to bite me later.\\n\\nI've gotten a handful of matches over time, but most conversations just died after a few messages. At the time I just always attributed it to women having enough options that I just wasn't interesting.\\n\\nThen came the match I really screwed up on. I matched with a girl in May and we started talking. When talking with someone I generally start with small talk and then escalate to being more flirty if they're interesting. That's what I did here, but this girl took a long time to reply each time (average of 3 days), so it was slow going and I was getting more than a little annoyed after a month had passed and not much had happened. So I decided I was just going to ask her out to do something. I was expecting a yes or no, but instead she expressed confusion that I'd ask her. I just threw up my hands and moved on after that.\\n\\nAt the time I didn't think anything of it, but when I was talking to another guy later (he wanted to complain about his lack of success and I stupidly didn't shut him down immediately), this story came up. I showed him the chat and the dude basically called me an idiot because he pointed out that at the beginning she responded within a day, and only got less and less frequent after my fourth response when she'd responded with a location she liked to hike and I chose to follow-up about a spot I liked. He said I should've followed up on her answer, then asked her out to that spot, especially since she'd flirted twice by that point and I'd ignored it. Since I didn't ask she took it as a sign of little interest, which is why she was confused when I tried later.\\n\\nThe real kicker was when he pointed out she could've ghosted or blocked me anytime, and the fact she didn't proved there was still some interest on her end. Then he called me an asshole for stringing her along for a month and said I did her a favor when I quit talking to her.\\n\\nI felt terrible after that, because what the dude said makes sense. I got so annoyed I never asked myself why she would still be talking to me after a month when most people just immediately ghost if they don't click. It was never my intention to be an asshole, but what's done is done. I'm still matched with her and could technically send her an apology, but I doubt she'd take it as sincere at this point so I don't think it would be worth it when I've already moved on.\",\n",

Even though he ran premade adventures, he would be very flexible and indulge whatever we came up with, as long as it made sense and we didn\\'t push it past his final judgement. The game can be brutal, and we had a couple of newbies, so I took upon myself that I wouldn\\'t let them die. I began to play more tactical, asking questions and digging for details on everything that could be dangerous or exploited for our benefits. This was awesome for me, and the other players complemented me for being a \"good player\". I was really excited about this game, y\\'all. It had been the best experience I\\'ve had playing TTRPGs so far.\\n\\nOk, we had played 3 adventures, one about a minotaur, one about a haunted well and we were halfway through the third dungeon when I made a post on Reddit about how dungeons, in concept, didn\\'t make sense. Since I\\'ve been pondering about every detail, I\\'ve started noticing that, who would have guessed, make believe does not make sense. That minotaur was supposed to be starving like the rest of the maze\\'s denizens. The post was snarky and off-hand, but it was for a bunch of nerds on Reddit, snarky is the secret sauce.\\n\\nThen down came the comments like pouring rain. I sat in my room, reddit on mobile browser, legs swinging all careless, replying strangers and defending my point that when something doesn\\'t make sense, it undermines player agency and makes the game less fun. Only in the next day I\\'ve noticed R had kicked me out of the game group and blocked me in Discord. I checked reddit and lo and behold, he had sent me some private messages at the time i was replying comments. I had even replied to him something along the lines of \"i guess we disagree on our playstyles\" not recognizing his username. I tried explaining to him I wasn\\'t complaining about him or how he runs his game, and that I had had so much fun playing with him I didn\\'t understand we he had cut me off like that, but the (critical) damage has already been done.\\n\\nSo now I\\'m a game orphan and I lost the best game mates I\\'ve ever had :/ R, if you read this, I\\'m truly sorry.\\n\\nTL;DR: I was kicked out of the best ttrpg game I\\'ve ever played because I unknowingly insulted the game master with a snarky reddit post.',\n",

After more discussion, she asked for my phone and promptly entered her proper name and personal phone number into it. This, I know, is basically breaking rule #1 for escorts, which is never reveal your personal details because of the issues over safety. She wanted me to get back in touch with her about a week afterwards, as she was aware I had care of my children for a period of time, and to organise an actual date with her. \\n\\nToday was the end of my time with my kids, so I sent her a message asking her when she was available to meet up. She responded saying her boss had found out that she had given me her personal contact info and was mad at her because he believed in doing so she had lost me as a client (she had already effectively lost me as a client before she did this, as I had made it clear we wouldn't be meeting professionally anymore). She asked if we could delay meeting up and if I would come back to her as a client, which would get the heat from the boss off her, with the intent that once things had cooled down we could see each other without him knowing. \\n\\nThe cynic in me says that there was never any intention to go out, and that this was all just a desire to keep me as a client. But what confuses that for me is her giving me her personal details. Having been a client of this industry for some time now, I know how seriously these ladies guard their personal details, and handing them over for the sake of trying to retain one semi-regular client seems unlikely. I know also there is the possibility that her boss is coercing her to try and do this, eg threatening to stop her working as an escort. \\n\\nThe unfortunate end to the story is despite having convinced myself that there might actually be a genuine connection between us, one that could develop into something more, I've had to made the decision to just walk away. It's left me feeling both depressed at my hopes of finally having met someone being dashed, stupid for tricking myself into believing it in the first place, and angry that if this was a genuine connection, the circumstances of our meeting basically ruined any chances. \\n\\nTL:DR: I managed to convince myself that there was a chance of a genuine relationship with an escort who I had been seeing for a few months, only to be disabused of that delusion today and now I'm depressed and venting at my own stupidity. \",\n",

It stayed like that for 8 hours and now the back of the fridge is frozen. \\n\\nI feel so bad now and of course my parents will think of a punishment for me. I'm scared to even go downstairs now.

       " 'TIFU by going to watch the end of a sunset on a mountain  - Sometimes I‚Äôll go out and drive around or go to this specific area on a mountain to watch the sunset. This is something I‚Äôve done a few times but today I went later than normal since I took my parents out to a movie and made the decision last minute since the start of the sunset was gorgeous \\n\\nI drove 45 minutes out on some backroads until I arrived. This spot is a scenic overlook of the Appalachian mountains and a popular tourist spot but since it was late nobody was there. I was worried about being out at dusk and since I did not have pepper spray or a knife but still wanted to see the sunset I grabbed a bottle of perfume and left my car unlocked \\n\\nThe overlook was about 800-1,000ft from my car and you had to walk along a small winding path to reach it. I made it and nothing was out of the ordinary from the dozens of times I‚Äôve been there over the years so I started taking pictures before deciding to take a random video even though it was getting dark \\n\\nDuring this video I heard some slightly far off barking and the second I heard it and started questioning what it was I heard a barking and howl directly underneath the overlook (the overlook was a small circle porch, anything can get onto it within a matter of seconds). I very quickly realized that I had already been there a good bit between the walk to the overlook and taking the pictures so they likely already knew I was there and had been sneaking up on me. I did not stick around to see them or find out if they really were coyotes\\n\\nAt this point it was completely dark and I was not about to risk the time to turn on a flashlight so I just booked it as best I could to my car and got out of there as quickly as I possibly could. No the perfume was not used I was worried that was gonna fck me over more than I already was\\n\\nTL;DR, I chose to go to a mountain to watch the sunset right at dusk but got hunted by coyotes instead ',\n",
       " 'TIFU by trying to be a considerate brother-in-law and ended up missing an historic victory by the Minnesota Gopher Football team. - My sister-in-law teaches at the University of Minnesota. She teaches a few of the students and got tickets to a Gopher football game against USC, among other game-related festivities throughout the weekend. She and a guest were invited to go. She would have taken my brother (her husband), but he recently had a flare-up of tinnitus that he\\'s been struggling with, and so he didn\\'t want to go to this very loud event. He suggested to his wife that she take me with them instead, and I happily obliged.\\n\\nI should specify, although I did go to all of the Gopher football games when I was a student back in the 2000s, I have not kept up with the team at all since I graduated. I don\\'t give a huge damn about how they do, to be honest. I have really not cared about college sports since finishing college 17 years ago. Gopher football is generally not a very good team and is never expected to win big, though they have randomly been pulling off some big wins here and there lately.\\n\\nAnyway, my sister-in-law is NOT a sports person *at all* and talked repeatedly about how little of a damn she generally gives about any of this. I\\'ve known her for nearly 20 years now and I know she has not ever cared about sports and will never care about them in the future. I do know she\\'s frequently stressed out, especially lately, and I know she went to a hot yoga class which wore her out this morning. She and my brother have two young kids at home, and she\\'s a very good mother who takes great care of them and who prioritizes them above all else. She also flat-out said to me that she wouldn\\'t be mad if we left the game a bit early. As for myself, I just ran in a 10K this morning, and I had to get up at 5:30 AM for it, so I was fine with leaving early also. This game did not start until 6:45 PM in the evening.\\n\\nLong story short, eventually the game reaches the 4th quarter and the Gopher\\'s offense sputters once again, which it has been doing all second half. USC (who, by the way, is ranked 11th in the country) is up by 7 points and gets the ball back, and at that point I decide it\\'s best to give both my sister-and-law and myself what we really want, which is an early exit from this game so we can both go home and get some rest, WITHOUT having to fight traffic. We leave the game.\\n\\nAnd wouldn\\'t you know it, as soon as we leave, Minnesota intercepts the ball, then scores a touchdown, tying the game. They would eventually score yet another touchdown and then intercept the ball with less than a minute left in the game, solidifying their improbable victory. Fans stormed the field in excitement, as this 2-3 and unfavored Gopher football team knocked off one of the best teams in the country.\\n\\nAs we were driving home, her husband was texting her back, saying he was \"appalled\" and \"disappointed\" that we left the game (she read his texts back to me), and she said something to the effect of \"well \\\\*I\\\\* didn\\'t want to leave the game...\" She did agree to leave when I suggested it, in my defense. After I dropped her off, she texted me saying \"they\\'re storming the field!\" I have a strong sense that now she\\'s actually pissed that we left. And I am definitely pissed at myself for missing it. I kinda just want to curl up into a ball and die right now.\\n\\nTL;DR: got tickets to a gopher football game, sister-in-law talked a lot about being tired and how she didn\\'t really want to stick around for the whole game. I obliged and we missed a field-storming victory and I think now SIL is pretty pissed at me also.',\n",

It wasn‚Äôt entirely planned- we were picking up hay for our other animals, and the lady asked if we knew anyone who would be interested as someone had dumped off a box of puppies 6 weeks prior and they were to the point of needing to be rehomed. Needless to say, we fell in love with the runt of the litter and brought him home. \\n\\nHe‚Äôs a very smart boy and picked up the standard commands as well as his recall very quickly- he had proper leash etiquette by 4-5 months, and now is learning more ‚Äútricks‚Äù that he is 10 months old. One of the first things we were able to teach him, due to my partner and I both having some mobility issues, was ‚Äúuppies‚Äù for him to be scooped up and carried. He was around 3 pounds when we got him (at 7/8 weeks old), and all the calculations said he would come out to around 25-30lbs full grown.\\n\\nWe did one of those doggy DNA tests at the five month mark, mostly to make sure there were no breed-specific health concerns we needed to keep an eye out for. He was starting to get some physical features that looked familiar to other dogs I‚Äôd had previously, and we were also placing bets on what his breed composition would be. \\n\\nWell his results came in. 50% staffie, 20% lab, and some other odds and ends mixed in. He went from the 3lb pup to the 60lbs of solid muscle he is today (at 10 months so his growing has slowed down but he‚Äôs still got time to go). He‚Äôs not tall, he‚Äôs not chunky, he‚Äôs very active and has helped us both stay busy. \\n\\nHave you seen those videos of dogs running and jumping at their owners because they still think they‚Äôre tiny?

Today I had two meetings, 1 with my former therapist and it was just a recap of the previous sessions, another evaluation to see where I stand now, and wrapping things up.

This one will be a permanent therapist unlike the previous one. I was texting my friend and she asked me to do her a favor and so I did her the favor and then I told her I would be honest with her. I was referring to finally entrusting her with my secret, so I did the favor, sent her screenshots and then shared my notes with her, it was a suicide note I wrote about a month ago, I then went to the restroom and while I was there I got the call notification on my watch.

My teacher being the gracious man that he is allotted us to stay an additional 10 minutes which I gratefully took full advantage of. After the test I sped walked over to my bike and took off towards my next class. However on my usual route there was some sort of construction going on that blocked off the shortest route. Instead of taking the minute to back track and go the slightly longer way I noticed there was a handicap accessible path just conveniently veering off just on the outside of the fenced off area and opted to go through there instead. Once I got to the top of the handicap ramp I realized that it did not go back down onto the other side of the path and was just a balcony. Instead of doing the logical thing of turning around and cutting my losses I decided to double down and tried dropping my bike over this 4ft ledge.

       " \"TIFU by assuming my Cambodian in-laws and wife like Cambodian cuisine. - Located in the United States, theres generally not many Cambodian restaurants and many that do exist are bundled up with Thai or Vietnamese cuisine. This meant a majority of my experience with my wife and her family was eating at non-Cambodian restaurants. The few times we did go to Cambodian restaurant it was Vietnamese or Thai bundled up. My in-laws don't cook so never had a at-home dinner with them. I'm Asian too and felt bad we never went to their cuisine and assumed they were avoiding Cambodian restaurants out of convenience for others. \\n\\nA few nights ago I decided to surprise my wife and in-laws by bringing them to a authentic full-blown Cambodian restaurant. No Thai or Vietnamese dish. From the start it was awkward because I didn't know Cambodian dishes and I came in expecting them to be excited/happy, and take over in ordering. In reality my in-laws and wife were pretty stoic and pretty much had me order dishes from the menu. After dinner and saying goodbye, I asked if something was wrong with the restaurant I chose, and thats when I found out that her family doesn't like Cambodian food. She assumed I would've realized that since they never went to or chose Cambodian restaurants.  \\n\\nFor the curious, one uniquely Cambodian dish is [fish amok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_amok)\\n\\n\\nTL;DR Cambodian restaurants are not common. Thought it would be a nice gesture to take Cambodian in-laws to Cambodian restaurant. Wife and in-laws were indifferent and it felt like they were going for me.

But we butt heads all the time because we often both want to be right and are desperate to be understood and do not put much effort into being understanding. This obviously means our arguments do not go toooo smoothly, but we know this and we‚Äôre trying to work on it.\\n\\nHe is very strait laced, doesn‚Äôt drink, smoke, go to clubs or bars. I am not like super wild, but I enjoy going out from time to time and love to get tipsy with my friends and have a nice smoke sesh from time to time. \\n\\nWhen we first started dating, he hated that I smoked. Even suggested he would end things with me if I continued to. So I decided to stop smoking because it wasn‚Äôt super important to me, and it obviously was for him and I just didn‚Äôt want to lose him and wanted to avoid the conflict.\\n\\nSince then, we‚Äôve talked about it more where I‚Äôve expressed I only stopped bc he said he‚Äôd end things, and I don‚Äôt want to stop doing something I enjoy just because he has a negative perception of it. \\n\\nAt this point, I was thinking that he had never been around it fr. Just grew up in a strict household in a strict place. Where for me, recreational weed use is literally the norm.\\n\\nHe asked me if I had smoked since our last conversation about it (where he said I could do it if I wanted, and just not to tell him), and I had so I told him yes. And he responded, he felt very disappointed in me. Obviously- I hated being told that. Like I am an adult.. I didn‚Äôt lie to him, I didn‚Äôt betray him. If I want to smoke weed once in a while, I should be able to do that without fearing my boyfriend is going to get mad at me for it.\\n\\nBut he finally dropped all of the lore, as to why he hates weed. He went through some family trauma with someone that was addicted to it and took advantage of his family when he was young, causing much harm.\\n\\nWhen he told me this, I was still caught up in being told what I did was disappointing and kept asking him to just have an open mind about changing his perception, so that it didn‚Äôt hold so much power and didn‚Äôt have to be an issue between us.\\n\\nObviously, I missed a very big moment where he was telling me something he hadn‚Äôt told anyone and had a very emotional effect on him. I wish I had just put my own feelings aside and been there for him. I know I made him feel so invalidated and disregarded, which breaks my heart.\\n\\nObviously I know that my experience and relationship with weed is not at all connected to that family member, but he cannot separate the two which I understand. I literally very rarely smoke, maybe once every three months, and always socially. Even without knowing this, I of course would never have it around him. But I just hated that I wasn‚Äôt doing something I enjoyed just because he had discomfort with it, when it wasn‚Äôt something around him at all.\\n\\nNow I know more, I know how deep of a thing this is for him.

       " 'TIFU by masturbating in front of the nurses in the hospital while waking up from anaesthetic - I am definitely going to delete this later, I\\'m posting this under my anon account for a reason. I\\'m just hoping that maybe there are some other people here who\\'ve done something similar or nurses that can tell me worse stories from their work to make me feel better about myself. Or at least maybe a little mockery will help turn this from a humiliating story to a funny one.\\n\\nToday I had an egg retrieval operation in the hospital as part of an egg donation. This is a surgical procedure in which a needle is inserted into the vaginal wall to the ovary, collecting mature eggs to be fertilized. (While normally you only have one, injections are administered for about two weeks beforehand to increase the number of eggs matured in one cycle-- in my case there were about 25 eggs). The retrieval is done under anaesthetic, which I\\'m going to blame for all my poor decisions.\\n\\nEverything was going swimmingly until I woke up. For about ten minutes I was totally fine. Then I felt like absolute shit. I\\'ve done this once before but it didn\\'t hurt this bad. It felt like period pain, if you were having twenty-five particularly bad periods all at once. The cramps were so bad one of the first things I did once it hit was roll over and throw up (though that could have actually been the nausea from the anaesthetic-- I am not sure).\\n\\nThere was an IV in my left arm so I didn\\'t want to curl up on my left on top of it, and I tried to curl up on my right but that left my left arm in very uncomfortable position too, so I opted to roll into the fetal position while lying on my back-- that is, with my knees lifted in the air up against my chest and my calves and feet hovering parallel to the bed. This did help with the pain a little. What I realised later when recreating this position at home later is it\\'s very difficult to get the blanket to actually cover your backside entirely like this, and the hospital blankets were not that big, so I\\'m reasonably sure that in trying to alleviate my pain I was also displaying my ass and genitals to all of the attending staff-- three nurses-- and possibly others in the recovery room as well.\\n\\nOne of the nurses went to fetch some kind of opioid to help with the pain. While that was happening, I was acutely aware of the intense ache in my vulva and pelvis. For the men in the subreddit who are not in the know, masturbating helps with period pain, and I was still reasonably sure that the blanket was covering me entirely and nobody would know. So in my delirious state I decided to rub the offending anatomy to try and reduce the pain. One of the nurses closed the curtain surrounding me and then he told me he was going to get me a second blanket \"for warmth\". When he returned with it he placed it a little lower over my body, covering my lower body and legs. I didn\\'t really put what this meant together until later.\\n\\nTo their credit, they took it very well and didn\\'t actually say anything, and it is possible they didn\\'t see it, but reflecting on their reactions and the chain of events in clear-eyed hindsight I\\'m pretty sure they did. To be fair, if any of them were present for the surgical procedure they would have seen me while I was unconscious as well, but it\\'s a different thing when I\\'m awake and, well, you know.\\n\\nAnyway, now I\\'m recovering in bed at home. The pain has went away but the embarrassment has only increased. At least I humiliated myself for a good cause, and I\\'ll probably never see these people again.\\n\\nTL;DR: Was in pain and woozy after an operation in hospital, may or may not have masturbated in front of the nurses.',\n",

       " 'TIFU by proposing to my girlfriend in the wrong way. - My girlfriend (20F) and I (21M) have been together since I was 15 and she was 14. We have an excellent relationship, we\\'ve only had about four arguments in six years, and none of them were serious. I have no doubt she\\'s the woman of my life.\\n\\nHere\\'s how the problem started: for some years, I\\'ve seen many women complaining about how frustrating it is to be a girlfriend for a long time. For example, some say \"I\\'ve been with the same man for 9 years and I\\'m still just a girlfriend\" and how uncomfortable they feel in that situation. I understand how bad that can be, and I wanted my girlfriend to know I take our relationship seriously. At the same time I\\'m far from being financially stable enough to get married, so my solution was this: I would propose now, but we\\'d get married in about five years. That way we could tell people we\\'re engaged, and she wouldn‚Äôt have to be a girlfriend for 11 years before becoming a fianc√©e.\\n\\nWe\\'re on vacation now, and yesterday I proposed to her. She was extremely happy, cried a lot, and I was happy and cried too. But when we got back to the hotel, she asked me how I wanted the wedding to be. I told her \"I don\\'t think it\\'s worth planning the wedding now since we\\'re only getting married in about five years.\" She instantly got sad and went to the bathroom for a few minutes. I apologized to her, but she was not talking to me (when she\\'s extremely sad she usually stays completely silent). After some time she said she wanted to talk about it on Friday, that it was okay, and she wanted to enjoy the rest of our vacation.\\n\\nIt\\'s clearly not okay I shouldn\\'t have done this. I thought she would be happy and understand my point of view (which we still haven‚Äôt talked about yet because I\\'m respecting her space), but now I think I tried to fix a problem that didn‚Äôt exist and ended up hurting her. Looking back she never complained about being a girlfriend for six years, I don\\'t know why I thought this was necessary.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n**UPDATE:** I followed the advice from the comments, and it was really just a communication problem. Earlier today, we talked about it. I explained what my idea was and showed her this post. She laughed about it and said that doing this suits my character, lol. She said she wouldn‚Äôt mind being my girlfriend for 10 years because we are still young and it didn‚Äôt matter to her. She mentioned that I could have explained my idea to her before proposing, but in the end it was fine and she said it was cute that I thought about doing this.\\n\\nI apologized a million times, and we decided together that I‚Äôll propose to her again in a few years, and the wedding will happen a year after the proposal, like a normal couple. She‚Äôll wear the ring I gave her because she liked it, and if someone asks us about our relationship, we‚Äôll say that we‚Äôre getting married soon.\\n\\nNow, addressing some things I‚Äôve seen in the comments: it‚Äôs important to me that we have a wedding (ceremony), but we are definitely going to live in the same house before our wedding. This year, I‚Äôve stabilized myself in a situation which I believe the best way to explain to an American is: you\\'re making $120k a year but instead of living in NYC, you live in a medium-sized city where the cost of an excellent life is $5k a month. So we‚Äôre definitely moving in together early next year, but our wedding will have to wait a little longer.\\n\\nSome people thought I proposed but didn‚Äôt want to get married (and that‚Äôs my fault for communicating poorly). I do want to get married, I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible right now. We both would rather move in together before having our wedding (we‚Äôve talked about it). Another clarification is that, for me, getting married means having the wedding, not moving in together. She thought I meant we wouldn\\'t move in for another 5 years, which isn\\'t the case. again, my fault for not explaining it well.\\n\\nThanks for all the comments!\\n\\n**TL;DR:** I asked my girlfriend to marry me but I only wanted to get married in 5 years and I ended up hurting her feelings.',\n",
       " \"TIFU by using parchment paper instead of aluminium foil - For some context, I moved into student accommodation about a month ago. My shared kitchen has a fan oven with multiple different settings, while I am used to using a gas oven where all you really control is the temperature. I didn't really know what all of the separate settings do, so I'd just turn on any that heats up the oven and works for what I'm making. \\n\\nI decided to try and bake some apples with sugar and cinnamon, and the recipe said that it must be covered in tinfoil while it's baking. I didn't have any but I had parchment paper so I figured that that must be fine and I didn't want to go out and buy tinfoil (the nearest shop is 20 minutes away and I didn't really have the time, + I just couldn't be bothered).

One of my two flatmates who was there at the time started pouring water into the baking tray, and the other flatmate went to open windows and doors while I took the tray out of the oven and ran it under the water to put out the flames. All I was left with were some apples with a goopy, undercooked topping, surrounded by the charred remains of the parchment paper. \\n\\nIt turned out that I had turned on the fan and grill setting, and the parchment paper must have touched the grill above it, which then started the fire. So yeah, I won't try baking again any time soon.\\n\\nTL;DR: I turned on the fan and grill setting due to being unfamiliar with fan ovens, covered what I was baking in parchment paper, the parchment paper touched the grill and set on fire. \",\n",

So I text the number and turns out it's a wrong number but the person using this number was a girl. We'll call her Lee, so me and her we get to texting. Things are going extremely well, we vibe and we do voice calls. No, we haven't shared any pics yet I didn't wanna ask and she kinda didn't bring it up. Our conversations get deep like we're bonding and I'm 80% honest with her about myself just keeping the minor details to myself \\n\\nAt this point feels like we've known each other forever, giving each other nicknames and stuff. One day she posts a status, on Whatsapp I view it and lord I know this girl. I work near her neighborhood she'd walk pass my work place every once in a while. I don't tell her that of course I play it cool. As if on cue, I get a video call. I put on a face mask and as I suspected it's the very same girl. We chat on call for a long time, the video calls get frequent, yes i still wore the mask now I'm thinking do I keep up this facade of acting like I don't know her or do I come clean. Believe me a part of me wanted to stay anonymous as much as I can. But my guilt conscious was eating me up. Today I wake up, text her and explaining everything.  Even showing her my pics and Jesus Christ of Nazareth the poor girl was mad furious. Can't blame her, now to her seems like I'm a stalker and a creep, she said she's blocking me and hates me for tricking her. Now it looks like I planned the whole thing.\\n\\nI forgot to mention this girl is pretty like really really pretty so you catch my drift. So you see how it looks when you look like me.\\nTL;DR: Texted a wrong number on accident, ended up bonding only for me to realize I knew her and had to come clean about who I am then for it to all go down the shitter because she now thinks I'm a creep.\",\n",
       " \"TIFU Alcoholism  - I just woke up, it's about 4am, I was drinking while my wife was at work. I don't remember going to sleep, and she's asleep on the couch. I can only assume she's pissed at me because neither of us particularly like that couch. I don't know why I keep doing this sort of thing, drinking till I forget the world, but I keep doing it. Better for a while, then I fuck up and get drunk. I don't want to be like this, but I keep finding myself in the same place; makes me wonder if I even want to actually be alive. \\n\\nI've had a near-death experience, getting shocked bad enough that I was apparently unconscious for a while, and I saw nothing. I saw the world at 60hz for a couple seconds (maybe?), then everything narrowed to a tunnel and then nothing. And it hurt, real bad. That's what they don't tell you about getting electrocuted: it hurts the whole time. \\n\\nI don't feel there's any great reward waiting for me after death, it just sounds peaceful. It's also something I just can't do. Yeah, there's nothing after, but there's also nothing after, and that sounds pretty boring. So I Guess my question is how do I stop drinking myself to death? I don't want to die, I don't want to hurt the people I love like that. But I seek oblivion. I love that moment when nothing seems to exist. To matter. When I can't remember. \\n\\nMy wife does not. I guess that's where the conflict stems from. I've got every reason to be happy, and I mostly am. But when I'm alone and it's quiet, I guess I'm not. And then I drink 'til I feel nothing. Then she gets home from a twelve hour shift to a dopey, drunk sonuvabitch she was dumb enough to marry.\\n\\nI hate being this way.\\n\\nTL;DR: I guess I'm trying to reconcile the call of the void with living a happy life.

       " 'TIFU by eating my wife\\'s \"special\" brownies. - Obligatory \"on mobile\" disclaimer. \\n\\nSo it\\'s not what you\\'re thinking. They\\'re not that kind of special. To give a little back story, my wife and I have been trying to eat healthier lately, tracking our calories and protein and vitamins, minerals, all that. Over the last few weeks, we\\'ve realized that, on a good day, we get maybe 15 to 20 grams of fiber, despite eating vegetables and fruit with at least 2 of our meals. So we\\'ve been dedicating extra attention to upping our fiber intake, and now we\\'re getting at least 20, sometime up to 40 grams a day. \\n\\nSo, today, I come home and my wife is sitting on the couch. I go into the kitchen, and there is almost a whole 9√ó13 pan of brownies sitting on the counter. I ask if she\\'s saving them. She says no. I ask if I can have some. She says \"of course baby, eat as much as you want, they\\'re healthy.\" That was all I needed to hear. I grab one and start eating it. It\\'s a little dry, texture is a little off, but it\\'s not bad. I start on dinner, eat another one. At this point, I think it\\'s important to say that the hardest part of keeping my calorie intake down is I snack if given the opportunity. Not bad when it\\'s carrots or cherry tomatoes, but if there\\'s sweets, they have to be out of sight or I\\'ll find myself just grabbing and eating without thinking about it. A bad habit from when I quit smoking and snacked to keep my mouth busy, I guess. \\n\\nAs I finish cooking, I realize I\\'ve eaten five of these brownies. So, I do the logical thing and grab a sixth, eating it as I walk of the living room to tell my dear wife, who said to eat as many as I want, that I might have to make her some more brownie and I\\'ll need the recipe for her healthy browned. She gets a confused look on her face, followed quickly by concern, and replaced almost immediate with amusement. \\n\"Honey,\" she says, \"how many brownies did you eat?\" \\n\"Six,\" I say, after swallowing the last bite, slightly apprehensive at her poorly concealed amusement. \"Why, is something wrong?\"\\n\"Well that depends on your time frame for wrong, honestly. Right now, no, nothing is wrong in 30 minutes to an hour? Maybe.\"\\n\\nAt this point, I\\'m beginning to get concerned, and she, thankfully, didn\\'t keep me waiting for long on the reason for her amusement. \\n\"I didn\\'t make those brownies. My coworker did. I told her about us needing more fiber and she said she had the perfect recipe. Each one of those brownies is supposed to have about 7 grams of fiber in them, and you ate 6 of them.\"\\n\\nAt this point, I knew I had made a horrible, horrible mistake, but I tried to reason with myself. Maybe I\\'ve been getting enough fiber that it won\\'t be like the time I jumped from almost no fiber to eating a fiber 1 bar with an Olli pop with my lunch and painted my backside with blue porta potty water 45 minutes later. Maybe it won\\'t be so bad, besides, how could 1 brownie have 7 grams of fiber? They weren\\'t amazing, but they were better than the fiber brownies you get at the store. Alas, my hope was for naught. No sooner had I finished dinner, and my stomach rumbled in a way that spoke of the horrors to come. Immediately, I made haste to the porcelain throne, yelling to my wife that she would have to serve dinner tonight. No sooner had I taken my seat that the floodgates were blown wide open. I\\'ll spare you the details, but suffice is to say that I was seated on my throne for over an hour, and needed a shower after. \\n\\nSuffice is to say, my rear is tired, the bathroom still smells of my regret, and my wife can\\'t look at me without chuckling and has made it known she will be telling the evil person who made the brownies about how well they worked on her poor, unsuspecting husband. I will be asking how healthy these random snacks are from now on.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR, in an attempt to get more fiber, my wife\\'s coworker made brownies with 7 grams of fiber and I ate 6 not knowing, and paid the price for it. \\n\\n\\nEdit to add the same copy and pasted reply I\\'ve put in comments\\nhttps://divaliciousrecipes.com/flaxseed-chocolate-brownie/#recipe\\n\\nThis is the recipe my wife\\'s coworker says she used as her base, but she changed it up to make them better. How, I don\\'t know, but she swears the only difference is they have more protein and a few more calories, but it\\'s not by much',\n",

I guess I had decided that I didn\\'t want to continue taking that long commute and paying the heavy price, and it was a good opportunity to get out of the membership.

He then proceeded to scale me like a furry, clawing ladder, leaving a trail of muddy paw prints across my chest and face.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the shower head, neglected in the chaos, had decided to go rogue. The gentle trickle became a powerful jet, soaking the entire bathroom.

He\\'s currently sulking under the bed, plotting his revenge, I\\'m sure.  The bathroom looks like a swamp monster threw a tantrum in it.

       " \"TIFU by getting a new hair stylist - A couple of years ago, I started going to a new hair stylist (I'll call her Maggie) for regular trims, layering, and highlights. I loved my hair the first few times I went to her, but after that, my hair was coming out noticeably different every time. I always asked for the same services and always just wanted a refresh/touch-up, no major changes, but she kept testing out new products and techniques without asking. After several of these instances, I was so disappointed with my cut and color and finally decided to go to a new salon. I never gave her a reason or anything, just stopped scheduling appointments with her. Fast forward to now, I have been going to a new stylist at a different salon (I'll call her Anna), and have been super happy with my cut and color the past few times I have gone to her. Today, I found out via social media that Maggie (1st stylist) just got a new job at Anna's salon (the place I am going now). Now, if I go for another appointment with Anna, there's a good chance Maggie will see me. Super awkward... I'm now considering if I need to find yet another salon and risk hating my hair again, just to avoid the embarrassment and awkwardness.

I sent the payment through Venmo, but despite repeated promises, the seller hasn‚Äôt provided any proof of shipment. All I‚Äôve gotten are excuses about how busy he is.\\n\\nLooking back, I realize that I was too trusting, and it frustrates me how easily I fall into that trap.

       " 'TIFU by telling my husband how much I was attracted to him  - See edits below for answers to some FAQs\\n\\nI (26 F) and my husband (28 M) have been married for 5 years and have known that him about that long as well. Before I get into this let me give a little backstory because it provides some necessary context. We both grew up in a high demand religion with a very intense purity culture. It is not uncommon in the culture of our religion to marry young and fast, and start having kids right away. We unfortunately fit right into that stereotype. We were just two horny young people who dove head in and there was no one around us telling us no. The last five years haven‚Äôt been easy but we do genuinely love each other and have both put in a lot of effort to make it work and this last year especially has been a good year for us. \\n\\nI mention the above because part of what we‚Äôve been working on is being more affectionate and intimate with each other. So we were in bed and we were just having some pillow talk, telling each other things that we liked about each other. At one point I told him that I thought about him all the time when he‚Äôs gone for work (works a very demanding job, with overnight 12.5 hour shifts), how handsome I think he is and how much I miss him.\\n\\nHere‚Äôs  where I fuck up- I also tell him I think about him when I touch myself and imagine that it‚Äôs him. He looks at me and looks away and is CLEARLY uncomfortable. He says ‚ÄúOh‚Äù. \\nAnd I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ ‚Äúoh? What‚Äôs wrong? Does that make you uncomfortable?‚Äù\\nAnd he says that it caught him off guard and he is a little uncomfortable.\\nY‚Äôall I was shaking in my boots. I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyou are my husband. I have two children with you. We‚Äôve been married and have been having sex for 5 years. Why on gods earth would it make you uncomfortable to know that your wife thinks of you in moments of private?‚Äù\\nAll he had to say to that was that it just surprised him. I pushed for more details but admittedly I probably sounded upset (because I was), he got defensive, so I just dropped it because I honestly don‚Äôt even know what to say. \\n\\nI should‚Äôve known it would go down like this. This man absolutely refuses to talk about sex outside the act itself. Will not sext, will not flirt, NOTHING, which is a complete 180 from when we were dating/engaged. It‚Äôs been a thing I‚Äôve tried to respect but also have had to talk him about and remind him that I‚Äôm his wife not his best buddy, thus us working on affection and intimacy with one another. I don‚Äôt know if the purity culture has just screwed with him and created a mental block in his head regarding sex, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs related to me and how he feels about me. I genuinely don‚Äôt know and I honestly don‚Äôt know if he knows either. \\n\\nAnyway I‚Äôm up and still thinking about it, I went to bed shortly after that conversation, just feeling really disappointed and somewhat rejected in a way. What I do know is that his reaction has definitely ruined my own ‚Äúprivate time‚Äù with myself because if he pops up in my head during it, I‚Äôll just remember what he said and it will totally kill the mood. Not sure if I even feel like I want to be physically intimate with him anytime soon either after that. I don‚Äôt know but hours later I‚Äôm still cringing on the inside thinking about this. Reddit if you‚Äôve been in this position, mine or his, please let me know and give me some insight!\\n\\nTL;DR: I told my husband I think about him during my own ‚Äúintimate moments‚Äù and his reaction ruined it probably for the rest of my life. \\n\\nEDIT I addressed these in the comments but thought I‚Äôd put it up here for all to see-\\n\\n1. Yes we both grew up Mormon, no we are not Mormon anymore and have not been for a few years now \\n\\n2. We both have our ‚Äúprivate time‚Äù and we are okay with each other doing. We are also okay with each other watching porn as well. I also know for a fact that my husband doesn‚Äôt do it often as he‚Äôs monitored constantly at work and then at home he‚Äôs always with us and usually falls asleep before me, so I don‚Äôt think those are the root of the problem here. \\n\\n3. It became very clear early on in our marriage that I have a high libido and he has a low one, so we‚Äôve had to navigate through that and haven‚Äôt always done it well. ',\n",

Every spell she texted for a profoundly long time, as I could ascertain with my frequent checks, growing angrier each time I beheld the face on the driver‚Äôs side of the car not even remotely interested in looking at her lethal weapon‚Äôs course as she set pace in my wake. How dare she text and scroll with such cavalier disinterest in her roadworthiness!!!!\\n\\nI was astonished, appalled, and outraged by this bold and illicit behavior, and as it continued, I was DETERMINED to show my rage at this rejection of all that is good and safe in the world in this motorist‚Äôs behavior. I started glowering ragefully at them, shaking my head and throwing my hands enough to be noticed ‚Äî and they eventually peeled off.\\n\\nWhen I looked over, finally outside of the mirror, at this passing lone sinner, and began shaking my head with a perfectly disgusted face to show my outrage ‚Äî I saw the texting woman in the passenger seat‚Ä¶ past the outline of a Black gentleman whose skin color had enabled him to blend into the dark seats in my eyesight, who was properly seated in the driver‚Äôs seat, no phone in sight ‚Äî and he was looking at me with an expression I‚Äôve never seen before or since that curdled into my angry visage into one cringing embarrassment: something akin to bemusement, confusion, pity, and being deeply disturbed, all at once.

       " \"TIFU by creating a fruit fly bar - So I drink a bit. Been drinking sours lately in particular while I fight my demons. I am ashamed of my drinking and try to hide my empties in the bathroom. The sours are strong and the fruit flies cannot resist them. So much that when I open a can they come out of the wordworks and I have to put my beer in front of a fan. There will be no bugs. I'll open a beer; and then, I am exaggerating, but am practically swarmed. Now here is where I messed up. When I was being filthy and irresponsible by not washing my empties out, it actually killed the flies because it was too strong. I started washing my cans out thinking it would fix my fruit fly problem; it just increased their growth exponentially. Now they drink the watered down sour, don't die, and I have a bunch of fruit flies. I have fruit fly traps setup all around them, but they only go for the empties. I am ashamed that I drink, but I am also ashamed of how much I've spent on fruit fly traps in the last couple weeks. I tried some home remedies too, but they keep going for the water down empties. My fuck up is probably from drinking in general, but let's focus on the flies. When I have the opportunity to clean up, they all go to the compost bin; I'll throw that out and then they go after the cats food. I'll go through a period of no flies, or I think so, and then I'll crack a beer and realize the flies are there again. Do they hibernate or lay dormant like fleas? I have enough spiders, there shouldn't be any flies. Did I mess up by propagating lazy spiders? I did notice that the house spiders will eat the jumping spiders if they catch them. \\n\\nTL;DR Made strong beer tolerable for fruit flies\",\n",

       " 'TIFU When I Broke a Toilet in Paris with My Monstrous Shit - So this actually happened over 2 years ago while my mom and I were in Paris. I was 18 at the time and had just graduated from high school. Since I graduated with my Associates Degree at the same time by taking dual enrollment classes in high school, my mom put together a special trip for the two of us to go to Paris for a week as my \"double graduation\" gift.  \\n  \\nCut to night 1 of the trip and I‚Äôm absolutely blowing up the bathroom after holding it in all day (hot girls have stomach issues, amiright?). I lost count of the amount of times I flushed the toilet after the eighth flush. I went through almost an entire roll of shitty ass hotel toilet paper in one sitting. The rest was a blur until I was finally done. Then, after the last flush, the toilet bowl water started bubbling rhythmically. Three bubbles. Blub‚Ä¶ blub‚Ä¶ blub. I pass it off as nothing to worry about and go about my day.  \\n  \\nDay 2: the bubbling is still there. Blub. Blub. Blub.   \\n  \\nDay 3: It‚Äôs happening quite regularly now, probably at a frequency of once every other minute. My mom and I were a little concerned, but passed it off yet again because we thought it would just go away‚Ä¶ Famous last words.  \\n  \\nDay 4: The next morning, I wake up to a horrendous odor and my mom calling for me from the bathroom. While we were asleep, the toilet overflowed and FLOODED our hotel room with poo water. That\\'s right, poo water \\\\[insert Bee Movie reference here\\\\]. The whole room reeked and the carpet was damp. We had to wear shoes inside the hotel room for fear of getting anything on our socks or bare feet. My mom, like the trooper she is, cleaned up as much of the mess as she could using the towels we had in the bathroom. The floor was still covered in shit and sewage, though, so she called the concierge to let them know about the situation, then sent me to go grab more towels from them. After I brought the extra towels, we mopped up as much as we could before we got dressed and ready for our plans that day. By the time we were almost ready to leave, we heard a knock at the door. It was the plumber.  \\n  \\nThe plumber didn\\'t speak much English but the concierge had already given him the run-down of the situation. We let him in and when he rounded the corner to see the bathroom and get a full whiff of the stench, he exclaimed what I can only assume was some curse in French. After around five minutes of attempting to plunge the toilet, he realized he didn\\'t have all of the tools he needed.   \\n  \\nThis is my mom\\'s favorite part: When he came back out of the bathroom, he looked at us and WAGGED HIS FINGER while repeating, \"No... no... no good... no...\" before leaving the room to go get more supplies from his vehicle. At this point, my mom and I were ready to go, so we left to get breakfast at a cafe that was about a 20-minute Uber ride from the hotel. We explored the surrounding area for a bit before Uber-ing back to the hotel.  \\n  \\nWhen we got back, the door to our room was propped open. The plumber was not alone. Two other men were now in our hotel room trying to fix the toilet. The craziest part? They had to \\\\*remove the toilet from the wall\\\\* because it was that bad. We didn\\'t plan on staying for long, we just had to get changed into nicer clothes to go to a restaurant we had made a reservation for that was more upscale than our casual clothes would allow. We grabbed our change of clothes, got changed in the lobby bathroom, then dropped off our things in the room before heading off to lunch.  \\n  \\nFast forward a couple of hours later: The three men are still there and the toilet is still off the wall. They gave us a rough estimate of when they would be done, which was probably going to be another 2-3 hours. During this exchange, they all kept shooting glances at us that were a mix of disgust and befuddlement. I can only imagine they were talking amongst themselves throughout the day saying things like, \"Ugh, these Americans and their bowels,\" and, \"What the actual fuck did those women EAT?\" We told them that the wait was completely fine, thanked them, and apologized profusely. When we got in the elevator, out of earshot, we burst out laughing because of how insane the whole thing was. We\\'re like children when it comes to poop/fart jokes, so even though this was a serious issue and we felt really bad for the plumbers, we still thought it was absolutely hilarious.  \\n  \\nWe had about an hour and a half to kill before we had to leave for our reservations at Versailles, so we decided to go for a walk to a quaint little bakery nearby that had some tarts we wanted to try, then brought our tarts back to the lobby where we sat for the next hour. Long story short, we returned at around 7:30 pm and were informed the room wasn\\'t quite ready yet as it was being cleaned and were told to return in about an hour. We thanked the concierge, apologized for the trouble, then went to grab a late dinner down the street.  \\n  \\nUnfortunately, when we got back to the room later that night, the shit smell lingered. We put two and two together and figured the plumbers had to have been there for at least 6 hours of the day from start to finish, given the first guy had arrived at around 10:00 am and they had to have all left between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm. We were still reeling from the whole situation and couldn\\'t help but burst out laughing for what seemed like the 50th time that day. After that, we made a rule that courtesy flushes were a must after two wipes so we wouldn\\'t run the risk of clogging or damaging the frail little toilet again.  \\n  \\nSince then, this has probably been the funniest personal story I\\'ve ever told. We\\'re going back to Paris in a couple of months AND we\\'re staying at the same hotel, so hopefully I won\\'t repeat the same mistake this time lol.  \\n  \\nTLDR: If you\\'ve ever wondered, \"How many Frenchmen does it take to fix a toilet?\" The answer is 3.',\n",

       " 'TIFU by washing my clothes in cold water  - Obligatory: not today, but the mistake is once again on my mind.  \\n\\nAbout two years ago, I went to northern California with my named beneficiary. We hiked along the coast and among the redwoods. It was lovely -- beautiful rugged coast, tall trees, faint aroma of barbecued Ewok.\\n\\nA few days after we got back, I developed a rash on my face and wrist. One of my eyes swelled nearly shut. I get contact dermatitis from Tide and other products, so I figured it was an allergic reaction. I tried to medicate with Benadryl and cortisone cream, but it kept spreading.\\n\\nAfter a few days of intense discomfort, I went to see a nurse practitioner. She said, \"That\\'s poison ivy.\" I told her that was not possible, because I had not been anywhere outdoors for a couple of weeks... except California, but the rash started a few days *after* I got home. She said, \"Well, then it\\'s poison oak. It can persist on clothing for weeks.\" \\n\\nI got the poison ivy soap. I got the poison ivy spray. I took repeated scalding showers and applied goo liberally. My face got better quickly, but my wrist stayed bad and then my left ankle and right calf got horrifically itchy. It was not like burning or pain, it was just an urgent need to scratch and it was *always* there. I realized I was \\'reinfecting\\' myself. \\n\\nI can\\'t be 100% sure, but I think I must have brushed a piece of clothing against poison oak while on our hike. I then managed to take the item off without contacting the urushiol, and then put it in my dirty clothes bag and brought it home to launder. I then washed that laundry in cold water, because that\\'s good for the clothes and the environment.\\n\\nBut cold water and detergent do nothing to urushiol. It\\'s an oil. It does not dissolve in cold water. Tumbling clothes around and around together in a warm dryer does give urushiol plenty opportunity to spread. Every single item of clothing in that load was exposed, and by the time I realized what happened, they had all been folded and put away. \\n\\nI collected every possible item of clothing that had been on that trip or had been touched by an item in that trip -- probably 70% of my casual wardrobe, in four or five loads -- and ran all of it through the washing machine twice on \\'hot\\'. I wrecked some wool socks, but honestly I couldn\\'t bear the thought of putting them back on, knowing they might be contaminated. Slowly, the rash got better, though my right calf was the last to stop itching weeks later. \\n\\nSo okay, lesson learned, that\\'s all behind me -- right? Except any time my right calf gets itchy -- sunburn, mosquito bite -- the whole thing gets itchy just like the poison oak. I got a mosquito bite on that calf in the last few days, nearly two years since the trip, and again the whole calf is itchy. I can treat it with OTC creams, but it\\'s still a huge annoyance. \\n\\nIt\\'s great to wash your clothes on the cold setting. They last longer! So does the planet! \\n\\nBut if you\\'re out where you might be exposed to poison oak or poison ivy, wash your clothes with warm or hot water when you get home. You won\\'t give half a fart about the saving the environment after you\\'ve spent two weeks trying to scrape it out from underneath your skin. \\n\\nI do still love the environment, but I\\'m also really glad washed all my underwear on the normal environment-destroying warm temperature after that trip. If my man parts had itched as much as my calf did back then, I would have lost my mind. \\n\\nTL;DR I washed clothes exposed to poison oak in cold water, thus spreading the poison to an entire load of clothing. The resulting exposure left me miserable for months, and the itching recurs from time to time. .',\n",

       " 'TIFU. But at least it smelled delicious for a minute. - I was working at home very late and got hungry so I threw a frozen egg, sausage, and cheese biscuit in the microwave. I cook most stuff in the microwave on a low setting. My oven has inverter technology so it\\'s particularly good at cooking slowly. Low-power cooking with an inverter allows the food to heat more evenly, and cooks certain things better - like without changing texture. These biscuits come out heated perfectly through every time. It\\'s truly amazing.\\n\\nSo I put it in for 6 minutes at 20% power. When it was done I flipped the sandwich over and set it for another 12 minutes. I returned to my desk and worked.

I didn\\'t think about it - it registered way in the back of my mind somewhere.\\n\\nAfter another couple minutes, I smelled someone baking a cake or something. It was a unique sweet aroma, and again it smelled delicious. For this, my conscious mind picked up on it just enough to sort of think \"Wow, that smells amazing, but why are my neighbors baking at 2:00 am?\"\\n\\nAnother minute, again deeply focused, I started to detect something uncomfortable happening, but I couldn\\'t pull my mind away from my work (ADHD hyperfocus is a bitch). Another minutes after that I became aware of what the discomfort was - I was something burning. My neighbors totally screwed up. Oh well. Again, I was deeply focused.\\n\\nAnother minute and the smell pulled me out of my work-focus and I thought \"They really burnt the shit out of their food.\"\\n\\nFINALLY, my brain was able to get a message to me - \"DUDE! YOU\\'VE GOT FOOD IN THE MICROWAVE! IS THAT WHAT\\'S BURNING!?\"\\n\\nI jumped up and ran to the kitchen and the smell got really strong, and then I saw the microwave. Thick, dense, brown-gray smoke was pouring out the top like some kind of industrial waste-burning chimney. The room was filling with the acrid smoke quickly. It was very uncomfortable to breathe. I opened the microwave and once the rest of the smoke cleared I saw my biscuit. A charred lump of black ex-food, smoldering, still emitting whisps of smoke.\\n\\nIt turned out that I set the oven time for 10 minutes but I was so focused on my work that I forgot to set the power to 20%, so the thawed biscuit continued to cook at 1100 watts for 8 minutes. My kitchen exhaust fan was on, so the aromas and smoke were mostly pulled out the window so it took a long time for it to reach me.\\n\\nSince I didn\\'t smell it quickly, the oven had the opportunity to cook the living crap out of the sandwich. It had probably been smoking for a couple minutes and I didn\\'t didn\\'t smell it. I opened windows and let the exhaust fan clear all the smoke. For the next week, everything in my kitchen continued to smell like that awful smoke. It\\'s now two weeks after that happened, and the kitchen is okay except for my expensive inverter technology microwave which still smells as if there\\'s currently burning waste inside.\\n\\nThe smoke was so dense it had to have coated all the electronics inside with thick soot. I\\'m sure the smell will go away, but at this point I\\'m thinking 4 months, and I imagine the soot will shorten it\\'s life.

I wrote this paper at a new centre (not the same one I wrote my IGCSEs at) thus I knew none of the people I was writing with (mostly pupils of the school where I was writing as a private candidate). \\n\\nAfter I finish my exam there is about 45 min left till my mom comes to pick me up and about 30 min of time left to finish the exam. I end up walking outside and sitting in their courtyard on a bench that has a view of the parking lot to check for my mom.\\n\\nAfter sitting alone for 10 minutes and just sending voice notes back anf forth with my best friend one of the guys from the exam comes and sits on the bencj opposite me. To preface I must say that I did find this guy quite attractive and would have loved to talk to him. \\n\\nI give him a small smile when he sits down just to greet him while making a voice note to my friend. I see him start to say something but stop when he sees I am on the phone. I continue talking to my friend assuming he is waitingfor his lift.\\n\\nAfter about ten minutes of sitting he gets up. I look to see but no lift has arrived. He proceeds to walk out of the gate and walk down the road to what I assume is his house. \\n\\nAt this point I feel really bad because I was fully ignoring him as I had a little crush on him and I assumed he was just waiting for a lift.\\n\\nI now don't know if I blew the poor guy off or if he was just sitting there.\\n\\nNote: we were the only people sitting on the benches at this point.\\n\\nTL;DR I blew off a cute guy that I would have loved to talk to and now he probably thinks I am a b word.\",\n",
       " 'TIFU by running out of antibacterial handsoap. - So I when I went to wash my hands this morning after using the bathroom, I was slamming the soap dispenser for like a solid minute, but was getting nothing. I was completely out of the antibacterial handsoap.  \\nSo I decided to have a quick look under the sink to see if we had any new bottles, and what I found was a gag gift my brother had gotten me, \"probacterial handsoap\".\\n\\nI was like, \"Awesome, this finally has a purpose.\" so I used it. Well, I\\'m starting to wonder if it was actually a gag gift now, because my head is pounding, my mini trashcan is filled with snot covered tissues and I\\'m coughing phlegm like a madman.  \\nSo I tried to look for the soap online, because there was no way it was actually the soap that made me sick.  \\nBut I couldn\\'t find anything about it.

       " 'TIFU by throwing up in a bag on the plane, and then dropping it - Sound pretty tame, I know, but trust me it‚Äôs a bit worse than that. This happened last year. I was flying long distance from the US to Sweden for a holiday. I‚Äôve had plenty of flying experience but I‚Äôve always hated flights as I get sick extremely easily and also tend to get anxious on the plane. My boyfriend sat behind me because we couldn‚Äôt get seats together, so I was stuck in the middle seat between a woman and another guy. An hour and a half before landing, I decided to order an instant soup cup because I wasn‚Äôt feeling good and pretty hungry. I downed it and half an hour later, the plane began to descend. I was already feeling the anxiety that had lingered for the entire flight. It was extremely bumpy and the turbulence was getting really bad. My stomach was churning and I prayed for the best, but unfortunately, I felt everything in my stomach rising up my throat. I immediately grabbed the vomit bag that was in front of me and within 10 seconds all of the soup that I ingested was out. I couldn‚Äôt really see what the reactions around me were, but I think they were pretty shocked. I kept going for another 20 seconds until I was done. I was shaking at this point, hands trembling while I hold onto the bag of bile. I stared into nothing, horrified, I have never done this before in my 10+ years of flying. But it‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs in the bag, and I‚Äôm fine, right? And then, the worst thing that could possibly happen at that moment happened, the plane shook violently and I lost grip of the bag. Oh fuck. The bag dropped and spilt all over the floor infront of me, landing on my shoes, the woman beside me‚Äôs legs and her shoes. I could‚Äôve died there and then. We were both lost for words but I tried to apologise as best as I can while she gave me some wet wipes to clean up and she took off her shoes to clean it. The guy beside me attempted to move away from me as best as he could, he was lucky to have escape unscathed. It took the entirety of the landing duration to clean up as best as we could. I apologised to her again after the flight landed and she said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay I work at an ER, I‚Äôve seen a lot worse.‚Äù Props to her for handling it so well and not going insane at me, ER workers are built different. Yes I did tell and apologise profusely to the flight attendants after the flight. Definitely was a horrible start to a good holiday.\\n\\nTLDR; Threw up on long distance flight in the bag but dropped the bag onto someone else.',\n",

I don\\'t consider myself shy but when it comes to expressing my emotions I have certain difficulties, so I mostly avoided talking with her, instead I just kept starting at her every time. 2 days ago I asked a mutual friend of ours if she was in a relationship with a dude, big mistake. Yesterday my crush sent me a message, I was all happy thinking she wanted to talk with me, but when I replied my delusion disappeared. She started by telling me that our mutual friend told her about my question, then she proceeded to tell me to stop staring and \"wondering\" at her and that she found that creepy and annoying. I felt heartbroken, I just made some excuses to finish this ordeal the soonest possible. And for some reason I don\\'t have the courage to talk with her directly and I think that all my chances of me being with her are non existent\\nTL;DR: I fucked up by starring and asking questions about my crush, and now I think my chances of being with her are near zero.

       " \"TIFU by friendzoning a girl - This whole thing starts exactly a year back, after I got out of a 4-year long relationship. It was my choice since a few months before breaking up I started feeling like the relationship was more of a chore, rather than a commitment. I decided to break up with my ex since I thought she didn't deserve that. She understood, and we ended the relationship in good terms.\\n\\nMy ex doesn't matter here, it's what happened after her. Literally a month after I broke up with my ex, I met this one girl through one of my closest female friends and she was great. She showed great interest in me, initiating conversation with me on the daily and was always very sweet to me. I liked her too, but then I thought of why I was single in the first place. I decided to not lead her on, and started making it clear I only wanted her as a friend, because I genuinely found her to be a great person to keep around, but I didn't want to risk it by dating her and it not working out because I wasn't in the right place to do it. I just thought it would've been selfish.\\n\\nTo this day she is a great friend to me and has become one of my closest ones through time. However, things have changed, she is now in a relationship and honestly it never bothered me. I never felt jealousy and they've been together for a few months now I think. Just this morning she texted me, asking for advice on a small issue they had going on. I don't even know what the fuck happened from that point on. I gave her advice, she said thanks, then next moment we started talking about my stance on relationships (I have told her that I've been avoiding them for a while) , then she started telling me about how she used to have a crush on me when we first met. \\n\\nI knew she did, but having her say it just felt different. I thought I moved on and that the feelings I had for her were platonic, but holy it felt soo much different. I like to live life with no regrets, but this is definitely it, and I do not enjoy the feeling. I still think I have no real interest in dating her, especially now that she has a boyfriend, but brother I can't stop thinking of what could've been. This shit has been on my mind all day and it's making my brain hurt.\\n\\nTLDR; Girl had crush on me right after I broke up with my ex. I wasn't ready for relationships, so I kept her as a friend. A year later she has a boyfriend and told me she used to have a crush on me. I give up on love.\",\n",
       " 'TIFU by losing my best friend over a misunderstanding - I play in a band with 2 other friends. one of them i have known for 9 years (im a sophomore now) and we barely ever have practices anymore. obviously, i wanted more practices, so in our band group chat, i put out a message that basically said \"hey everyone i think we should have a set day for practice every week, if you cant make it to practice, just tell me why and we can reschedule. if you CAN make it and just dont want to, then you should reconsider if you wanna be in the band. i dont want to cancel any more practices.\" one of the reasons we havent had practices is because the friend of 9 years kept cancelling. He would also barely tell me why saying \"i have shit to do\" and last week he cancelled because he wanted to practice by himself. He never told me any other reason as to why he couldnt make it. i told him that he just didnt want to go to practice on saturday and yet again he said he had shit to do. i told him that he never said any other reason other than wanting to practice alone. he told me he had other responsibilities and i told him to just find another date that he is free to practice. his response was telling me to put a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger. i asked him if he was free to practice this week and he told me probably not because he had shit to do and i asked him what he had to do. he ended up telling me a reason that he had never told me before, expecting me to know that it was the reason he couldnt make it. i felt horrible that i didnt know, i apologized, sent him sympathies, said we didnt have to worry about the band until his situation got better but he didnt care. he ended up telling my ex, who now hates me, she told her friends (and also wouldnt let me tell my side of the story), i have lost everyones respect, my friend hates me, even though i feel awful for misunderstanding, everyone hates me and i lost my best friend.

       " 'TIFU by eating a cinnamon roll - This happened about an hour ago, so I\\'m still awaiting the consequences.\\n\\nMy wife got up very early this morning to make cinnamon rolls for a friend who was visiting us and left this morning.  There were leftovers, and she told me that they were in the kitchen if I wanted some when I got up.  After waking, I went to the kitchen and grabbed a roll and tossed it in the toaster oven to rewarm it.  Then I opened the fridge to grab the cream cheese icing she made.  The last time she did, I had mentioned the recipe was a little *too* cream-cheesy, so she tried a different recipe this time.  There it was, in a glass measuring cup on the top shelf.  At this point it was cold and hard to spread, so I popped out a few tablespoons and put it on my now hot roll and let it soften and then spread it around.\\n\\nI sat down at my work computer and at my roll while checking emails and messages.  As I ate, I noticed the icing wasn\\'t particularly sweet, but also didn\\'t taste like cheese at all.  But it was also a bit smoky?  Or maybe that was the cinnamon roll?  Either way, I was hungry and I finished my roll and my first morning meeting.  Curious about the icing, I asked my wife if she used the recipe my sister had sent us yesterday, and she said she had.  I noted it was a bit smoky and not very sweet and she was confused.  I mentioned where I had pulled the frosting from, and she cackled, \"THAT\\'S NOT ICING, THAT\\'S BACON GREASE!\".  So I responded in kind, \"WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE ICING?  AND WHERE IS THE ICING??\"  Apparently, the icing was on the counter, still in the mixing bowl.\\n\\nAs I write this, my stomach is occasionally gurgling, like a thunderstorm on the horizon, and my wife is shaming me to her sisters and mine, and anyone else she can get ahold of.  I expect in a few hours greased lightning will be shooting from my anus and my wife will be laughing outside the door.  I\\'ll die steadfast in my belief that bacon grease looks just like icing, and honestly didn\\'t taste half bad on the cinnamon roll.\\n\\nTL;DR: I accidentally put several tablespoons of bacon grease on my cinnamon roll instead of cream cheese icing, and ate the whole thing.',\n",

Among the many selections, I noticed on the corner of my eyes, they served, as optional sides, Asian chili peppers. The way that we usually eat it is bite a portion of it after you took a bite of your food to make your food spicy. You can also use it for cooking ingredients to spice up your dish, but this time, the host served it raw on a bowl.\\n\\n\\n\\nYa boi here is accustomed to eating many spicy foods throughout his life &amp; even ate Asian chili peppers plenty of times, so this is nothing to me! I grabbed a good amount alongside my foods because I will go to town with this peppers! I noticed some people took a tiny bite off the peppers, but not me! I haphazardly bit off half of the peppers with each bite of my food, so if my math is mathing, 1 pepper is good for 2 bites. I took it like a champ! Every time I get more foods, I get more of these peppers, and I swore, I think I consumed more peppers than the other guests combined.

This was more a formality than anything else, as my partner and I aren\\'t especially religious.

They read this story about a teacher whose student found out his dad may not be his dad, due to having a blood type that would not be possible based on his parents blood types.\\n\\nA little background info: I will sum up my family relationship as a whole by saying it is straight up complicated and I have the therapy bills to prove it lol. My parents divorced a few years ago and my mom moved away. I have since started to heal and work on myself instead of laughing everything off and detaching.\\n\\nNow, I have always had little suspicions about my dad being my bio dad. I can see where I look like my mom, but not my dad. The features I share with my sister, are my moms. I have a few that nooo one in my family has. My dad was not on my birth certificate, which was vaguely explained. But when looking for my birth cert years ago I found my mom‚Äôs divorce papers from AFTER I was born. My parents got married when I was 2 or 3 I think. But it‚Äôs never mattered deep down because my dad is my dad and that will continue to be the case. I have no interest in changing that regardless so besides a few jokes here and there I never looked into it.\\n\\nThat is, until I decided to watch that episode, and without thinking but just being excited about punnet squares, text my dad asking his blood type. Now my mom is type O, and I know this bc what kind of narcissist would she be without informing everyone that she is a universal donor. So when my dad said A+, I went ‚Äú‚Ä¶..‚Äù and speedily opened up google and what do you know THEY CANT MAKE A B- BABY LIKE ME NOW CAN THEY\\n\\nI verified with him my mom is O and then told him to call me. Then IMMEDIATELY REGRETTED IT and breathed a sigh of relief when he said he was golfing and would later. And then IMMEDIATELY called my grandma (she‚Äôs a real one, ultimate confidant) and asked if she knew any secrets and explained the situation (and how genetics works which was a journey and made me sound real smart, so at least there‚Äôs that) and she was not helpful but bless her for trying. \\n\\nChatted with my dad on the phone, he was kinda like wtf and he looked for his blood donor card while we chatted about things. Books, tv, his girlfriends kids starting school. We were both pretty chill about it. He couldn‚Äôt find it but did tell me that my mom was actually still very married to this man, but he said they had a horrible relationship, and it seems like they may as well have been estranged/separated/whatever like I was told. But they lived together‚Ä¶..neither of us seemed surprised, and later over text he said he was always curious but it wouldn‚Äôt change anything. \\n\\nSo, we may take a Walgreens paternity test this week when we have our planned dinner. I feel incredibly guilty for making this a thing when I‚Äôm either completely desensitized to the point I don‚Äôt care, or I really don‚Äôt care. Either way, it does not change anything for me. He will remain my dad that I love and look up to, and I will not be going on some ‚Äúwho is my real dad‚Äù kind of journey. That‚Äôs not my thing. However I may have just inadvertently hurt my dad, causing or reopening a wound that I feel so guilty for. I wish I had not been curious, I pray that he really is all ‚Äúwow color me surprised‚Ä¶not‚Äù about it like he seemed.

       " \"TIFU by impulsively buying a gift for my friend  - I (23M) have been friends with R (22F) for 3.5 years. She has been in a relationship for over 5 years and is currently in an LDR. May 2023, I realised I developed some feelings for R, and requested for some space in our friendship, so that I can sort out the feelings. I went to therapy, worked on myself and was able to move past the feelings and got in contact with R again and we slowly began to become friends again. Few months ago, we had an honest conversation about although she has moved past the incident, she sometimes gets uncomfortable and overthink if she is giving me some signals. The main reason for this is that unfortunately I am an overwhelmingly clingy person and can often give a lot in friendships and sometimes that can be a lot for her and can make her uncomfortable. She also confesses that she hasn't had any close guy friends, because most of them would develop feelings for her and then cut off contact with her and I am the only friend who started talking to her again. We had a discussion and decided that I will try to respect her boundaries more and she will try not to overthink too much whenever we are just being friends. \\n\\nNow, let's come to what happened last weekend. I went on a trip with some of my friends (but not R) and I found a really cool hat which was perfectly R's style and 100% would have suited her. I did not think about it properly and impulsively bought it for her. It costed me 15 Dollars, which is not too bad for me. When I gave her the hat, I realised she actually got a bit uncomfortable. Then she pointed out the discussion from a few months ago, that this is what she was talking about that me buying something for her, is a fine line, but is kind of crossing the boundaries and makes her a bit uncomfortable. It immediately hit me then that I came on too strong, and seemed like a creep because I bought something specifically for her. She did say that she knows that I didn't have bad intentions and was just trying to be a friend, and she doesn't like saying this either, but this is something that did make her uncomfortable. We did decide that I will take the hat back, but I feel like a shitty person at the moment. I definitely messed up really bad and in hindsight it all was kind of creepy. At this moment, I am not concerned about how she sees me, but I am really worried that I hurt a good friend of mine. I did apologise to her profusely but that won't fix the fact that I did hurt her.

       " 'TIFU by yelling about dildos. And not getting to pet the monkey - I live I a conservative red state. I had to attend a funeral in another state last week. To do this I had to leave my 14 year old son alone overnight. He\\'s a pretty good kid and I didn\\'t even think twice about it. All he had to do was get up and go to school and I\\'d be home after school that night. \\n\\nWell on my way out the door I jokingly said \"no parties\" thinking nothing of it. \\nI attend the funeral. Make my way home. Everything is good. \\n\\nSaturday comes around, I wake up, step outside to smoke. And there\\'s a note on my door.. it says,\" I have pictures of your son sucking a big pick veiny dildo. I\\'m almost as big. Want to let let me smash\"\\n\\nLe sigh.. it\\'s 7 am on a Saturday. I\\'m too old for this shit.  So I immediately check my box of adult toys that I keep under my bed. And be damned if I\\'m not missing a big pink veiny dildo. I woke my son up, shoved the note in his face and I\\'m like \" what is this\".\\n\\nBeing a typical teenager he\\'s like \" I don\\'t know\" \\nThen I\\'m like \"where is it\"\\nAgain \" I don\\'t know\" \\n\\nIt\\'s now 715 in the morning on a Saturday and I\\'m on my way to his friends house. Madder than hell. I knock on the door. Mom answers the door with the cutest little baby money on her shoulder. I ask for her son. She brings me two sleepy teenage boys. \\n\\nFirst thing I do is show her the note. Her son tries to blame his friend.. but Mom is not having it and says bull shit that\\'s your handwriting. So now I know who wrote the note. Some kid I never even met. \\n\\nThen I have to proceed to yell at these 2 sleepy teenage boys about privacy. And how violated I feel. This went on for a good 10 minutes. Cause I was mad and felt violated. Lucky the boys mom was very considerate, and let me say my piece. She had seen pictures and videos of whatever they did with the dildo. All the pictures had been deleted by the time I got to them. \\n\\nLadies and gentlemen do you know how hard it is to yell at 2 sleepy teenage boys at 7 30 am on a Saturday.. When all you want to do is pet the little baby monkey. But you can\\'t cause you\\'ve been yelling for the last 10 minutes and have scared it. \\n\\nTldr: went out of town. Kids got into my adult to box and took pictures with my pink veiny dildo. And I didn\\'t get to pet the monkey',\n",

They were right. I\\'ve been using it as my primary porn search engine ever since. This morning I logged onto my work computer and they did a system \"upgrade\". Anything we had customized on our desktop was reset and they removed all browsers aside from Microsoft Edge for whatever reason. Imagine my surprise when I click the address bar and my entire search history is visible... on my work computer. The worst part about it is that I only ever use bing for porn, so it looks like the only thing I ever look up is porn.

       " 'TIFU by announcing my separation from my spouse. - This did not happen today, but just about a year ago. At the time, my wife and I were married for about a year.  My wife and I have very opposite interests, but we both support each other in the things that the other loves.  \\n\\nFor example, I love going to different conventions, dressing up in costume, meeting celebrities, and checking out the unique merchandise that is sold. My wife is a big football fan, and will never miss a game if she can help it. My wife will come to conventions with me and I\\'ll watch the games with her and occasionally we make it to one in person.  \\n\\nA lot of people have questioned our dynamic because of our interests. To distill it down simply, I was a theater kid who wrote for the school newspaper and she played softball and loves football. People asked how on earth we fit together, even my mother, but we balance each other very well and I can\\'t see myself with anyone else.  \\n\\nMy wife pointed out to me at one point that even if my interests aren\\'t her thing, she loves that when I do my favorite things, the fact that I want her to be a part of them speaks volumes about how I feel about her and I feel the same way.  \\n\\nOn to the fuck up. Last year we attended a game for her favorite NFL team. Her dad bought tickets for the entire family and invited us to get there early to tailgate in the parking lot.  \\n\\nAs we were getting ready, my wife stated that as we would be grilling in the parking lot and going through a crowded stadium, it might be prudent to leave our wedding rings at home. Earlier in the year, a stone fell out of mine when we were on vacation, and I searched for an hour before finding it. So I agreed with her.  \\n\\nI jokingly asked her what we should say if anyone asks why we\\'re not wearing our rings. My wife rolled her eyes and said nobody would notice that. I said that someone was bound to notice it and we need to come up with something funny to say. We decided that if anyone asked, we would whisper, \"Well, we\\'re working on things...\" and just leave it at that.  \\n\\nWell, we arrived, had a great time, and nobody said anything. We posted several group photos to Facebook and Instagram along with photos of us grilling in the parking lot. About ten minutes later, my mother texted me.  \\n\\n\"Why aren\\'t you guys wearing your wedding rings in the photo you put up on Facebook?\"  \\n\\nI showed it to my wife, and we both cracked up laughing.  \\n\\nSo I sent the following back, \"Well, we\\'re trying to work on things, but the tickets were already purchased, so...\"  \\n\\nWe had a good laugh, forgot about it, headed inside, and had a great time.  \\n\\nCue the end of the game. We headed out to our car, waited in the queue to get out, and then began to drive home.  \\n\\nAbout five minutes into the trip, notifications start going off on my phone. I hadn\\'t realized that the stadium had terrible cell service, was essentially a dead zone, and didn\\'t bother to connect to the stadium WiFi.  \\n\\n\"I know you\\'re kidding, but please confirm that for me...\"  \\n\\n\"It\\'s really not funny to joke about. I\\'m very nervous about you guys...\"  \\n\\n\"What does that mean you\\'re working on things? Why aren\\'t you wearing your rings?\"\\n\\n\"Please pick up your phone.\"  \\n\\n\"This is not to week to do this to me, I am freaking out right now!\"  \\n\\n\"Why aren\\'t you answering your phone?\"  \\n\\nBy the time I called to assure her that I had simply been joking, she had already called multiple relatives freaking out that my wife and I were splitting up and I wasn\\'t answering the phone. When they heard the details, everyone else thought it was pretty hilarious. My mother, however, did not, and is still angry that we pulled that on her.  \\n\\nTl; Dr - Posted photos without our wedding rings on social media. Led my mother to believe we were breaking up and due to no service, she didn\\'t find out it was a joke until 6 hours later.',\n",

Every time I reach for him, he says, \"Dada, no poke.\" He still wants to go outside but won\\'t touch any of the playground equipment except the swings.\\n\\nThe worst part? He somehow managed to shock himself on the metal stairs, and now he won\\'t hold the railing either, which is definitely not safe for a toddler.\\n\\nSo yeah, no more playground for us for a while.

He showed up the next day, was very nice and understanding.\\n\\nGenerally it wouldn't have required him to come into my home, but unfortunately I don't have the fuse box labeled so I couldn't just go hit the switch. I have 3 cats however, and they like to hang out in my bedroom. I don't want to close the door to my bedroom because their food, water and litter boxes are in the living room. \\n\\nThe man went into the basement to get to the fuse box, and the doorway to my bedroom with the door wiiiiiiide open is right by the door to the basement. He had to try a few switches before getting the right one, and in retrospect I wish I asked him to help me get my fuse box labeled. That aside, he turned off the power in my bedroom at some point. But that wouldn't really do anything right? \\n\\nWell, I found out that, no, that *would* actually do something.

I didn't think much of it. I paid for his service and he left.\\n\\nAfter that, I went into the basement to check that none of my cats went down there.

This time I *really* looked into my room at the light. \\n\\nI was watching it change colors when I realized something. I was so used to it that I hadn't thought twice about where the light was placed. It was in a very dark room on top of a display case full of adult toys. I keep my room dark so it was hard to see much, but it was obvious what was in the case even in the dim light. That would have been bad enough, unfortunately that was not all. I air dry my toys after cleaning them by putting them *on top* of the case. In front of the light was a large dragon dildo. And in front of that was a second *larger* dragon dildo. \\n\\nI understood why the electrician smiled at me the way he did. He *saw*. \\n\\nI gave him 5 stars online with zero comment. \\n\\nTL,DR: I hired an electrician to fix an outlet, and accidentally exposed him to my silicone sculpture collection. \\n\\nETA: I'm a grown man in my 30s.\",\n",

Because of this, I just avoided bringing sweets all together and just kept them to neighbors or something of I was stressed.\\n\\nIt came to a head this month because for work we started our month long charity fundraiser. We were finally given permission to do a bake sale to raise money so I jumped in because I am used to mass production. So I made quite literally 200 dozen cookies (if not more), about 40 loaves of banana bread, peanut brottle, snack mixes of all kinds, and easily 45 dozen muffins over the course of a month. And whenever I brought product in, our coworkers would scavenge the boxes before even getting to the sell table and more times than none sold out of product within 12-18 hours. Meanwhile, my sister made cinnamon rolls and brownies and sold almost none in 2 days. She then went off in a huff, made a small scene about throwing everything in the garbage, and never brought product in again. \\n\\nNow, the fundraiser is over so obviously the bake sale is done. But now she hears from all of our customers and coworkers about how amazing the food was and of ill ever make more. Several regulars came in asking for the recipes. My sister made a whole show and said \"the stuff isn\\'t even from scratch\". Which is a lie and she knows it. The only thing that wasn\\'t 100% scratch was the muffins and it was still a dry mix. But one customer told her \"I don\\'t care of it\\'s not from scratch, they taste delicious!\". And since then, she has not brought anything to work, doesn\\'t want to bake, and stopped talking to me about opening up her own bakery. I feel like an asshole but I also feel like she needed a reality check a bit.\\n\\nWhich by the way, I raised almost $6000 by myself with the food. And I spent some 200 hours of my own personal time for the month to make this stuff on top of my 50 hr a week job and 2 smalls kids. I am exhausted haha\\n\\n\\nTL:DR. Little sister hates that I don\\'t always make from scratch nor listen to her advice, then got butt hurt that my baked goods sold better than hers.',\n",
       " \"TIFU by being complacent while using a log splitter - Apologies in advance for typos. For reasons that will become apparent I'm typing this with my non-dominant hand.\\n\\nA couple months ago my dad brought down a couple trees by his home. My parents live in an old farmhouse so he needs the wood for heating during the winter. Usually I help split it by hand but his year he decided to be sensible and rented a gas powered log splitter.\\n\\nIt was fantastic. 22 tons of hydraulic pressure tore even the largest and most knotted logs apart in seconds. What would normally be four weekends of work went by in six hours. \\n\\nWe were careful the entire time. One person grabs logs, the other loads it, and hands stay off the lever until everyone knows a clear. \\n\\nUntil the end. When we had five logs left we came across a log where half of it has grown perpendicular to the rest. There was no nice fork to aim the splitter at and the wood brought the blade to a dead stop every time we tried to split it. There were clear weak points I could see, but the log was large enough that it would overhang the edge and fall off the splitter if I tried to align those spots with the blade. But if I put a hand on the side of the log I could hold it steady while keeping it lined up. \\n\\nSo I did something dumb. Five logs before I could go eat and this was the only one that looked difficult. It'll be fine, right? Just hold it steady for a couple seconds, split the log, then go inside. Easy.\\n\\nNot easy. The log twisted the second the blade touched it, trapping my finger between the log and the steel strike plate at the back. Remember those 22 tons of pressure? Turns out that's a tiny bit more than a finger can take before crushing. I pulled the lever back immediately, but it was too late. \\n\\nFortunately only some of my finger got pulped completely. I'm at the hospital right now to see how much can be salvaged. Any related puns or nicknames you have for me while I wait (90 minutes and not triaged yet...) would be appreciated.\\n\\nTL;DR - tried to hold a log steady while splitting it and crushed my finger when it shifted\",\n",

       " \"TIFU by Helping a Friend Move and Getting Heat Exhaustion (Or Stroke?) - Today started out fucking awesome. I was gonna help one of my greatest homies move back to our hometown. Let's call him C, I'll be accompanied by another buddy, J. J and I left town about noon and drove about 30 mins to the next town over where we found C hanging out with his gf's mom, she's gonna be T. She was driving a Uhaul for him. C had a pretty big distaste for his landlord/roommate which will become important later. I also got myself a red bull and brought no water, which will also become important later. T will stay in the car while us strapping young men take care of business.\\n\\nThings went very smoothly for us, C's landlord kept butting in but largely left us alone and C was admittedly kind of an asshole to him, which still has me pretty miffed because I think we could've solved what happened next in a civil way. C's landlord was very unhappy because my buddy didn't exactly give notice. We threw a bunch of bags in the trash can and this old man starts throwing a shit fit, he comes out ranting and raving in that righteous drunk old man rage and starts grabbing trash bags out of his trash can and throwing them into the Uhaul. He got one bag in there before I got up in his face and told him to stop being an asshole, I further explained that he could've asked us nicely and we would've taken the bags out of there. He fucked off continuing to rant and I grabbed those bags out of the trash can and set them on the curb for now.\\n\\nOnce we packed everything up, C had gotten everything from the house except some insulin. He started throwing the trash bags back i to the trash can, though J and I had already planned to just take it and toss it elsewhere. I guess C just really hated the landlord. T stepped out with us and J and I watched C start doing this. I immediately knew this old fucking man landlord was about to cause a scene so J and I head back to my car and I hoped things didn't escalate. Well, the old man comes out, starts throwing a fit, and they get into a tussle where I haul my happy ass over to them. T is yelling at them to break it up. By the time I get there, they had broken up but this old fuck goes back inside yelling about some crazy shit, I'm half expecting him to come back packing heat but thankfully he just calls the cops. Unfortunately, C has left his damn insulin inside.\\n\\nWe wait and the police arrive. C and J are hanging out in my car while I sit with T on the back of the Uhaul. The trash is and will remain in the landlord's trash can to be his problem. Right before police arrive, the old guy comes out to T and I and NOW starts trying to be nice to us. He offers us a voucher if we just take the trash to the dump. We tell him that we just want the insulin and we'll gtfo. A cop pulls up while he makes this proposition and he tells to the sheriff that he thinks we got it handled. I yell over him that no, Mr. officer I think you should stick around. As I walk around, low and behold I fucking know the sheriff, which may or may not have helped our case. \\n\\nThe sheriff is incredibly polite and pretty much takes C's side over the whole thing. He escorts C and the landlord inside and I didn't hear details but that trash was not coming with us and that insulin definitely was. Nobody was arrested and we left the place without further incident. J and I rode together and we were a little peeved at C for instigating but that old dude was definitely an asshole. I was just glad that it was over, and I was thirsty as fuck.\\n\\nI'm driving home and I start feeling a headache come on once we get into our hometown. I stop and get some water and we continue to the place C will be staying. Once we get there, I help unpack and start feeling real sick out of nowhere. My head and heart are pounding, I was pretty sure I had a migraine coming on. I was sweating like crazy and drank my whole water bottle. I stopped helping and sat down awhile. J gave me some ibuprofen. My buddies definitely could tell I wasn't doing so good and kept checking on me until I told them that I was just gonna head home and lie the fuck down. I am so glad I did, but I think I should've probably taken my happy ass to the hospital.\\n\\nI got home clutching my head and rushed inside. I vomited up that whole water bottle and all the ibuprofen before I stripped and sat and in the cool shower for like 40 minutes. My eyes especially felt really droopy and I was so, so, so very tired, if that makes sense. That headache might've saved my life because I absolutely could not sleep until it was gone. I suspect it was probably some good old heat exhaustion or heat stroke fever that had set in before I cooled myself down. After I got out of the shower, I lied in bed where my head continued to pound and I weirdly kept forgetting to breathe or was breathing real shallow so I kept kicking on deep, manual breaths until I managed to sip down a little water and 2 more ibuprofen. The head pain subsided, I could drink water if I was slow and laid down on my right side, and I took 2 more ibuprofen and finally felt well enough to fall asleep. I definitely should've gone to the doctor, the more I read the more I think I could've accidentally killed myself had I not cooled myself off ASAP. I woke up about an hour ago, my head is sore as fuck but I feel alright again and I think that today, I fucked up.\\n\\nTL;DR I helped my buddy move with no water on hand. I think I got heat exhaustion or stroke but somehow managed to treat myself with seemingly no permanent damage to myself.\",\n",

       " \"TIFU throwing my used sanitary pad. - Hi, long time lurker here and this one is probably the most embarassing and just totally panic inducing thing I did in my teenage years so yeah it didn't actually happen today but a few years back. I had just started highschool and the school management was just basically non-existent. Chances of there being a garbage bin in the washroom were like 0.002% which is ridiculous considering it was an all girls school. So there was no proper place to dispose used pads and girls would just bring a garbage bag, put the used pad in it and then had to keep it in their school bags which was disgusting ofcourse. We had an empty pocket reserved for that purpose in our school bags. There was only one stall in the floor my classroom was and it was in the balcony area, thankfully the stall had three walls and a door that had a lock. But the sink was in the open, I hope you get the picture. And the school building was facing a two story complex which looked like a haunted house in a narrow lane. There was a big garbage container located right in the front of apartment complex and it's lid was broken so it was always half open.\\n\\nNow you might know where this is going. So I was on my period and had to change, normally I'd do what everyone did with the used pad which is wrap it in 3-4 layers, put in the garbage bag and into it's reserved pocket in the school bag. But I suddenly got this bright idea of aiming the garbage bag right into the garbage container on the street. And I was on 4th floor. This was the day I accepted that my aim is total shit when the garbage bag in which the pad was landed right at the edge of the roof of the complex. My heart jumped out of my chest the moment I realised what I have done and I started panicking. I went back to class and I was sweating profusely, told my friends what just happened and now all of us were panicking. We went back to check and see if by some miracle it fell down but no, it was still there, unmoved. One friend came up with the bright idea of throwing something else at it to make it fall down but we couldn't muster up the courage because teacher's office was right above.\\n\\nNow though I had never seen anyone on the roof ever before, I knew that a family with lots of kids lived there and well kids are curious and unpredictable. But this one curiosity could literally traumatize a kid. I imagined the parents suspecting the school because of obvious reasons and making a complaint, then the witch-hunt following it. Gosh, now everyone was panicking and making up scenarios so we took a BLOOD oath that we'd never open our mouths if ever questioned. And it became a daily routine to check on the poor garbage bag sitting on the roof. I had never wished for a thunderstorm so much before but that never happened. Then after 3 months of praying and hoping, it was gone one day, finally out of the sight. Saying I was relieved would be a huge understatement, we even went out for ice-cream to celebrate surviving that lol.\\n\\nTL;DR : Aimed a used pad at the garbage container, missed it and it landed on the roof of a complex where a family lived.\",\n",

I forgot I had some crunchy snacks over there too so a grabbed a random bag. I chugged my water and opened the bag. \\n\\nWarning sign number 1 artificial smell was quite... noticeable. Pfft I buy crappy junk food often it's probably fine. It's still feels like a bag of chips. \\n\\nWarning sign number 2 I don't remember buying rectangular chips recently. Pfft I'm just getting old. Bad memory runs in the family remember. My god the moment I touched it to my tongue, before even tasting it fully, 'this doesn't feel like food'. \\n\\nI still had full faith in my blind snack so I start chewing. 'This doesn't taste like chips'. \\n\\nThe 'artificial' smell got stronger and I gave up on saving my phone to light up my room. I needed a trash can. What the fuck am I eating? After find a good place to spit that shit out I look at the package I picked up. Generic brand salad toppings. Specially wontons. I haven't eat a salad let alone made one in YEARS. The artificial flavor was rotting bread and oils. I didn't know bread could be so close to being spicy. My tongue still feels betrayed and I am sorry for my hubris that lead me here.\\n\\nTl:dr I ate old wontons after blindly grabbing for food in the dark. Flashlights are important.\",\n",
       " 'TIFU by adopting the wrong cat.. - This is far less harmful than it sounds. About 2 weeks ago my partner and I went to a cat cafe and had a great time with this sweet sweet kitty. She let us hold her, she was head butting us, amazing. We looked at the board of kitty profiles and read that her name was Tiger and her description was great! Friendly, 2-4 yrs old, found on the streets with 3 kittens and ready for a forever home. We applied, on a Friday we got confirmed that we could take her home, amazing, scheduled to do so on Tuesday. \\nI was walking around town with a couple of my friends that Saturday. The cafe has a big window where you can see all the cats, I suggested we go look at my girlie! The girl working the register told me where she was hanging out. I bring my friends to the window‚Ä¶that‚Äôs not Tiger? She got it wrong right? Whatever I met the kitty a week or so ago maybe my perception of her size or coloring was totally off. Oops. \\nTuesday comes, we go in, cat carrier in tow, sign papers. Tiger walks over I say ‚ÄúOh she can tell we‚Äôre taking about her!‚Äù I get up to pet her and the rep goes, ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs Zebra.‚Äù And brings Tiger over. That‚Äôs..not who I thought we were getting?My partner and I look at each other and start a game of anxiety chicken or trying to communicate to one another ‚ÄúI really want a cat, Tiger seems amazing let‚Äôs still take her‚Äù We leave and immediately confirm, that‚Äôs not who we were expecting. \\nSo we took the wrong cat home. Turns out that Zebra was not adoptable at the time we met her. My perception of her was not incorrect we just never confirmed that she was the kitty in the picture!!!\\nWell I‚Äôve had Tiger home for a couple days and I can confirm that emotionally, I absolutely did not take the wrong cat home. She is my best friend and I am in love with her. I just want to spoil this beautiful baby forever! (I can tell that she was meant to me mine from the transition anxiety poops/farts, my anxiety manifests the same)\\n\\nTL;DR: I didn‚Äôt confirm that the cat I saw in the profile was the cat I was petting; best fuck up ever. \\n\\nEdit to add that I posted a picture in the comments! I was unaware of the cat tax! ',\n",
       " \"TIFU by not using my brain, and almost losing my Instagram account  - Like the title says, my brain just wasn't working today. (Also, posting this to spread awareness just in case this happens to anyone else).\\n\\nI was checking my Instagram feed, as you do, when I get a message from one of my bandmates asking me for a favor. I barely know them, but I recognized them as one of my bandmates, so I replied. This person, pretending to be my bandmate, decided to bait me by requesting a code to access their Instagram account.\\n\\nPart of me thought this was weird, but the logic processing part of my brain hadn't kicked in yet (for context, I'm autistic. This results in a myriad of holes in my social iq. What's relevant to this tifu story, is that my brain sometimes takes longer to process information, hence why some of these red flags took a while to go off in my brain). I then proceeded to give this person a code to my account (stupid ik, but that's what this post is for)\\n\\nAs soon as the red flags started to finally process in my head, I reached out individually to this bandmate via BAND to ask them if it was really them. That's when they confirmed that I'd been had. Before I knew it, I was booted out of my own Instagram account, the link to my Facebook account and phone number was undone, and for a whole 2-ish hours, my Instagram account was no longer mine.\\n\\nCue an autism meltdown. For those who don't know what a meltdown is like, it isn't fun. At least for me, my brain just starts spiraling out of control. No matter what I do, my brain just can't get out of what's bothering me in that moment. Furthermore, all of my thoughts and feelings come out in forms of yelling, crying, and rage fits. It's not pretty, ik, but having friends nearby helps.\\n\\nEventually, a couple sorority sisters managed to help calm me down, and I managed to get to the screen that this douchebag baited me in with. Instagram had me contact two friends to verify my account so I could reset my password (my mom and one of the aforementioned sorority sisters were who confirmed my account), and what do you know, my account is mine again. As soon as I got my account back, I immediately took precautions to hopefully prevent this whole debacle from happening again.\\n\\nHonestly, this is something that I wouldn't wish on anybody, and I'm so lucky that I managed to get my account back. If someone randomly messages you for a favor when you weren't expecting it, and asks you to send over stuff from your email, please don't give them anything.\\n\\nTldr: I fell for a hackers bait, and I nearly lost my Instagram account in the process. \",\n",

He has been off and on teething since August. He now has 7 teeth. Sometimes, he comes over to me or my husband (27m) and will bite (or try to bite) my (covered with a blanket) knee, leg, toes, or more recently, an arm. For the past couple days, I‚Äôve been brushing it off, thinking it‚Äôs just a part of him teething, seeing as that‚Äôs something he‚Äôs definitely done these past couple of months. When he‚Äôs teething, he just acts like he desperately needs something to gnaw on it have in his mouth. \\n\\nHowever, something that my family has done growing up, and I know this may sound weird, is we playfully tickle or bite each other (like in the sides or feet usually). It‚Äôs something my parents would playfully do to us as little kids, and it‚Äôs something my mom and I both do to my son (ex: snatch him up and pretend to eat him, please tell me someone else knows what I‚Äôm talking about lol). \\nThese past couple of days, it seems like when my son bites does it more in a purposeful way, making me think he‚Äôs doing it to play. He just doesn‚Äôt know how to not bite like he‚Äôs actually eating! \\n\\nTL; DR So, today I messed up by realizing it‚Äôs my fault he bites and I‚Äôm not sure how to go about it üòÖ. On one hand, it‚Äôs been a very fun way to play with him ‚Äî he loves being wrestled and roughhoused. On the other hand, going up to someone and biting them out of nowhere is something one of my brothers used to do when he was like 4 and I know that is probably not behavior to be encouraged.',\n",

She went to my bathroom to borrow my moisturizer and she found my pregnancy test right on the counter. She ran downstairs holding the test and quickly asking me if it‚Äôs true. My son overheard the whole thing and wanted my answer so bad. I told them it was true and my daughter started looking very stressed. She told me it was because she didn‚Äôt want to look after a baby. I really get her because I had a sibling 13 years younger than me that me and my siblings spent most of our time looking after. \\n\\nI hugged both of them and told them it was going to me okay. I really didn‚Äôt want my kids to find out before my husband came home, but it happened anyway.\\n\\nTL;DR: My kids found out I‚Äôm pregnant from me leaving my test on the counter and they‚Äôre worried about it now. Me and my husband are happy about this ourselves and have assured our kids that it‚Äôll be alright',\n",

Between all the dancing, party favors, and other shenanigans, my body went through a lot. \\n\\nThis morning we had our usual intercourse (missionary mostly).

Safety first.\\n\\nFast forward to later in the day, I text my (female) coworker what I thought was a hilarious meme and put my phone down.

I struggle with one individual, Vikram, because he is rude to women in our meetings and I quite frankly I just don‚Äôt like him.  I joined the meeting from my desk which is in an open office and not in the conference room, that was my first screw up.\\n\\nIn all of our past meetings he constantly talks over top of people and repeats himself, asking the same questions or making the same statements over and over.  During this meeting, he wouldn‚Äôt stop talking over top of me and another coworker who were trying to explain what we were working on.  I had finally reached my limit and told him to stop talking so that we could finish our explanation.\\n\\nHe didn‚Äôt stop, so I asked my female coworkers to leave the meeting then proceeded to chew him out.  I didn‚Äôt raise my voice, but I was talking with what my kids would call my mean dad voice, which is low, firm and very direct.  Second screw up.  Like I said, I am in an open office.  I have people all around me.  My manager, ‚ÄúVijay‚Äù who is a director, and the manager above him, ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù who is an executive, are within 20‚Äô of my desk and overheard what I was saying.  I told Vikram to shut his mouth and open his ears while I explain the process.  He then yelled over top of me ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt tell me to shut up‚Äù and I proceeded by saying, ‚ÄúI just did.  Now shut up and listen so I don‚Äôt have to repeat myself again.‚Äù\\n\\nSomewhere in the middle of my comments I said that he was acting like a child and if he wanted me to treat him like a toddler I would.  Third screw up.  After that comment he kept quiet, but I could see the door to Vijay‚Äôs office close and Joe was in his office asking what the hell was going on with me.  I have worked with these two in various roles for many, many years and they know I don‚Äôt ever talk like this to anyone.  I finished my explanation of the process we were developing and our current status, then asked if he had any questions.  Before allowing him to respond I said that if history was any indication I lost him about 3 sentences into my explanation, so I needed to know where I lost him.  He said he didn‚Äôt have any questions and immediately left the meeting.\\n\\nVijay and Joe were still in Vijay‚Äôs office with the door closed when I went to check on Annie, one of my female coworkers who had stayed in the meeting.  This guy has been known to back her into conference rooms and berate her about her part of the project.  She is more than half his age and a recent hire in our company.  By the time I got to her desk, Vikram came storming out of the conference room looking for Joe.  He pulled Joe into the conference room and proceeded to unload everything that had taken place.  As per his normal behavior he talked over top of Joe, I could hear most of what was being said.  He wasn‚Äôt too terribly off on his story of what happened.\\n\\nI met with Vijay for my regular one on one later in the day.  He told me I was out of line and I should never have called Vikram a toddler.  He went on to say I should have joined the meeting in the conference room and going forward I am not allowed to join Vikram‚Äôs meeting from my desk.  \\n\\nMy take away is that since I was in an open office and several people overheard me chewing Vikram out, that was the problem.  If I had been in a private conference room I wouldn‚Äôt be in trouble.  I have been asked to apologize - a genuine apology.  The problem for me is I‚Äôm not sorry for what I said or for how the message was delivered.  He had it coming for a long time.  Now, for the first time in my nearly 30 year career I have been put on an ‚Äúimprovement plan‚Äù.  \\n\\nTL;DR I chewed out a coworker in a meeting while I was sitting in an open office and told him he was acting like a toddler.',\n",

Things were going pretty great, we had very similar values, life goals and outlooks. Even had some obscure similarities in food, movies and music. \\n\\nAt one point we were sharing our sense of humor and she hesitantly brought up dark humor. I am totally into that so I encouraged her to share a joke. The day we were having this phone call happened to be 9/11 so she hit me with a 9/11 joke. I thought it was pretty funny and we laughed together. We both agreed that jokes like this aren\\'t meant to belittle the tragedy but rather share a bit of laughter and comfort around the subject.   \\nShe then recommended I watch a stand up special by Daniel Sloss called Jigsaw. Great stand up, by the way, go watch it. The first ten minutes was basically talking about voluntary child abuse. \\n\\nThis is where I fucked up. Fast forward a week, things are still going great and I heard a pretty dark joke that I found funny. So I decided to send it over to her, thinking she was also into dark and messed up humor like I was. \\n\\nThe joke was: \"This guy went to a paraplegic strip club the other night. The place was crawling with pussy.\" \\n\\nWell, following that joke I didn\\'t get a response for two days and then when I asked if it was too dark she just replied she didn\\'t like it.

Julian and i have been talking more and we have finally gotten past the cusp of awkward exs and started becoming friends again around a month ago. This week specifically broke my heart... 4 days ago i get a tezt feom him which was a surprise since i normally reach out first so i immediatly responded. We began talking and it quickly became a non stop rush of questions, reminiscing, and random conversations for 3 days straight. We didnt talk for about 4 hours yesterday and he asked me if i had eaten, which made me tear up quite a bit cuz he only dis that when we dated.. anywho to tge dream last night. I  had trouble sleeping so i texted our mutual friend cole to talk to him about how he was and how julian and i, i think, are getting closer again but i wont have false hope. Cole continued to comment on how cute our conversations were and how he was happy to see julian and i getting closer again. I began to tear up and stopped answering as quickly which prompted cole to call me.out of concern i guess. I immediatly started sobbing and explain that i just want julian to love me like he used to which i knew was selfish and col conforted me through it and even said that i wont know until life shows me that were meant to be in the future. After a couple hours on the phone i fell asleep. This is where the problem starts. I had a dream about me and julian as an older couple with children and grandchildren around a christmas tree...i know this seems childish but the fact that i woke up crying made me realize that i have no idea what to do with myself....i was hoping the internet people couls thats why im writing this. I was in a different state for a school trip last night but that dream hurt me ao bad that i immediatly started driving 7 hours home and came home to talk to my mom. I sat there unable to even talk for about an hoyr before my mom spoke up. The second she spoke i broke down in sikent tears and asked my mom to hold me like i was 5 again. I havent cried tgat loud and hard since my childhood dog died last year in september.... i realize now that i either have to stop talking to him to geal myself but i cant...i mean i cant but...god i dont knoq what to do...can you talk some sense into me? \\n\\nEdit: we had a short conversation. I asked him the full reason as to why we broke up and all he could say other than his parents and me not knowing how to process love was \" i dont f***in know i forgot...drank and smoked it all away low key\"...ive been on read since i apologized...ig this TIFU has gotten worse.\\n\\nTL;DR TIFU by having a dream about my ex and realizing im falling in love with him again.\\n',\n",
       " 'TIFU by almost revealing I started writing my vows - My (29F) boyfriend \"Alex\" (28M) have been together for 3 years and living together for over 2. We both agree on and plan to get married, but we want to be more financially stable first. We\\'ve never had a fight, just a few very calm disagreements and our communication is great 99.9% of the time. This is all to establish that as far as I can tell we have a very healthy relationship and I\\'m not totally crazy for doing this.\\n\\nI have a tendency to plan out things that I want to say in my head, but have a terrible memory, so I write them down. I\\'m also one of those people who always dreamed of getting married. I was single for a lot of my young adult life and had started to be convinced it would never happen. Then I met Alex and was absolutely blown away by happiness. I\\'ve never known love like this and we\\'ve weathered a few complex life events with no problems. My friends and family love him, his friends and family love me, aside from normal life chaos things are great. \\n\\nNow to the meat of the story.\\nA month or so ago I couldn\\'t sleep and my brain had already been in the mode of \"I wonder what our wedding would look like?\" (which isn\\'t super common but happens). I then thought down the path of what I would say for vows. To be fair, I\\'ve been to a handful of weddings but never closely studied the vows so I\\'m not even 100% sure what I came up with will work, but my brain generated something that sounded like the perfect little speech before leading into the \"I promise to...\" Part. I\\'m not a writer and usually don\\'t come up with things that pretty so I wrote it down in my notes app. \\n\\nFast forward to last night.\\nAlex was at a concert with friends. I had plans to meet up with one of my best friends, \"Jess\". They\\'re also in a happy long term relationship and have also been thinking about wedding stuff in general. While talking I without thinking said something along the lines of \"I even kind of started writing my vows so...\". They freaked out and of course wanted to read what I had, and I know they wouldn\\'t tell Alex, so I showed them. Jess of course started crying saying they loved it. The conversation continued, I went home, and Alex got home from his concert too.\\n\\nHere\\'s where I went wrong. \\nI\\'m terrible with secrets and lies. Ever since I was a kid and had a lie bite me in the ass I just don\\'t. I\\'ve found life to be better when open and honest. \\nAlex is also friends with Jess and asked how our hangout was. I started to say \"great but I made them cry\" and cut myself after \"but I\" upon realizing what he would ask next and I don\\'t want to lie to him. He obviously realized I had a secret and started playing 20 questions to find out what it was. Like I said I\\'m horrible with secrets and he managed to figure out that it\\'s some sort of gift but that he won\\'t get it for possibly years. It\\'s worth noting that he HATES both gifts and surprises, they make him anxious, uncomfortable, and feeling indebted. This is when I knew I messed up, because once he knew something existed, I knew he would dwell on it indefinitely and it would bother him. Yes I could have lied and said it was something about Jess and their partner but I was also anxious at that point and picked the wrong cover up. \\n\\nAfter apologizing for knowing that I\\'ve created a train of thought that will bug him, and trying to convince him that he would be best off forgetting I said anything, we went to bed. He said he had a dream about solving a puzzle, and throughout the day has been texting me probing questions trying to figure it out. I am obviously not going to reveal any more, and I certainly won\\'t be showing him what I wrote, but I feel bad that this will genuinely bother him for a while. \\n\\nAlso to anyone thinking \"just tell him something but don\\'t reveal it all\", that might make things worse. We both fully plan to get married but it\\'s not really on our radar anytime soon, and I know he has a lot of anxiety about \"not feeling enough like a grown adult\" especially when it comes to marriage. I should add that we both have stable careers and he is the most emotionally intelligent man I\\'ve ever met, so other than saving money and him feeling comfortable with the idea, I don\\'t think there are actually any roadblocks. I\\'m in no rush whatsoever and will happily wait until he is as enthusiastic about it as I am. If I was to reveal that it had anything to do with our future vows it might make his anxiety worse. He doesn\\'t mind talking about it, weddings are a common topic with many of our friends getting married, but it\\'s not something he thought about prior to our relationship so discussing little details for our own wedding stresses him out a little, his brain just hasn\\'t thought that far yet. I don\\'t want to give him even the slightest idea that I\\'m trying to rush him, when in reality I\\'m just living the dream of my inner little girl thinking about her future wedding.\\n\\nTLDR:\\nIn the midst of a happy long term relationship I randomly thought up part of what I might want to say for my vows at our eventual wedding. My boyfriend hates surprises, and I accidentally revealed that I have a secret after I showed what I wrote to a friend. He is now going to drive himself crazy trying to figure out what it is, which I obviously will not confirm even if he does figure it out. I feel guilty for giving him an unsolvable puzzle that he will dwell on ',\n",
       " 'TIFU by shaving myself  - For context I\\'m a very hairy man and have been a bit insecure about my body. I also have a tendency to involuntary twitch. I don\\'t think it\\'s tourette\\'s but I\\'ve never been tested for it. Anyway I\\'ve been reading online that some men feel more confident after manscaping their \"netherregions\". So I think you all see where this is going. Ive been shaving and trimming my beard with a beard trimmer that I also use to shave my head when my hair gets too long. I thought to myself \"well if it works for my hair and beard I don\\'t see why it wouldn\\'t work for what I\\'ve got going on \\'down under\\'\". So I take a pair of trimming scissors I use for my beard and was being EXTREMELY careful when cutting the hair length down so it\\'s easier to shave it off. After I was done I used my electric trimmer. Welp my body decided \"this seems like the perfect time to twitch\". And I ended up accidentally cutting my \"hotdog\". Thankfully i didn\\'t hit a vein. But was left with a stinging pain. Needless to say I\\'m gonna buy the proper tools for the next time I decide to trim the hair downstairs. \\n\\nTL;DR I tried to shave around my groined area and ended up accidentally cutting my \"member\".

       " 'TIFU by mishearing someone and embarrassing myself - So I\\'m currently on a trip to Spain, staying in a hostel.\\n\\nI was in the shared kitchen on the first night, and wanted to make a cup of tea, but some guy was using the kettle. No issues.\\n\\nMe: \"Can I use the kettle when you\\'re done?\"\\n\\nHim: \"Why\"\\n\\nMe: \"Uh, I\\'m just looking to make some tea\"\\n\\nHim, annoyed: \"Why\"\\n\\nMe: \"... I just feel like making a cup of tea, what\\'s the issue\"\\n\\nHe turns to me, clearly very irritated, and says the word again, more enunciated, at which point I realise he wasn\\'t saying \\'why\\', he was saying \\'wait\\' in a very strong accent.\\n\\nAt this point a group of people standing nearby are staring at us. One is amused, one is giving me a dirty look, while a third is rolling her eyes. I realise I\\'m looking like a Karen.\\n\\nI go red and try to explain that I just misheard the guy but before I could get enough words out he cuts me off really angrily, and one of the girls from the group goes \\'leave him alone and have some patience, he will be done soon\\'.\\n\\nSo anyway I walked away embarrassed, didn\\'t get my tea, and am seriously considering just booking a whole new hostel.\\n\\nTL;DR I repeatedly misheard a guy and looked like an obnoxious Karen',\n",
       " 'TIFU - Made out with married good friend - I‚Äôve (24F) worked alongside a male coworker (32M) for a few years now, we have a great friendship and connection. He is married with a daughter who he adores, however doesn‚Äôt have a good relationship with his wife. He isn‚Äôt happy. He is openly bisexual, and in my mind I‚Äôve always thought he preferred men, so I have always felt really comfortable with him and been affectionate with him. He has never made me feel remotely uncomfortable, we are both affectionate people so we will hug, happy to link arms, hold hands for emotional support. If I need a minute I will put my head of his shoulder, it comes naturally. We will have ‚Äúflirty‚Äù conversations sometimes with others, but nothing directly sex related. I recently left my job so we no longer work together or see each other everyday.\\n\\nOn the weekend we were out drinking with friends, we were both intoxicated and had been holding hands crazy dancing on the dance floor. We went out side to the smoking area alone, on the way there he stopped and faced me and put his forehead on mine and said ‚ÄúI really want to kiss you right now‚Äù and he kissed me really gently. \\nI pulled away sort of in shock more than anything and we went outside away from people. He held my hands and talked about how much I meant to him and he loves me and wishes we had met earlier in life. He was apologetic and said he didn‚Äôt want to make me uncomfortable at all. We kept kissing and then we were making out. I really enjoyed it but I pulled away at times and put my head on his chest and said that we couldn‚Äôt door this (married remember). He said he knows and just wanted to have tonight. We kept kissing and he literally made me feel like the only girl in the world. we briefly spoke about implementing boundaries as we don‚Äôt want to loose each other or our friendship. (Still tbc) We caught a cab back to our respective homes after.\\nI love him as a friend and loved kissing him so now things feel a bit different. I really want to kiss him again. We will catch up at an event in about two weeks. Being in shock that night I didn‚Äôt get to really know what I was thinking and feeling. But now I feel I can‚Äôt stay away. \\nIn my background I have been taken advantage of by men in the past so this was my first intimate interaction with a man as an adult and that felt safe.\\n\\nTLDR: I made out with a male good friend of mine and feelings were shared. I felt safe and enjoyed it and want to kiss him again\\n\\nUPDATE: Even though I enjoyed it and want to - I have absolutely no intention of kissing him again. I know it‚Äôs wrong of me, hence why I don‚Äôt want to. I will see him again soon, yes, but he will be at work and I will be a guest. ',\n",
       " 'TIFU by oversharing with a customer  - My mom and I were returning from a trip this past weekend and she had been coughing quite a bit during the 7 hour drives. She had just come back from a theme park the week before, so it was safe to assume she caught something out there.\\n\\nAs a precaution, I gave her a Covid test last night and found it was positive. At this point though, we had all been vaccinated and boosted at least 2 times each, so the next day, we masked up and went about our business. We‚Äôre in the process of moving and the new house still needs a lot of work. I went to my job for a quick shift. \\n\\nMy throat was starting to become sore, but I figured that with a day off the next day, if I was to get any worse, I‚Äôd have a whole day to be REALLY sick and could make the call if I couldn‚Äôt come in afterwards. But aside from the sore throat, I was fine. I wore a tight mask and used my personal bottle of sanitizer more frequently.\\n\\nA customer tried to call in an order over the phone twice. The first time, my co-worker answered and transferred her to the kitchen. We‚Äôre at the lull in our staffing, between the lunch rush and dinner rush, so servers were scarce. As a result, the call bounced back to the front where I answered. She explained that she wanted to place an order, come into the store to pay and then leave. No problem, my co-worker just forgot to radio the kitchen that there was a call on hold. I transfer her again and this time I tell the kitchen to answer.\\n\\nA few minutes pass and a lady walks in, masked up. Not an uncommon sight in my store, but still somewhat rare. She wants to place a to-go order with a server, explaining that she tried to call in twice, but was never answered. Great, it‚Äôs the same lady. Our call-ins are supposed to go through a third party, but for some reason, some calls come through to us and transferring them to the kitchen is hit or miss. Frustrating, but again, no problem. I call up a server and her order finally gets taken.\\n\\nShe toils around the store for a bit, grabbing a few packs of jelly beans. Employee protocol calls for us to hand customers baskets to encourage them to shop more. I walk up to her with a hand basket and politely offer it to her. She thanks me and drops her candies in. I walk away to go back to my register duties.\\n\\nA few minutes later, she walks up to me and asks if I was okay. And this was where my fuck up happened. I have a bad habit of over sharing at work. Not gross out over sharing or secret-spilling, moreso familial gossip. Still no one‚Äôs business. But in my head, Covid is no longer the Plague it used to be. You mask up, wash your hands frequently and only stay home if you‚Äôre really sick. Having to isolate for a week is not something you‚Äôre required to do anymore, so in my head, I was not nearly as contagious as I could‚Äôve been if I wasn‚Äôt wearing my mask and also very sick.\\n\\nSo I told her my Mother was positive, but I was having mild symptoms.\\n\\n‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre saying you were exposed?! I can‚Äôt be near you!!‚Äù\\n\\nThe next thing I knew, this lady dove into the dining room, placed her hand basket (which we keep on the floors) on a table and raised a stink to my managers. I was called into the office and appropriately reprimanded for over sharing.\\n\\nOn the somewhat bright side though, my managers reassured me that this particular customer was infamous for raising a stink about germs. She would frequently place curbside orders and then demand the servers who brought out her food to take her money so she wouldn‚Äôt have to step into the store to pay. She even freaked out when my co-worker touched his face.\\n\\nThe managers cancelled her to-go and walked with me to the front of the store where we watched the lady go out to her car, rub hand sanitizer onto her hair, wrap herself in a fitted sheet and get into her car to drive away. My managers were joking amongst each other over the ridiculousness, but I refused to mock her because this was my fault. That lady was dealing with a mental health crisis and I made it worse by opening my big mouth.\\n\\nTL;DR\\nMy gossipy ass told a customer I was exposed to Covid and she appropriately flipped out',\n",
       " 'TIFU by cancelling 5 hours before my date due to a cold sore. - In order to truly express my FU I need to give some context.\\n\\nIn August 2022, I went into a coffee shop I\\'ve never been to which is where I met this girl. She works there as a barista and there is a bar top that pretty much faces their workstation. I sat at the bar top and she immediately starts conversing with me. I think she\\'s just being kind but I enjoy our conversation. \\n\\nSince then, I have been going to this coffee shop every weekend and we always end up talking. Now, before people say I\\'m being creepy, I\\'d like to mention that after the first few weeks, I got a surprise follow request from her on Instagram. I did not give her my info although I\\'m not hard to find because I have a unique first name. Safe to say she enjoyed our conversations just as much as I did.\\n\\nAnyways, I found out early that she has a BF she is in a long distance relationship with. He works in a different state while she is still in school. Still, at this point even though I knew there was no chance at dating her, I still enjoyed our conversations. \\n\\nFast forward to April 2024. She has graduated college and quit working at the coffee shop. With that, I also stopped going. I never saw her or talked to her again. The only connection we had now was through Instagram where time to time she would like my stories and I would like hers but nothing more.\\n\\nAnother thing to note is that during the time I got to know her, she told me she did not want to live in the state her BF lives in and that she wants to stay in our current state. So I knew that when she graduates , either her BF would move back or they would break up.\\n\\nSo over the summer, every few weeks I would check her insta to see if she still had pics of her BF posted. Its now September 2024, I go to check her profile and no more BF pics.\\n\\nI\\'m excited and nervous. I\\'m thinking all week if I should just DM her and ask her out. Then, on Sunday Sept 15th, I GET A HINGE LIKE FROM HER.\\n\\nTo my own fault, I got overly excited. Not only was this a girl I was super into but the fact that it was someone I knew prior and IRL made this situation so much better. I can\\'t remember the last time I went on a date with a girl that I didn\\'t know anything about prior to hinge. \\n\\nIt\\'s also worth noting that over the last couple years i\\'ve more or less given up on online dating. I just have not had any genuine connections and every first date feels like the same.\\n\\nSo, yeah, I\\'m just too excited. Already thinking about our future together. Too much of that, which is not something I ever really do.\\n\\nSo i match and message her on Monday. Say \\'hey its been a while\\' , \\'how are you\\' etc...she responds immediately and then follows up asking for my number so we can swtich to texting (wow she\\'s really into me).\\n\\nShe texts me saying she wants to catch up and I ask if she wants to go out for drinks Friday night so we can catch up in person. She says yes.\\n\\nSo there are mixed opinions of what to do when date night is a few nights away. I try to do minimal messaging of \\'hey how does 8pm her sound\\' one night then maybe the next day say \\'hey just want to check if were still on for tomorrow\\'. I don\\'t want to message too much because I want to have conversations in person.\\n\\nWell she messages me saying \"I know we\\'re supposed to catch up Friday but I can\\'t wait lol. I want to hear about your new job!\" (WOW she\\'s really into me!)\\n\\nSo we are message pretty heavy back and forth. She is hearting all my messages. It feels like a true love story. Romance is in the air. My heart is beating, I\\'m smiling, I\\'m just so happy that this opportunity has come. I\\'m on cloud 9.\\n\\nThe Wednesday morning I woke up to a cold sore (FML FML). I immediately applied treatment. All day I\\'m applying treatment to minimize its visibility. Though i prevented it from getting huge, there are still blisters and its noticeable. Thursday is same case. I\\'m applying treatment all day, looking in the mirror every 20 minutes wondering if I need to re-schedule or if it\\'ll get better. I really really did not want to cancel and just prayed it would be good enough by Friday. \\n\\nIts Friday morning. It\\'s improved but still noticeable. Enough that i\\'m still checking myself out in the mirror every 20 minutes debating if I can see her like this. I\\'m really trying to hold out hoping its good.\\n\\nIts Friday at 3pm. 5 hours before date night. I realize too late that I can\\'t be seen like this. It\\'s probably more in my  head than realistically but I made the decision to text her asking to re-schedule. I wanted to be honest but cold sores are something I\\'m pretty self conscious about and I just felt scared that it would be a major turn off telling her that. So i told her I had a migraine and that I don\\'t see it getting better anytime soon so I want to re-schedule. Ironically, it seems the real turn off was cancelling a few hours before. And looking back, migraine sounds like such a dumb excuse.\\n\\nShe doesn\\'t respond on Friday.  \\nSaturday morning I send a follow up text telling her how sorry I am. She immedieatly responds and says its no problem. These things happen. She says shes busy all weekend but that we can find time to reschedule again later. I ask if she\\'s free weeknights and would like to meet Monday night. No response rest of Saturday. No response Sunday. Over the weekend i\\'m checking Hinge to see if she\\'s made any changes to her profile(nope). On Monday no response. I check her Hinge profile again that night and she unmatched me. \\n\\nAt this point my heart has sunken. I feel like the universe dangled happiness in my face and pulled the rug out from under me. I feel like I\\'ve been kicked to the ground. I feel as if every bit of hope and happiness has escaped me. I haven\\'t been able to sleep. I can\\'t stop thinking about this. I\\'m constantly looking at my phone screen hoping to receive a text I will probably never receive. I am looking upwards to god every hour swearing at the top of my lungs at how un-fucking-believable this timing could have been. To finally get my opportunity for a date with her and a cold sore in the same week! FML! It is 100% my fault for getting too excited about this too early because the disappointment has crashed down so hard on me. I think its hurting because this girl knew me IRL. She was into me. I had already attracted her and then I fucking blew it up. To go from texting everyday to absolute silence. It fucking hurts.\\n\\nIt\\'s Tuesday. I just sent her another message this morning asking how her weekend was but I think its over.\\n\\nTL;DR: Had a date planned with an amazing girl I\\'ve been into for over a year. Got blessed with a cold sore and had to cancel. Tried to reschedule and  haven\\'t heard from her since.',\n",
       " \"TIFU by Infecting the Workplace with COVID - Last week, my mother had my cousins down to the house to stay. I wasn't entirely excited about this as it was going to be an extremely hectic two weeks for me at work. I was retroactively denied time off due to understandable circumstances, and my workload was about to triple, but I had it in writing that I was likely going to get the newly available supervisor role with this trial period went great. Massive pay bump too.\\n\\nWhat this meant was I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to see my gaming cousins much, which was an absolute bummer, but I still had some evenings we could talk. At least, I thought that was going to be the case. Anytime I got home after work, they were in the spare room together gaming with each other on their Switches. I was able to join in on their LAN games, but they never once left the room unless it was for the bathroom or something.\\n\\nI never asked anyone why they kept to the room. It just didn‚Äôt cross me. In my house, when the door is closed, they want privacy. Admittedly, I was a little disappointed, as I was under the understanding they were into board games and was hoping to play some Settlers or 7 Wonders with them. Since my brother moved out and my friends across the country, I‚Äôve been a bit starved for board gaming.\\n\\nThis went on for the whole week, the only time I saw them was when they went to the Bathroom we shared. (IMPORTANT)\\n\\nFriday at work was an extremely busy day trying to get everything done before the weekend. I was rushing between everyone making sure things kept going, and my adrenaline was extremely high. I didn‚Äôt even register that anything was wrong until I got home that evening and absolutely crashed.\\n\\nI felt weak, dizzy, my strength absolutely sapped. As a result, I didn‚Äôt even talk to my parents, I just called it an early night and went to bed.\\n\\nI was feeling absolutely horrible Saturday, fever, headache, upset stomach, and the water I took with my medication tasted like a Switch Gaming Cartridge. I was sick. I went downstairs to get something light to eat, and my dad pushed one of the COVID test kits into my hands. That's when the shoe dropped.\\n\\nThe reason why my cousins were not leaving the spare room was because they were quarantining themselves. They caught COVID from a wedding they went to five days before they came to visit, and no one bothered to inform me. Hell, I am kicking myself that I didn't realize it out sooner. Worst off, I was sharing a bathroom with them while my parents were using the downstairs bathroom. I didn‚Äôt ask, no one told me. It just completely slipped my mind.\\n\\nOf course I had it and the next three days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) was hell on Earth. Despite having all my shots up to date to say it was the worst I felt ever would be an understatement. It could have been a lot worse, but today, Tuesday, I felt good enough to return to work with proper precautions in place to ensure it would not spread‚Ä¶\\n\\nBut it was too late.\\n\\nRemember when I said that Friday I was rushing between everyone to make sure things kept running. This involved handling things, passing it to others, talking to others, and ensuring quality of prints. Where I live, COVID Regulations are not mandatory, it's basically ‚ÄúUse common sense, if you have it, wear a mask, clean up your area, don‚Äôt be an idiot.‚Äù Now we can add ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be an uninformed MORON‚Äù to that list.\\n\\nIt started with two people calling in sick. Then, one by one my team started feeling sick and ill. Some were more resistant and able to continue working, but a lot just asked to leave early. Someone used one of the tests provided by the company, and yep, they have it. Not just them, but after they were confirmed the rest of the team took the test and everyone save for the one person I don‚Äôt interact with caught it (and I don't think thats going to last long). Because the one person I don‚Äôt interact with was the only one who didn‚Äôt catch it, it was easily traced back to me as Patient Zero.\\n\\nMy boss said he is going to stick up for me, argueing their should be no disciplinary actions against me for being careless or not adhering to due diligence. I was genuinely uninformed, and the moment I learned I emailed my boss to do a wipe down of the facility, but it was too late. Right now I am sitting in an empty print shop, three quarters of my team missing, still have a headache, and brainstorming with my boss about how we are going to get out of this mess.\\n\\nRight now the only thing that has been set in stone is Face Masks and Hourly Wipe downs are coming back into effect, which the team is just going to absolutely love but won't help right now.\\n\\nI don‚Äôt think I am going to get that Supervisor position. I am sure my direct boss will stand up and fight for me, but an entire facility shutting down from me, that‚Äôs going to be hard to ignore.\\n\\ntl:dr Read the F'ing room. If it looks like a quaratine and squawks like a quaratine, take precautions and ask questions.\",\n",
       " 'TIFU: By trusting the Eyewear salesperson - I knew something was wrong. \\n\\nI had a good eye appointment as usual and then went to buy my glasses. The place I go is usually more expensive, so I expected it to be more. Like last time, I picked out a frame that would be covered by my insurance. The salesperson pulls up my info and says \"you got anti-reflective, scratch coating, and single vision last time, do you want what you got last time?\" I said, yes. I didn\\'t really remember what I got. Then, after a while, I get told the total. I wasn\\'t asked anything else. The total was nearly $300. Last time, I didn\\'t pay that much and I asked if all my insurance got applied. I was told yes and your paying for the anti-coating. I asked once more and was told it\\'s correct.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t remember, so I figured must be right. The price just seemed wrong to me. I have to pay before seeing the charges or getting the reciept. I pay, get a sheet about a warranty, and then I see a warranty in addition to the other charges. I was never asked about a warranty. \\n\\nI don\\'t know why, but I didn\\'t check until after in my account how much I paid last year ($110) and I knew I had the files from last year. I check it, last year my anti-coating was a different type (which is covered) and I didn\\'t get a warranty. I knew I should have pushed back more and refused payment, or at least looked at my old account. I never get warranties for stuff like this, knew it wasnt like me. Welp, I\\'m out that money now. Next time, I\\'m taking the old sheet with me and requesting exactly that. This is why eyewear sales and anything with the dentist feels like a scam (cause it really is). \\n\\nTLDR: Today I fucked up by trusting the eyewear  salesperson to give me what I got last time.

We added a twist where for each race a person loses, they must remove one article of clothing. What ended up ensuing was multiple competitive rounds, but in the end I won. From there things escalated very quickly and progressed from making out, to both our clothes coming off, eventually reaching the point of us having sex.\\n\\n\\nHere‚Äôs where the fuck up of the fuck down comes in: In the middle of it things were rough and heavy, and she starts to say her lips are getting itchy, and while this is happening I can see her breasts, thighs, and many other parts start to turn red.\\n\\nWe stop and she asks me if the dinner we had, had any sort of seafood in it, and that she has a severe allergy to fish.

I rushed outside the crowd (because of adrenaline) and fell as soon as I passed the crowd. A guy(fresher) helped me check both my legs out and brought my chair so I could sit properly with my legs well-rested; halfway through the checking, my friends also came to help me. They called the security guards so we could call for an ambulance to the medical center (I could not walk). We had to fucking wait for the ambulance for 20 mins while it was just inside my campus. Till then, I informed my father about it; he got worried and scolded me for dancing/jumping and said that I was too careless (but I told him to chill down a bit). When I was in the medical center, the doctor said it was just a sprain(both the ankles), but he would need to examine it tomorrow (that being today). I came back and told him everything; he then told my mom when I went to sleep (my mom resides in a different country). I slept a lot and missed one of the meds prescription that was given by the doctor the night before. \\n\\n\\n\\nNow, I woke up and called my mom.

       " \"TIFU by taking the wrong magnesium supplement for decades - My husband recently went to the doctor for routine blood work/checkup and the doctor suggested a magnesium supplement to help him get to sleep at night. I thought, great! We have magnesium, I've been taking it for years. Husband points out that the doctors specified magnesium glycinate. We have magnesium oxide. Didn't think much if it other than the doctor had mentioned less stomach upset with the glycinate. We promptly got busy and I forgot to order the supplement until last night. \\n\\nA little history, I've been taking magnesium since I was a teenager on and off. I have chronic anxiety. Back then, we called them my happy pills, and it's possible that they were actually the glycinate because they seemed to help my mood. But once I was out in my own I either didn't take them, or just went to the drug store and bought whatever supplement was available. Generally the Natures Best Magnesium, which as verified last night is magnesium oxide. I go through phases where I take it, and have taken it based on doctor's recommendation even, but I have never noticed any improvement in mood. This last go around, the only benefit I noticed was that if I took two it would clear up some constipation with some diarrhea.\\n\\nAs we were laying in bed last night, hubby asked if I ever ordered his magnesium and as I hadn't we went down the rabbit hole of trying to remember which specific magnesium we needed and I got curious, so googled the difference between oxide and glycinate. The first response was that oxide is used to treat things like constipation and glycinate is used for things like anxiety and sleep. Anxiety and sleep is what I've always been told, yet have not in almost two decades felt the result of.\\n\\nTwo decades of shitty sleep that led eventually to a sleep specialist that told me I'm perfectly fine. At least 15 years of trying to manage anxiety with various meds and doctor visits, weekly therapy, and finally most recently after a panic attack that put me in the ER, a psychiatrist. I'm not saying that taking the right supplement would have changed any of that, but I have spent the last two decades thinking magnesium just doesn't do anything for me. When it turns out I've been taking the wrong supplement the whole time. \\n\\nAnd as icing on the cake, as I went down my google rabbit hole last night, I ended up on a reddit thread what when I exited out of left me on my reddit home page on my phone, to be immediately informed that an iconic musician in our community was tragically killed in a horrible motorcycle accident. Something I would have learned eventually, but really didn't need to find out as I was trying to go to sleep. Just because I'd put my book down to google magnesium. \\n\\nTL:DR Googled the magnesium supplement my husband's doctor recommended only to learn I've been taking wrong type for decades, equalling no improvement in anxiety but an increase of diarrhea. Then as a result of the googling learned an iconic musician in our community died. Went to bed very sad. \",\n",

He was funny, had a good taste in movies and films. Only issue was he didn‚Äôt reply me on time and i confronted him once or twice about it but he explained that he is not much of a texter(?) but slowly he started changing this habit and used to reply me with 1-2 hrs. \\n\\nSo fast forward to today, we decided to meet and we did meet. We went to a bar, had couple of drinks. Yapped a lot. It was perfect. But then he casually told me that he is checking out some girl at the table. At first I was like ‚Äúhaha yeah right as if she‚Äôd choose you‚Äù like in a fun frolicking way. Then he started checking out other girls randomly and he was telling all these to me. I was getting uncomfortable and sad cause i was literally sitting in front of him and all he could see was the other girls. \\n\\nI had a lot to drink and so i confronted him then and there like why would you check out other girls when you‚Äôre out with me?

Do you think this is a date because I thought it was a simple meet and greet. \\n\\nNow here I knew that this might be platonic from his end but u was being delusional and thought no it might not. So I told him yeah I thought it was a date and I like you. I like talking  to you and I was looking forward to meet you.  Here he went completely cold and distant and he went like see i didn‚Äôt realise this was the case for you cause from my end i have been very clear that it‚Äôs a casual hangout for me.

I asked him how do you want to hang out the next time we meet to that he replied casually only and not to expect anything else. \\n\\nThis went on and i returned home.

I work from home, so our little unit is essentially a bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, and instead of a living room I have my workspace and the den in the big house is communal to all six of us so long as it‚Äôs kept up with. \\n\\nIn the morning long before I wake up, my partner will leave post it notes around if they need something for me since they work the crappiest hours.  This is normally stuff like when to heat up the dinner already prepped so he can eat and pass out when he gets home or asking to grab something from the house he left in the den, etc. \\n\\nThis morning he asked me to clean the den up after him. Not the first time; we‚Äôre all friends but some of us have different habits, work schedules, whatever so sometimes I wind up just doing it anyway cause I‚Äôm home and wanna be in a clean space. When I walked into the den I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if I missed a party or something. \\n\\nI don‚Äôt know who all was involved still, or what but when I saw the mess it looked like a group of freshly made pledges should be cleaning I just walked away. I made sure the big houses pets weren‚Äôt able to get to the mess, then went out till about an hour ago (11 pm) after having my phone of DND for most of the day. I‚Äôm used to cleaning bc I want to, not bc I have to. I‚Äôm an adult, and so is everyone else so I hated thinking they could take advantage of me being the only one home all day. \\n\\n Here‚Äôs the thing. I missed some post it notes in the den that my partner assumed I‚Äôd see while I was cleaning. One of these was apparently  along the lines of ‚Äúwake (housemate) up, you don‚Äôt have to do this all by yourself hes gonna do most of it!‚Äù Which is great bc when he did eventually wake up w/o me getting him he just did it so it‚Äôs not like everyone came back to ants or anything. \\n\\nHowever, some of them were more for just my partner and I. Like ‚Äútake meat out of freezer, I‚Äôll be home early want wanna cook for us‚Äù ‚Ä¶ or, y know, more importantly ‚Äúplease charge my arm, I wanna cook for us!‚Äù\\n\\nYeah. So. My partner has (a few kinds of) prosthetic arms. He uses the bionic for more ‚Äúdelicate‚Äù work but he‚Äôs still not very used to it and loses things so 1) I keep track of the charger and 2) he needs help putting it on and taking it off. From what I‚Äôve gathered he got help from housemates to set the arm on and gather unfrozen meat to start cooking ‚Äúfor when I come home‚Äù. Due to housemate cleaning the den before and not mentioning I wasn‚Äôt around to help, no one knew that I was angry or when/where I went since I wasn‚Äôt answering my phone. \\n\\nWell. The arm died when he was cooking, attaching him to the oven under the stove. He tried to continue cooking I guess, while also trying to undo the mechanic that locked the arm in place, and was shouting out the window to the main house hoping someone would hear him. I still don‚Äôt have all the details but it was about half an hour until someone got to him and longer than that for them both to get the arm undone so he wasn‚Äôt attached anymore. In the fight with it, he stumbled and burned his hand on the pan on the stove and left the arm hanging from the oven for me to fight with later. \\n\\nHe‚Äôs upset so I‚Äôm sleeping in my ‚Äúwork space‚Äù to give him room.

I‚Äôd walk down West Hollywood and have some drinks. \\n\\nI drink a lot as is and I had been boozing heavily in the last week with my buddies down south. This means I wasn‚Äôt holding back and probably had around 10-15 doubles of Jame-O. Fast forward to the last bar I was at, I was completely black out at this point and don‚Äôt remember leaving.\\n\\nHowever I do remember waking up in a frenzy. You know when you come out of a blackout and become conscious again. Well when this happened my face, eyes, and skin were on fire, and a rather large older ‚Äúrent a cop‚Äù (neighborhood security) was standing in front of me. He lets me know that he had maced me. Of course he also tells me that I ‚Äúpunched him in the chest‚Äù, I was definitely not at my air bnb, but in front of some high end house in a very nice neighborhood on the porch. How nice of my brain to basically shut down for the first part of me being maced in my face. As a result of all of this I began to yell in the face of the neighborhood watch, and in doing so spread the mace to all sorts of places on my body. In retrospect I could‚Äôve probably just ran considering the age and weight of this guy, and because technically he wasn‚Äôt a police officer. So if you‚Äôre familiar with LAPD, they are extremely slow to respond to any disturbance call. I got to sit on the ground and call this loser names for about 3 hours while my skin marinated in mace!  By the time LAPD arrived the owner of the home showed up and was just as confused as I was, luckily he didn‚Äôt press charges for trespassing. Lucky me, and because of all the commotion the neighborhood watchmen citizen arrested me, and it was time for my super chill trip to the holding station. Two lovely Latina police officers showed up and escorted me to holding. \\n\\nOnce there I was allowed to use the restroom, and buddy, no one told me I should‚Äôve held my member with a paper towel. I got to feel what it would be like if icy hot challenge met bear mace for a long time in a holding cell by myself. Now I have a battery charge and didn‚Äôt finish the DUI as I planned on doing. So, I spent 250 dollars on drinks, then got maced, spread it to my underside and had to walk 3 miles back to my place with 2 percent battery. I think it‚Äôs time I stopped drinking.\\n\\nThe best part is no one also told me that showering resets the mace! AND, according to Google all you can do is stand in front of a fan and wait for the mace to dissipate. ITS really cool that mace has almost no solutions that work quickly, and I got to get home at 7 am and sleep for 2 hours before the pain wouldn‚Äôt let me sleep! \\n\\nTL;DR by getting belligerently drunk, passing out on someone‚Äôs porch, and awaking to a horse helping of bear mace.

       " \"TIFU by not rescheduling my final, virtual, Interview while battling COVID - I'm posting this to get it off my chest about how disappointed I am with myself after messing up what I thought was a dream opportunity.\\n\\nFor the past few months, I've been going through an intense interview process for an Enterprise Architect position at Universal Studios. It was the 8th round of interviews, and I had already provided references, including at least two previous managers from my current company. Passing these references meant my current employer now knew I was looking for a new role.\\n\\nThe position was a perfect fit for me because I was already doing exactly what the job description outlined in my current role. The world around me was aligning in a way that made this experience feel like it was the role to have‚Äîit was going to be the fresh start I was needing in life. Being involved with an industry that I could be proud to work for because it focuses on providing experiences and distractions to millions of people a year (yes, it's all about the money, but the people going to these parks are also trying to get away from life). It felt like a **shoe-in**‚Äîeverything the company was looking for was right there in my experience. Life events were happening around me that pointed me down this path, making it feel like the stars were aligning for this opportunity. During the interviews, they quizzed me on things I was already excelling at in my current role, which made me feel even more confident about landing the job.\\n\\nAfter the references, I was told I needed to have a 30-minute conversation with the CTO and a manager in HR. They couldn't schedule both in the same meeting, so I ended up having the meeting with the HR rep right as COVID was kicking in. The meeting with the HR rep went really well‚Äîshe was thrilled with me and even asked if I wanted a job in HR, which was both unexpected and flattering. However, shortly after, my COVID symptoms took a turn for the worst, and my body told me to stay in bed.\\n\\nWednesday was the big day: my final virtual interview with the CTO's direct report. Unfortunately, I was in the midst of my 3rd day of COVID symptoms. I had been bedridden for two days, feeling absolutely horrible, but I didn't want to let the opportunity slip away or disrespect their time. So, I decided to power through and attend the interview while still recovering.\\n\\nDuring the interview, I tried my best to put on a good face and answer the questions, but deep down, I knew I wasn't at my best. I did mention that I had COVID, hoping it would provide some context, but I fear that my performance didn't reflect my true capabilities and leadership skills because of how sick I was.\\n\\nA few days ago, I received an email from HR informing me that I wasn't selected for both the role I had originally applied for but also another position I wasn't even aware I was being considered for. It hit me hard because this was a dream opportunity, and I feel like I messed it up by not rescheduling the interview when I was so unwell.\\n\\nI'm now reaching out to the recruiter to see if there's any chance for reconsideration or another interview, but I'm unsure if that's even possible. This whole experience has been taking a toll on me mentally, feeling like I let myself and potentially the company down.\\n\\nI feel like I have let myself down and even though they say everything is fine, I feel like I have let my family down. The past couple of years have been a struggle for us as a family because we can't seem to figure out which direction we want to go in life. With all the things aligning, like they were, this seemed like the option that would finally be the path forward for us all... only to be pulled out from under us due to me not putting myself first. Now, I sit here, not able to mentally align myself towards anything, and the reality of the world around me, of the things that I was going to be able to get away from or not have to deal with by going down this path, are starting to overwhelm me more.\\n\\nLooking back, I should have prioritized my health and communicated better about needing to reschedule. Instead, I tried to tough it out and paid the price.\\n\\n  \\n**TL;DR:** I regret not prioritizing my health and letting my illness affect this dream opportunity.

My poor performance led to rejection from both the role I applied for and another position I wasn‚Äôt aware of. \",\n",

       " \"TIFU by playing video games while my girlfriend was over  - So I was dating my then girlfriend at the time for about 10 months. We'd obviously been talking for a little longer than that. From the beginning of our relationship we basically lived together on the weekends. Spending the night at each other's houses from Friday night until Sunday night. We'd also see each other Thursday nights and text every night. The last month of our relationship was a little shaky.\\n\\nShe'd been looking another job for a while and I was trying to help her in her search. I actually found her the program that she's currently enrolled in. We'd also talk about it over text every night.\\n\\nSo one Saturday we went out with a friend and came back and I played some video games. This was only the second time I played my Xbox in front of her. After a while she got upset and said that I love the game more than her. I didn't really take that comment seriously because I'd tell her I love her every day but I stopped and hugged her but she said it was too late. She said she was stressed about her job related stuff and after I saw her get really upset I just turned it off but she was crying and decided to sleep in another room. At some point she came back in the room and the next morning was awkward. I didn't even know how to react to her because I was surprised she got that upset. She ended up storming out of my house and said that I wasn't there for her.\\n\\nAfter she left I found out she texted her ex as soon as she got home. I never brought this up and I don't think it would've made things better if I did. I texted her to see if she was alright and I apologized and said I was here for her. Admittedly I didn't think I was the bad guy and did anything that egregious but I just told her sometimes I like doing my own thing but I still loved her. I never played video games in front of her again. We still spent the remaining weekends together in their entirety.\\n\\nI felt bad because I made her upset. I just wanted to have fun on the Xbox for a little while after a long week and a night out. I apologized and never played video games in front of her again. But that was when she started talking to her ex and now she's going back to him.\\n\\nTLDR My girlfriend texted her ex after getting upset with me\",\n",
       " 'TIFU by following female cosplayers on Threads - The fuck action didn\\'t happen today, but the ticking time bomb caused by my actions in the past exploded today.\\n\\nAll because of fucking Threads.\\n\\nWay way back last year, when Threads launched, I checked it out. Used it for a couple days. Did a post, followed some accounts, and then proceeded to ingore it ever-after. Here is where the fuck up was planted.\\n\\nAmongst the brand new (at the time) Thread accounts I was following, I followed a bunch of content creators associated with Rooster Teeth. This included all the big names; Gavin, Geoff, Jack, Blaine etc.... and some of their partners that show up in content and voice actor/actresses on their shows. This is was the fuck up. \\n\\nI followed some ladies, such as Meg Turney, Jessica Nigri, and Lindsay Jones.\\n\\nI know they cosplay, but I\\'m not a big fan of that side of theor content. I recognise they do it well and move on if I ever see it, which is rare nowadays as I use social media very little. Never use instagram or X, only use facebook for messenger with older family, and i avoid tiktok like the plague.\\n\\nWell... With the seed planted, lets fast forward to tonight. I\\'m in bed next to my wife and while glancing over at my phone, a notification pops up. \"You have 1 new follower\". Its probably a bot, i swipe away the banner, but my wife gets curious. She wants to know who followed me. I say its probably a bot or nobody, who cares. She then gives me look and says aloud that she thinks I\\'m being dismissive too quickly. She has a lot of axieity and gets suspecious.\\n\\nSo she insists on looking and i relent. She opens the app and looks at the notifications. Its a nobody. But she then decides to have a look at the home page feed. One scroll down and she sees a Jessica Nigri cosplay post.\\n\\nAll hell breaks loose.\\n\\nShe immediately explodes and accuses me of cheating on her by looking near-naked cosplay models online. In her anger, she starts looking for more. Into my followers list. I\\'m a bit flustered because I had forgotten about who I followed on threads and can\\'t answer when she screams at me asking why I follow \\'naked\\' girls online. She find another ex-Rooster Teeth employee who posts cosplay pics. \\n\\nNow she explodes a second time and she thinks i\\'m a serial cheater, screaming i\\'m a dirty liar and a pervert.\\n\\nIt\\'s a full on meltdown and no matter what I say, it doesn\\'t get through. The way she expresses what she thinks at the moment makes it sound like I am actively going online to look up these women and self-pleasure myself to them. (A complete fabrication in her own mind). She claims that I must not love her and that she not enough to satisfy my \\'needs\\', which is also not true at all. I love her. With my whole heart. It\\'s killing me how upset she is.\\n\\nI try to explain to her that everything she is saying is not true and that I love her. Nothing gets through. \\n\\nNow i\\'m locked out of the bedroom. I can hear her crying and it breaks my heart. I\\'m afraid she might hurt herself, as she has gotten dangerously close to it in the past. Depression during covid-lockdowns hit her very hard. My axieity levels are through the roof right now.\\n\\nTl;dr Used Threads when it came out (and only then). Followed some ex-rooster teeth creators that are female cosplayers.

So this is me experiencing jet lag and I‚Äôm also seeing her for the first time in person. Does this make things better? Probably not, maybe makes it worse actually.\\nShe turns to me, almost nonchalantly as if she has already had this conversation with me before and could guess every word I‚Äôm about to say.\\n# ‚ÄúWould you still love me if I was a worm?‚Äù\\nAnd I failed. In my defense we had just woken up and I was still a little sleepy.

In my head I thought the two of us were on even terms there. In her head- I simply should have said yes and moved on. \\nLuckily I quickly defused the situation by looking up how to hold worms as pets. One of the tips was that ‚Äúworms need to wiggle‚Äù so I wrapped her in a blanket and shook her a little while making a dumb noise. That made her so happy and giddy that all was right in the world again but she did immediately tell her best friend who slid into my DMs to call me a dumbass and ask why I didn‚Äôt just say yes. She has reminded me several times of what I have said already and I get the feeling that she will not let me live this down anymore. Luckily she‚Äôs very easily distracted and I get her giggly with the ‚Äúworms need to wiggle‚Äù but even as I‚Äôm typing this I‚Äôm wondering what in the world I was thinking. \\n\\nTL;DR Igot asked if I would still love my girlfriend if she was a worm and said no. Don‚Äôt do that.\\n\\nEdit: Some of y‚Äôall worry me a little. This was a silly thing, not even that serious of a post but funny enough to write about.

Two Thursdays ago I forgot about the start time and logged in at 830 only to discover training had started already. Immediately I was lost.

       " \"TIFU by driving a friend away in game - A friend got me to reinstall and play GTA V Online again a few weeks ago, since he bought a new copy for himself since it was fully compatible with his Steam Deck (a hand held pc that uses Linux instead of windows).  He had previously had it on Playstation.\\n\\nWe played for the past few weeks.  Well about a week ago, after we are done heisting, I shoot him in game.  The game had put a bounty on him for leaving my motorcycle club.  I also hunt down our other friend who was with him, for the lolz.  I expect the other friend to retaliate, so I put down proximity mines behind me as I go hide in the mineshaft.  What I did not know is that there are cryptids (big foot) hidden in game, and that he was looking for one.  Going in the mineshaft to find the cryptid, he runs into the proximity mine and gets killed.  He gets angry and quits the game for a few days.\\n\\nI feel like an Asshat, so while I wait for him to return to the game, I do the setup missions (which are mostly annoying) for all the heists, even completing some of those heists to reset them in hopes for more/better loot, and doing the setup.  So I have 4 heists ready to rock, giving him all the fun without the frustration.\\n\\n2 days ago, Rockstar implements a new anticheat, which doesn't even work.  More importantly, it prevents anyone with a steam deck from playing GTA Online, meaning I can never make it up to my friend in game, nor can I play with him on that game.\\n\\nTL;DR I griefed a friend in game, making him take a break for a few days.  I was going to make it up to him, but the game developer locked out his device from the game, So I can't.\",\n",
       " 'TIFU by accidentally spilling hot water over the lower half of my body. - So recently, I had a runny nose which was lasting for a while and not going away. My parents recommended I boil water and try to take the steam from it as it should clear my nose. It made sense to me. \\n\\nI boiled water in a kettle and poured it into this mini pot, put it on a table and put my face over it. The issue was the steam wasn‚Äôt really going in my nose directly so I decided to put a towel over my head to cover the flow of steam, which means the towel was covering the mini pot. At this point, I am sitting on a chair with my head over the pot and a towel over my head. \\n\\nIt was working fine. The steam was clearing my nose. Then all of a sudden, someone called my name and I looked up. As I looked up, the towel got caught under the handle of the pan and it spilled all over my legs, and stomach. \\n\\nIt was scorching hot and I started screaming while jumping up rushing to take my clothes off. I literally took everything off in the kitchen and told everyone to not come there as I was butt naked in my kitchen with burns all over my legs, lower stomach and private parts. \\n\\nI tried to put aloe Vera gel and some other shit over it but it kills. Might go to the hospital idk. \\n\\nTL;DR: by accidentally spilling boiling hot water all over the bottom half of my body. ',\n",

My mom kept aside a pressure cooker in which she made rice and I didn‚Äôt pay attention to it. The pressure cooker was kept near the ingredients I had to use. \\n\\nSo in an attempt to quickly do the cooking, while reaching out for the ingredients, I picked up the pressure cooker not by its handle but like how one picks up a jar. I obviously forgot that it had freshly steamed rice in it. \\n\\nguess what happened next? Yes, it was too late by then. I let out a loud scream and dropped the hot pressure cooker on the ground. Its lid broke and all the rice cooked for lunch got spilled. \\n\\nI belong to an Asian household, so what happened next was not pleasant. Mother shouted at me because she didn‚Äôt realise I had burned my hand. Even I forgot the pain for a few minutes.

       " \"TIFU. Need Advice - TIFU. I cheated (maybe) on my girlfriend who lives in the same building with me. \\n\\nI met this girl in late December last year right around Christmas. Nothing happened between us, although we were hanging out occasionally on the terrace and having coffee. In February, we made out once after a party, and again nothing happened, we distanced for a while and then stayed as friends. Late march, early April, we kind of started seeing each other no definitions, very casual scene, soon after I fell sick , and she had a trip to Thailand so we were apart for two weeks or so, when I came back , I fell sick again and went home for 1.5 months, we were basically doing long distance in a casual scene. When I came back, we did have conversations about who we are and where this is going(more on this later). During this time, my ex girlfriend texted me and I sexted with her(not exact sexting but flirting with the idea, we previously have slept after the breakup as well, she texts me every month or two). I talked to her a 3-4 times once in may, once in July, twice in august but never slept with her. When I came back from home, we had this conversation about where this is going and she said she is not ready to call it a relationship yet, at this point, I realised I didn't want to do a relationship anymore either, and in my mind had decided that I will end things with her. but didn't do it then, because she was again going on a trip and I didn't want to ruin her trip. Two days before the trip, she asked me whether I want to call it a relationship , I Was unsure but still said yes. Two days later, she went to the Vietnam, I came back to my home. During the trip, we had a lot of fights, and I was getting sure that I will breakup with her, when she comes back. A day before coming back, I texted this girl from my past who I really liked at one point, congratulations ( she became a doctor) and we got to talking. Next day she asked to see me if I haven't  left?, we met for 15 minutes in the hospital she was working at. when I came back, I was talking to her, but my girlfriend and I were fighting and I didn't want to talk to her anyway. She came back on 3rd sep, I went to the airport, picked her up and couple of hours later, we again had a fight and broke up. We didn't talk for two days, and 3rd day I went back to her room just so we could end things on a good note, but out of guilt, I said let's try again, and that thing got prolonged for 12 days, one day, I was taking a shower, and she saw the chats with my ex girlfriend, I hadn't talked to her for a while since I didn't want to sleep with her. After this, again out of guilt, I said give me a chance, two days later she agreed, and immediately within minutes I told her about the Girl from my past. We started fighting again, I kept saying that give me a chance just out of guilt. I started having anxiety attacks as well, ( I have been depressed for 5 years or so). She helped me with it and so did I,( she also has same issues, and she has done self harm as well). We were spending time with each other to help each other, but due to guilt I was constantly giving her the option to get back. She said that until I leave the building(I have been considering this) , we can stay in touch, stay normal I decided I don't want this and have been staying away from her for the past 2 days. now I don't know what to do. Did I cheat on her? Should I get back to her just because of guilt and since I never wanted to hurt her? What should I do?\\n\\nTL : DR\\nI FUCKED UP WITH THE GIRL LIVING IN MY BUILDING. \",\n",
       " 'TIFU by accidentally gaslighting my roommate - Obligatory \"this actually happened over the course of months.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, I rent a house with two other people. One of them is 26M and has ADD, and is terribly scatter-brained. To the point where he struggled to keep a job. Something that really bothered me was that he\\'d often leave dirty dishes on the counter and just forget to do them. It would often be days before he\\'d notice or remember them. Sometimes I\\'d remind him and he\\'d say he\\'d do it but then forget again.\\n\\nI knew that he wasn\\'t doing it on purpose because he\\'d also forget things that inconvenienced him, e.g. cooking a large batch of food, leaving it to cool and then forgetting to put in the fridge later, wasting his time and money. I like to think I\\'m a considerate person, I started reminding him if I noticed it was getting late and his food was still out. I\\'d also put his milk back in the fridge or other things he\\'d forget about that could spoil.\\n\\nI also started doing his dishes if he left them out for more than a day, because it really bothered me and I honestly prefer doing them to having the awkward conversation. If he noticed he would ask me if I did them, and then apologize for leaving them out and ask me to just tell him to do them instead. But I\\'d done that and he\\'d forget again, so I\\'d just be dealing with the awkwardness for nothing.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne day he asked me when I **hadn\\'t** actually done the dishes, so I said no. He shrugged and said he must have just done them and forgotten that he had. The next time he asked, I was frustrated and a lightbulb went off in my head - I could say no and he\\'d probably assume he\\'d just forgotten doing them.\\n\\nI said I hadn\\'t, and it went exactly as I\\'d thought. I felt like a huge weight was off my shoulders, I could enjoy a cleaner home without having to play mommy to this guy.\\n\\nFrom then on I always denied doing his dishes, sometimes other things too. One time he went on a three-week trip and I went in his room and took out the dirty dishes and emptied his trash to prevent pests, because we\\'d struggled with flies.\\n\\nAfter a couple of months, he mentions to me that he\\'s seeking a proper diagnosis and medical treatment for his ADD. In this country it\\'s not particularly easy to get diagnosed and it costs a good amount money or a years-long waitlist. I encouraged him to do it because he clearly has problems. But then he admits to me that he\\'s been particularly concerned because he\\'s been forgetting things much more the last few months, particularly in terms of chores, and it\\'s been disturbing him.\\n\\nI felt terrible. I almost confessed, but I worried about the consequences and fallout. Instead I just tapered off doing the chores.\\n\\nI feel conflicted because my intentions were good and my actions also had good consequences. He told his doctor about his distress and she got him bumped up the waitlist, now he\\'s diagnosed and on Adderall. He seems to be doing a lot better in life, less forgetful, managing to hold down a job. But I still gaslighted him and caused him distress over a long period of time, so of course I feel guilty.\\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR - I lied and let my roommate believe he was doing his chores and forgetting about it, in order to avoid awkward conversations, and in the process made him think his mental health was deteriorating.',\n",
       " 'TIFU by taking my friend\\'s wife as a +1 to a religious marriage \\'course\\'... Bad Idea. - I don\\'t even know where to begin with this, the title makes it sound so bad but I don\\'t know how to word it better. I apologize for how long this post will probably be- I guess I\\'ll just start with some context.\\n\\nI (29M) and my wife Fiona (26F) have a stable, if somewhat generic, marriage. We have two kids (and a third that died). We have a solid friend group and a good family support system. Two notable members of this friend group are Garth (29M) and Cheri (24F). Garth is a friend I\\'ve had since high school and we still associate quite regularly. Cheri is Garth\\'s wife, who I also met back when she was dating Garth, and we had similar interests and became quite close, quite quickly. \\n\\nAt this point I am closer to Cheri than I am to Garth due to our similar interests. We\\'ve never crossed any serious boundaries except for on one occasion when we fell asleep together on their couch while watching a movie. Nothing happened, but things looked shady for a while. We\\'re now back to normal as both Garth and Fiona have realized it was an honest accident and nothing inappropriate happened.\\n\\nMy wife is quite religious, while I\\'m more of a \"direct spiritual connection to God\" type of person. As such we are both happy to be members of a small church that has a small community of friendly people. They do yearly courses and sessions on various topics, and one of the ones that was organized for this year was a marriage-related one. Essentially, it focuses on how one\\'s relationship with God will affect one\\'s relationship with others. Fiona and I both agreed that it would be nice to join the group. I spoke to Cheri and tried to convince her and Garth to join the group, and while Cheri was interested, she is a bit cliquey and didn\\'t like a few of the people in the group so she ultimately declined.\\n\\nSo the first session rolls around, and that self-same day one of our children is not doing so well. Fiona opts to stay home which means that I would be going to the marriage study by myself. The group chat for the session revealed that two men, of the \"more traditional\" members of the study, were also staying home that session, and those were the two guys that Cheri hadn\\'t wanted to be around while talking about marriage. I messaged this change of plans to Cheri and asked if she and Garth want to show up now that these two guys are gone.\\n\\nWhen I mentioned that Fiona is also staying at home, Cheri enthusiastically responded, \"How about I be your +1? Hahaha it would be so funny.\" I did think it was funny but I asked about Garth, which Cheri replied that he had just got home from work and could babysit the kids while she went out. Cheri checked with Garth and he was fine with her going out with me to the course just as friends. So, cue the TIFU, I decided to pick up Cheri on my way to the marriage course and show up with a +1 instead of, well, my actual wife.\\n\\nWell. It *was* funny. Cheri and I both laughed when she called herself my +1, and most of the other people in the group laughed as well. We explained the situation and everyone was mostly cool with it. During the session every so often when relationship topics came up, we would refer to our friendship as if it was a marriage that also had its issues and needed work, which was a regular source of comic relief for the group. Cheri also joked on our way back home that it was a good thing this particular session didn\\'t have any discussions involving the bedroom or we would have looked very unconventional indeed. She also told me she was glad she came along with me. So it essentially went as expected.\\n\\nWhat I did *not* expect was for one of the women in the group to call my wife the next day. I had made the mistake of not telling Fiona that I was taking Cheri as essentially a \"stand-in for my wife\" (as the woman who called Fiona put it). I came home from work to find Fiona very upset with me, asking why I hadn\\'t at least told her I was taking Cheri there. I explained that I didn\\'t think it was very important to brief her on every plan I make with my friends. Fiona replied that this was different because there\\'s an implied level of intimacy to courses like this and I had now created a semblance of said intimacy with Cheri. I did my best to assure her that this wasn\\'t the case, I simply like Cheri and was hoping that by coming along she\\'d be convinced to actually join the group (with Garth of course).\\n\\nFiona didn\\'t seem convinced though, probably due to the last time the boundaries had been accidentally blurred with Cheri. She went through my phone and read my messages with Cheri, which I let her do because I had nothing to hide. The messages revealed to Fiona that Cheri was generally the one to initiate contact with me, and that I was clearly the \"better person\" in our conversations, and that we never spoke about anything overtly inappropriate, and that if any boundary pushing had been happening at all, it was from Cheri, not me.\\n\\nSo now my reputation in the local community may have shifted because we all know how church people like to gossip a bit, and also my wife is unhappy with how I handled the situation.\\n\\nTL;DR took my friend\\'s wife to a marriage course because my wife had to stay home. A nosy member of the group called my wife and pissed her right off, and she started thinking I was cheating on her..',\n",

       " 'TIFU unknowingly calling a customer a slur - To be clear, this happened about last year but i still think about it because Spanish is the language of all time.\\n\\nFor context, i\\'m a Venezuelan-American. I was born in the US but i was actually raised in Venezuela for about the first 10 years of my life, this mainly consisted of visiting the family over the summer vacation (although i did spend one full year there when i was three, in fact my earliest memory ever is of my uncle tricking me into drinking beer at age 3 in a town called El Tigre). Obviously because of this upbringing i grew up fluent in both English and Spanish. The thing about Spanish though is that when you learn it, you\\'re learning it, you\\'re learning a specific version of it. English has it\\'s regional differences too but at least in my experience it\\'s not as big. Though the Spanish i speak is Venezuelan, growing up i at least knew that Colombians call beans \"frijoles\" instead of \"caraotas\" and that Spaniards use the \"vos\" prefix. Once i became an adult though, i came into much more contact with various different versions of Spanish.\\n\\nFrom confusing my coworkers by asking for a \"pitillo\" (straw in Venezuela, cigarette in Puerto Rico), getting confused when an Ecuadorean (i think) came into the store looking for a \"buso\" (jacket). But all of these usually result in a good laugh and we move on. Except for one time where i think the guy i accidentally offended was gonna take a swing at me. In the store i work at, we do offer free tailoring with purchase. This Salvadorian man came in looking for a suit and so we go to take his measurements. Now, we\\'re speaking Spanish here\" so i asked him \"por favor quitate las cholas\" or \"please take of your sandals\". And there\\'s the fuck up: he looked at me like i just called him the N-word. Because he could be heard across the store about how what i sad was bad, the manager had to come in to defuse the situation, explaining to the guy that i\\'m Venezuelan and we say different things or our words have different meanings. Thankfully it was resolved and he was able to get his suit.\\n\\nWhen i got home, i went online and searched if there were other meanings of the word. See, in Venezuela, as you have read, chola is slang for sandals. Yeah we say \"sandalia\" too but more often than not we\\'re saying chola (unless they\\'re from Maracaibo, that\\'s the Quebec of Venezuela). As it turns out though, in several Central American countries, of which include El Salvador, chola/o is an indigenous slur. Well. That\\'s the day i learned something. That said aside from being more careful, i\\'m not really sure what i\\'m supposed to do about it because that\\'s not what it means where i\\'m from. It\\'s like an Englishman not knowing the f-slur in the US does not mean what it means in England.\\n\\ntl;dr, nearly pissed off a customer because a word that has an innocent meaning in Venezuela is a no-no word in El Salvador.',\n",

       " 'TIFU by speaking during a meeting  - UPDATE: A lot of commenters here advised me to apologize. Not bad advice, but I decided not to, since in this case, calling attention to the gaff would have just made people remember it.\\n\\nI decided to proceed as though nothing happened. I showed up to work, led my team, did a fantastic job, everyone was satisfied. At the start of the day I got some weird looks and attitude from some of the upper level folks who were on the call. By the end of the day I could tell they had softened and were starting to forget. Maybe they are even doubting whether or not I was wrong. The one who yelled at me in the meeting almost seemed like she regretted it and amicably touched my arm as she was leaving. Drinks with coworkers after, and people were on my side.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs possible I was overreacting in the original post. But I think I could have been in real danger. If I made it awkward, it would have been awkward. If I had come in with my tail between my legs. If I tried to ask for their forgiveness, rehashing the whole conversation over and over. Knowing myself, I would have probably let it distract me from doing a good job, which would have made the whole thing way worse and cemented me as the office fuckup.\\n\\nInstead my attitude was, I‚Äôm here to do my job and be great at it, yes I said what I said and yes it was awkward, but let‚Äôs move forward. Thinking about it now, I wonder if my initial catastropizing reaction to the meeting was based purely out of fear for their over-aggressive reaction to what I said, rather than actual regret for what I said.\\n\\nI‚Äôm glad I decided to listen to all the folks in the comments who said ‚Äúno one will remember, and you may even laugh about this one day.‚Äù All of your kind and thoughtful words helped me navigate this situation.\\n\\nTL;DR Moved forward with head held high, did a great job at work, maintained dignity\\n\\n\\n\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\nORIGINAL POST:\\n\\n\\nI promised myself I wouldn‚Äôt say anything. I knew politically the best move was to say nothing. But for some reason, when I was asked to share my thoughts, I shared them.\\n\\nWhat came out was a confusing, disjointed mess. I sounded immature and irrational. I inadvertently ended up blaming some people at the meeting for problems that weren‚Äôt their fault. Problems that didn‚Äôt exist. I was emotional and over talkative. People were pissed.\\n\\nFor context, this was probably one of the most important meetings of my career. The first meeting to set the tone for my new administrative role. And I said everything I promised myself I wouldn‚Äôt say AND MORE. \\n\\nTalked shit about the previous people to hold this job. Accused people of not doing their job. Talked about rumors that were spreading within the company as though I believed them, rumors which were easily disproven. Complained about people not liking me. It was like I became possessed and over the course of that call, I watched myself alienate myself from every single person in the organization.

       " 'TIFU by turning my daughter into a wannabe Superhero with an incredibly strong moral compass... (UPDATE)  - Hello Everyone. \\n\\nI am not sure how updating works, but after the many responses I received yesterday I just wanted to keep you all in the loop of the situation. I asked the Mods if I was allowed to post an update and they agreed (Thank you Mods)\\n\\nIf you don\\'t know me &gt;[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1fi1dmw/tifu_by_turning_my_daughter_into_a_wannabe/) &lt; is my post from yesterday - \\n\\nFirstly, please can I thank everyone in the comments showing support and sharing your own stories. Thank you. \\n\\nI honestly thought, and still do to some extent, that I have f\\'ed up and failed my daughter. I thought her need to protect came from the fact she had seen me so broken. A comment which I have now lost said something along the lines of \"mummy got hurt by bad people, and now her friend is being threatened, so she wanted to stand up for us\". As honourable as that is, I don\\'t want my little girl to feel that way. I want her to be a child for as long as she can be. I want her to play with her friends and have no cares in the world apart from who\\'s going to be the goalkeeper or if she wants ham or turkey on a sandwich, do you know what I mean? \\n\\nI have spent some time with her over the weekend and last night reassuring her of that fact. I am always in her corner, I am always right behind her, and I will always believe her, no matter what. She has promised me going forward that she will always tell me, from the small things to the big things. I\\'m her Mum, no matter her age, she is always going to be my baby and I am always going to go to bat for her.  \\n\\nWe have also discussed if she feels safe in the school and if she feels the teachers would have dealt with it if she had told them - she said she feels safe, but she doesn\\'t know if they would do anything, but she has never asked. This is something I will be keeping an eye on and discussing with other parents if their children have similar feelings.\\n\\nSo, on to the update - My daughter is suspended until Wednesday. I had a meeting with the deputy headmaster, because the headmaster is \"unavailable\" today. \\n\\nAlex\\'s mum, who for ease I am going to call Joanne, had a meeting with him yesterday afternoon. For context, my meeting with him was about 20 min long. Joanne kept him locked in the office with her for nearly 2 hours. In those 2 hours, she made him go through chapter and verse the \"anti-bullying\" policy and explain each point to her. \\n\\nJoanne told me she had him admit that what the other child said to Alex alone should have been grounds for punishment. He still claims he had not been told about the threats and wants to open an investigation into his staff to \"get to the bottom of it\". Joanne told him she didn\\'t care right now how he handled his staff, he needs to stop trying to place blame elsewhere, and take accountability. She told him, her first and only concern right now was that her child had been at the school less than a week and had received a threat of death twice, and the only person being punished is the only person who stood up for him. He reiterated that \"we have a zero tolerance policy\" to which Joanne stopped him mid sentence and asked him why her son wasn\\'t included in that policy? He APOLOGISED and said \"I can see how that could look that way\", however he has not said how he would be fixing it because he has to do another \"investigation\"... I am starting to think he has a word of the day calendar or something. \\n\\nMy meeting with the deputy head was very basic, I think it was essentially just to placate me, but I have everything documented if I need to go through this again. My daughter has been suspended for fighting, she can return to school tomorrow morning. I did ask if the other child will be punished, but was told they can\\'t discuss the other child and TBH that is fair, but I will be monitoring the situation. There will be no behaviour report or forced apology.\\n\\nLast night, we went to Alex\\'s house and had dinner. Alex keeps telling my daughter \"you\\'re on my Christmas card list for life\". I don\\'t know where he got it from, but they think its hilarious. \\n\\nMy daughter has convinced Alex to try karate, they are very excited. Its karate night for us on Thursday, I will be talking with Sensei Paul about the altercation. Just so they can have a chat about safety, when to fight etc, more than anything else I just want her to be safe. She isn\\'t an army, she is still a little person and she needs to remember that sometimes. \\n\\nI also told my daughter I told her story to some people on line, and I showed her some of the nicer comments. I asked her if she would like to choose a name you can call her, she has chosen Hawk... suddenly something clicked into place. The flying punch she did, it was a \"cobra punch\", the character Hawk (Cobra Kai) does them a lot, you sort of kick your leg like you\\'re going to kick the opponent but instead move with a punch... NO ONE has taught her this move, but I have seen her jump off the settee and sort of do it before. When we started doing karate, I took that as an opportunity to introduce her to the the Karate Kid series, and obviously following that we started Cobra Kai. She is absolutly obsessed with Hawk and Tori (Minor spoiler for Cobra Kai &gt;!please don\\'t talk to her about the end of the last season, she is very upset with Tori right now!&lt;) So we have now had another discussion about how we shouldn\\'t replicate things we see in TV and Movies. Parenting is hard... and I have the teen years to come yet. I might just dye my hair grey now and get it over with.\\n\\nOne more thing I would like to address. I had two really horrid DM\\'s regarding Alex\\'s gender identity and sexual orientation - FIRSTLY, they are 9. He is figuring out who he is. If they are LGBTQ+, then that\\'s who they are, but its no one\\'s place but Alex\\'s to determine that. He likes bright colours, he likes how make-up and nail polish makes people look, he is just unapologetically HIMSELF, and we can all learn a thing or two about that.\\n\\nOh, another thing. I never understood why people felt the need to justify themselves to the people in the comments claiming their stories were AI generated, but now experiencing it, it kinda stings a little. I am not writing this for validation, I don\\'t know enough to care about whatever Karma Points are and I wouldn\\'t know how to use Chat GPT if my life depended on it. I can\\'t prove to you I am human, and this is real, nor does it really matter. But please be careful who you say that to, someone could be out here pouring their heart out and you completely diminish that by diminishing them. Just be kind to people, or don\\'t say anything at all. You know what they say, opinions are like arseholes, everybody has one and they all stink. \\n\\nAnyways. \"Hawk\" saw some of the comments saying she deserves a treat, a lot of you were saying ice-cream... she doesn\\'t want that. **She wants a sword**. Apart from being terrifying sometimes, I think she is going to be OK. I am going to buy her &gt; [this ](https://www.southernswords.co.uk/wood-grain-detailed-samurai-wakazashi-training-sword.html)&lt; training sword, and I think maybe some books about the Samurai. If anyone has any other suggestions, I am all ears!! I don\\'t know if they will be a good or bad role model, but she seems like she has developed a passion for martial arts, and I am all about supporting physical activities, but getting some history in there would be amazing too. \\n\\nI\\'m sorry, I intended to keep this brief, but I just seem to waffle. I think I need to find more adults to talk to haha. I was never much into journaling growing up, but I can see why people do it, its nice to just get everything in your head out of there and in black and white. Things can seem a lot more simple when they are on the page. \\n\\nAnyway - I am not sure what the future holds, but I know we will tackle it head on, sword in hand apparently. \\n\\nThank you for the love, I really needed it. You are all great people.\\n\\n**TL;DR - Daughter is suspended until tomorrow, headmaster ate a piece of humble pie and is possibly now traumatised, Alex is going to try karate and my daughter wants the internet to know her as Hawk and she** **also wants a sword.** ',\n",

       " \"TIFU by not checking the mailbox before my dad - Both my father and his wife like online shopping. Since they have a fairly trusting relationship, and my dad likes opening packages, he frequently opens packages regardless of whether the name on the box is his or his wife's. The issue that I over looked is that because of this dynamic, my dad apparently never actually checks who the mail is address to before opening it.\\n\\nI didn't want dad or his wife to even know that I got a package delivered, and I thought they wouldn't, since the postal service sends you a notification on the day that your package is set to arrive with an expected delivery timeframe. My plan was to watch the mailbox like a hawk during said timeframe and swoop the package out of the mailbox before anyone else even checks it. It was my mistake that on the day it was delivered I forget to check my email and subsequently miss the notification.\\n\\nMy dad knocked on my bedroom door, he cracked it open just a slither and handed me a clearly already opened package that he had poorly attempted to tape back shut. He apologizes and said he thought it was bike parts that he was waiting for, or something that his wife had ordered. What was actually in the box was a strap-on and 100ml bottle of lube.

       " \"TIFU by turning my PC into a vacuum cleaner - I hate getting dust out of my PC. When I got my current PC years ago, I wanted to take extra precautions against dust getting into it, partly because it's equipped with massive fans. That's why, in addition to the dust filters that came with my case, I bought and made extra dust filters for the exhaust vents of my PC. It's a weird PC case that lets air in at the bottom and lets air out at the top. I thought it made sense to protect the top vents where dust would fall in when the PC wasn't on. So, weird case that sucks air from the bottom with massive fans and blows it out on top. For years it went great, and the inside was practically dustless.\\n\\nThen, without me noticing for months, the bottom dust filters had gone missing. Sucking up air basically from the floor, and giving it no way to exit, due to my customized filters.

       " 'TIFU by turning my daughter into a wannabe Superhero with an incredibly strong moral compass... - To preface this story, I am going to start with my opinion - I do not believe what my daughter did was wrong. In fact, I am incredibly proud of her, even though she may have been overzealous, her reasoning are very much in the right place. We have discussed at length what she should do if ever in this situation again (which I hope she is not).\\n\\nSo, lets start in the beginning, as it is the best place to start.\\n\\n(TL:DR at the bottom, as per tradition - also, just letting you all know this is a new account and my first time posting on Reddit - long time lurker - if I did anything wrong, sorry)\\n\\nI, 35F, have a wonderful 9 year old daughter. She is smart, and outgoing and just incredibly strong. 2 years ago, me and my ex-husband divorced. He fell out of love with me and fell into the bed of a 21 year old, its a story as old as time, but it doesn\\'t hurt any less. About 6 months ago, I was mugged on my way home from work. I was messed up, I was covered in bruises, and in a lot of distress mentally. My ex is not a present father, he moved to France for work about 3 months after the divorce was finalised, so he wasn\\'t able to help look after my daughter while I was healing, she spent some time with my Mum. But she saw me at my worst.\\n\\nI have a lot of guilt about that.\\n\\nShe began getting very anxious to leave the house, she didn\\'t want to leave my side. She was worried Mummy would get hurt again.\\n\\nA friend of mine\\'s son was being bullied at school a while back. She enrolled him in some karate classes, not for fighting, more to build his confidence and it really worked for him. She suggested that maybe putting my girl in some classes may help her feel more secure. I suggested this to her and she wanted to do them, but wanted me to do them too. Which to be honest, was probably a very good decision - I spoke to the Sensei and asked if I could sit in on the beginners class with her etc. I explained the situation, and he agreed.\\n\\nWe both loved it, she picked it up so quick and she loved the play activities with the other children. A few months after we started, she was leaps and bounds ahead of me and ready to play with a more advanced level of students. The bonus of that is the night the advanced kids met, was after the beginner adults met.\\n\\nSo we changed out nights, I started training with adults, she carried on with the advanced kids. She has picked it up so quickly. Her confidence in her ability is sky high too.\\n\\nA few times when we have been out she has seen something that has worried her, like someone walking towards us and she will grip my hand a little tighter and move herself in front of me. I keep reminding her I am the adult, we are safe and this is not her burden. (For anyone wondering, Mental Health Care is hard in the UK. We are not very well supported, she has spoken to a counceller that works with her school, she hasn\\'t said that she needs to see anyone more, but we are on a waiting list. Therapy never hurt anyone, so why not look into it. But I can\\'t afford to go private and the NHS just takes a very, very long time)\\n\\nFast forward a few weeks, last week was her first week back in school after the summer holidays. There was a new student in her class, we will call them Alex. Alex and my daughter have become the fastest of friends. She couldn\\'t stop speaking about him on Monday when she came home from school. \"Alex likes this food\", \"Alex likes this TV show\", \"Alex said\", \"Alex did\" etc. Its adorable, but my kid has took it upon herself to be Alex\\'s bodyguard. Alex is a very expressive child. They wear a school uniform, but Alex like\\'s to wear nail polish, he has long hair which they wear pulled back or in a plait. He has bows on his shoes. He just wears what he wants and has the confidence to rock a potato sack if that is what he feels comfy in. His parents are amazing too. They have been so welcoming of my daughter and me too. We have had drinks this weekend after the incident and they are wonderful people.\\n\\nSo, the incident.\\n\\nLast Thursday, Alex changed his black nail polish for a deep plum purple colour. Some of the boys in their class decided to show how bad their upbringing was and told Alex \"you\\'re a boy, you shouldn\\'t wear girly things, because thats what makes you gay\". Both Alex and my daughter told them to shut up, and go bother someone else. This is when one of the bullies says \"If you\\'re wearing girly stuff tomorrow, I\\'m going to kill you.\" (Yeah... you read that right).\\n\\nSo my girl, being a defiant little menace decided she wasn\\'t going to tell an adult (we have had a very long conversation about this, don\\'t worry) and she was going to handle this herself... Alex also decided he was going to handle things his own way too.\\n\\nFriday morning rolls round, the plum nail polish has gone and in its place is the most beautiful and vivid pink you have ever seen and his hair was in an elaborate viking style plait. It must have took a while. It was stunning.\\n\\nWell, apparently, this was like waving a red flag in front of the bully boys face. He marched up to Alex and told him he was going to kill him at lunch time. My girl told him he could try but she wouldn\\'t let him.\\n\\nLunch came around and they were outside for playtime. True to his word the bully started to run at Alex and my girl took him out.\\n\\nNow, bare in mind up until this morning I only really had the details from two nine year olds. So when Alex told me she flew, I was fairly hesitant to believe him. He told me she punched the boy in the face, made him bleed, which made him cry and now he is petrified of her.\\n\\nI got a phone call from the school after lunch asking me to come and pick her up because she has been suspended for fighting. Alex was refusing to leave her and saying that if she was suspended so was he because it wasn\\'t her fault. Alex\\'s dad arrived at the same time I did to collect out kids, the headmaster told us that it was pending an investigation and we would be called in for a meeting on Monday.\\n\\nObviously when my daughter told me the full story I was livid, I asked why she didn\\'t tell a teacher, she said she wanted to handle it so he knew he couldn\\'t threaten people, but she told a teacher after the fact and they didn\\'t believe her. So I am even more livid at this point. I contact Alex\\'s parents and discuss, have a drink, bond over our kids etc.\\n\\nSo... this morning. 8am rolls around, I am sat in front of the headmaster, he begins to bemoan about how my daughter has brought violence to the school, how she has broken a boys nose and I SHIT YOU NOT, how this is very unladylike behaviour. I was honestly aghast. \"We are a zero tolerance school when it comes to violence\"... My daughter had been stood on top of a little wall at the edge of the playground, essentially keeping watch. She saw the kid running towards Alex, when he got close enough she launched herself off the wall, straight at the boy. She essentially did a flying punch, landed on him and then proceeded to lock her arms in his and keep him in place until the playtime supervisor arrived.\\n\\nI asked him how his investigation has gone, and he said he has spoken to the boy and because this was a \"completely unprovoked attack\" my daughter would be suspended further for the week, with a behaviour management programme and she would be expected to appologise to the boy she hit. I\\'ll be honest guys, I have never been the confrontational type, I think it skipped a generation. But in that moment I summoned the spirit of my little girl.\\n\\nI asked him how he could have completed the \"investigation\" if neither my daughter, Alex or the parents had been involved. How he had come to such a conclusion without any facts or evidence? He just stumbled over his words. I asked him \"so is this what happens when students call someone names and threaten to kill them? You punish the person protecting them\". He was silent and said it was the first time he has heard of this and that he had been told it was unprovoked and my daughter was the only aggressor. I asked him who told him this and he was silent. I then called him a liar and that he was informed of the situation because both my daughter and Alex told him. I left the meeting telling him that my daughter was not suspended, however she would not be in school until the situation had been dealt with to a satisfactory conclusion. I have emailed her teacher and asked her to forward any work she would have been doing in class and she will do it from home.\\n\\nI have her with me in the office today, and my boss is letting me work from home for the rest of the week.\\n\\nI know I am responsible in part for what she has done, I know violence isn\\'t the answer. I am very proud of her for standing up for what she believes in, but we have had a talk about how she needs to always tell me things like this.\\n\\nI am furious with her school. I called Alex\\'s mum when I got out of the meeting. Alex isn\\'t in today because they are having a meeting this afternoon about the bullying Alex has been subjected too. She has supported my actions though and said that if she doesn\\'t get the right response today she will be pulling Alex too.\\n\\nThere aren\\'t many primary schools locally that will have space left for them if the best decision is to pull them out of this school permanently, but I am not happy with how the headmaster has dealt with the situation to be honest.\\n\\nThanks for listening. I just needed to word vomit into a void.\\n\\nI have fucked my daughter up royally, I know.\\n\\n**TL;DR - My daughter used her karate training to defend her friend from a boy who said he was going to kill him. She broke his nose, but the headmaster is only punishing her. I am livid.**\\n\\nEdit: I‚Äôve posted an update - [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1fj0vcw/tifu_by_turning_my_daughter_into_a_wannabe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) - ',\n",

I (23f) get a job at a well known company at a very hands on job and start dating someone (21m) in another department about a month and a half later.  We don‚Äôt directly work together so theres not really any issues.  I move around to a few departments but never to his so we still don‚Äôt work directly together.  About 6 months ago I get a promotion, but still no issues because I‚Äôm not his supervisor since we‚Äôre still in different departments.  Here‚Äôs where it starts to unravel even though I was unaware of it until a few days ago.  In my department, there are 3 supervisors and we work rotating shifts.  Not long after I promote, one of the other supervisors steps down and I was assigned a lot of his shifts.  There is one guy (19m) In my department that comes in an hour after me so after we got to know each other a bit we started talking quite a bit while working since we were the only ones steadily in the department for a few hours in the morning.  He is very nice to everyone so I never thought of it as anything more than coworkers talking.  About 3 weeks ago, my boyfriend and I broke up and one of the first people I told was the guy I talk to a lot at work.  He would always ask if I had plans, and suddenly I didn‚Äôt anymore so my answer became, watching tv.  A couple weeks ago, he had mentioned a movie he wanted to go see and I had said I wanted to see it also.  About a week ago, he mentioned he had plans to see it and asked if I might want to go.  I denied because I thought it would be awkward to go to a movie with my employee.  A few days ago, he asked again if I had plans, I said no watching tv.  He told me that movie was really good and said if I wanted to he would go see it again with me.  I didn‚Äôt really say anything, then decided why not I‚Äôll go.  We got something to eat, went to the movie, and went and sat in the park, next to theater for a while talking.  I had a good time.  The next day, we were short staffed so I called him and a few others in for some overtime which he gladly accepted.  We left at the same time and he asked if I had plans again to which I told him the same answer and he had asked if I wanted to try this restaurant he had been talking about for a few months and I had mentioned I wanted to try it but had never been.  I didn‚Äôt really respond, then sent him a message later that I would go because I wanted to try it.  After dinner we sat by the nearby river for 4 hours talking.  This is when I really really realized he wanted to be more than friends.  After talking very discreetly with another coworker about it, he had mentioned he noticed that this has been building up For a while and I was unknowingly feeding into it the whole time.  I really enjoyed spending time with him and getting to know him, but I can‚Äôt date someone in my department since I am his boss.  I messaged him explaining the situation and now I feel terrible about it.  Maybe in another timeline we could be something more, but it just can‚Äôt work without me risking my job.\\n\\nTL;DR I accidentally went on 2 dates with my employee then texted him that I can‚Äôt hang out with him anymore even though I had fun because I‚Äôm his boss.

       " \"TIFU by talking shit  - Before I start, just wanna apologize for any improper grammar or if anything doesn't make sense, this has been eating me up and it's really late. I've always had issues with friends, I've always felt like everyone has a secret negative feeling about me. Last year, I got in a class with someone who I hadn't talked to for a few months, and because they were the only person I knew, we started to be friends again. For privacy sake, her name will be Janice. So, she re-introduced me to a mutual friend of ours who I also hadn't talked to for a while, Susan for privacy. I'm not sure why we stopped talking, I think just during the summer neither of us started a conversation so nothing really happened. Anyways, we all started to be a little trio and we texted almost everyday for a year because Susan didn't go to me and Janice's school. We all started to get really close and became bestfriends. I started to notice that Susan was a bit annoying to me but I didn't say anything to her or Janice. Then, Janice texted me after her and Susan had a little disagreement and was basically complaining about Susan. This is where it went all downhill. I agreed with Janice because I had also gotten into arguments and disagreements with Susan. Fast forward a little and we texted each other about annoying things Susan had done so much that it had just become part of our friendship. I honestly have no idea why I was friends with either of them because Janice's jokes sometimes went too far and Susan just annoyed me and we didn't really have anything in common. Me and Janice started to talk about things that Susan would tell us about her personal life as explanations for why we thought she acted the way she did. For example, if Susan would say something about one of our dirty rooms, we would get annoyed, text each other, and say how *event that happened in her life* was the reason why she commented on it. I don't know if it makes sense i'm so tired. It was all fine until Susan logged into Janice's account and read me and Janice's messages because she had a feeling that we were talking shit. For context, Janice told Susan her login to her account when Janice got her phone taken away and she could message people for her. So, when Susan read some of our messages, she logged back into her account and wrote two huge paragraphs on how disrespected she felt, how we betrayed her trust, and used things she told us personally against her. And i agree, we did all those things and it was shitty. We were a pair of two faced bitches. I private messages Susan to try to apologize to Susan, and she accepted even though I think she shouldn't have, and Janice said barely anything. The only few messages she said back was defending herself and bringing up how Susan also talked shit about this third girl, let's call her Rea, and her life and how messy it was. For some context, Rea is diagnosed bipolar and I also think schizophrenic. Susan basically said that she was aloud to talk shit because Rea was horrible to her and made her life hell, which she did. I know this sounds like stupid high school girl shit but Janice's mom messaged my mom asking how is she and I can't have her find out and I know she should know but it will take away the little trust I have from my parents. I talked to Susan today and she still seems upset, understandable, but I just want both of them to go away. I feel so messed up because I don't even feel guilty about saying that stuff, although I am so spooked I will never say anything bad about anyone ever again, I just feel guilty about her finding out. This is all making me realize that I never wanted to be friend with Janice or Susan in the first place, it had just been years since I'd had a proper friend that I felt like I could connect to. It also turns out that Janice was twisting some of my words to make Susan also lose in her trust in me. I've also realized I have a lot of pent up anger from when I went through something similar like a few years ago and I think the only reason I just want to run away and hide is because I never confronted the people who treated me like doodoo and we didn't a speak after Covid. Ok I don't know what else I can add or how I make this sound better I have not proof read this I am so tired it's like midnight \\nTL;DR basically i befriended a shitty person and i said shitty things about my friend about stuff she told us personally, i apologies she forgave (she shouldn't have) she only found out cause she logged into shitty friends account and read messages, we made her mom cry, shitty friends mom messaged my mom asking how she was, i scared help what do i do\",\n",

I put blazing hot water into the mop bucket and dumped it in the toilet, hoping to boil the shit loose, I guess. What do you know, ...nothing fucking happened. That shit log was acting like it thought could save the world by clinging to the sides of the pipe or whatever. At this point, I had spent over 25 minutes in the bathroom trying to plunge the toilet, and I decided that it wasn\\'t working.\\n\\nI came out of the bathroom, and luckily nobody was waiting to use it. I grabbed a bottle of heavy duty degreaser, and dumped a generous amount into the toilet. I then let it soak for a half hour while I took a delivery. When I got back, I tried to plunge it again, but it was just as stubborn as when I started. Feel free to say I\\'m an unintelligent species, but I literally gave up. There was the perfect amount of water in the toilet to look like it wasn\\'t clogged until you flushed it.\\n\\nI kind of feel like I may have booby-trapped the toilet, but what was I supposed to do? Go to the manager and be like \"hey, so I layed the fattest shit humanly possible in the toilet and now it\\'s permanently clogged.\" I worked the rest of my 5 hour shift, and nobody mentioned anything, so for all I know the toilet is still occupied by the nachos I ate last night.\\n\\nTLDR; I clogged the work toilet with the world\\'s most enormous shit, and I think it\\'s still clogged.',\n",
       " 'TIFU - I live in Queens, NY. And I added a girl from Long Island on Snapchat just over a month ago and she is very beautiful. We had been talking for the past month and we related on a lot of things. I became very interested in her. Two of my cousins were getting married during this month as well and when their weddings were over, we made plans to go bowling. Tonight we went bowling together with one of her friends and it was amazing. She was everything I thought of and more. Beautiful, funny, and we vibed perfectly. Fast forward to when we leave, we go by her car and hug each other and that leads to use kissing for about 30 seconds. We had some alcohol (not that that‚Äôs an excuse for my following behavior) but I pulled her back in for another round of kissing and even insisted that we go to my car on the other side of the parking lot so I can kiss her a little more in private away from her friend. She insisted she had work in the morning and that she should get home. I grabbed her arm again and then let her go abruptly and she hit the car in the back but was fine and then went home. She texted me tonight saying my behavior was disgusting and that she never wants to me see me again. I was absolutely in the wrong for what I did. I will never forget her. She was everything I wanted in a girl. This may be Karma but I know I deserve it. I‚Äôll never forget about her. And I‚Äôll never forgive myself for my behavior. \\n\\nTL;DR: Messed up with a girl I liked because I was being to aggressive in wanting her to kiss me and she cut me off for life. Never gonna forgive myself. ',\n",
       " 'TIFU - I Got in a Mosh Pit - This happened today. I am 45 and I live a pretty quiet life. I have a professional career, I knit, I garden, and I bake cookies. I‚Äôm a grandma for Christ‚Äôs sake but I‚Äôm still a punk rocker at heart. \\n\\nThe husband had zero interest in the bands (tasteless heathen) so he was hanging out in the shade while I went down closer to the stage. I haven‚Äôt seen some of these bands in over 20 years and well guys, I couldn‚Äôt help myself. I jumped in the pit. \\n\\nIt was a tame pit, most of us were middle aged, but somehow I made contact with the wrong person in the wrong way and lost my footing. I went down on the asphalt HARD and rolled. Some sweet guy snatched me up and set me on my feet and I was right back at it but once the adrenaline wore off. Damn. I fucked up. \\n\\nI banged up my wrist, I‚Äôve got a good case of road rash on my leg, shoulder, and arm, and I tore my hand up nicely. I‚Äôm already pretty sore and I know I‚Äôm going to have many physical regrets tomorrow but i won‚Äôt regret the memories. \\n\\nTL;DR I got in a mosh pit when I‚Äôm officially too old for that shit.
